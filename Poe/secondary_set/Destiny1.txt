castle his piper and his tartan his forestsand his deer his thousands of acres of untroddenheath and his tens of thousands of blackfacedsheep and his bands of bonneted clansmenwith claymores and gaelic and hot blood anddirksall these and more had the chief of glenroyfor he had a familytree upon which all thebirds of the air might have roosted doctor johnedestinyson to be sure has said that there are no suchthings as family trees in the highlands but thedoctor's calumnies against trees of every descriptionor rather of no description throughoutscotland are too well known to require refutationglenroy therefore had a tree and as for hisrentroll it was like a journey in a fairy tale longer and longer and longer than i can tellhowever as the chief himself was not particularin ascertaining the precise amount of hisincome but lived as if the whole highlands andislands with their kelp and black cattle hadbeen at his disposal it would ill become hisbiographer to pry into the state of his affairs forthe gratification of the curious suffice it thereforeto say that the chief of glenroy lived in astyle which was deemed suitable to his rank andfortune by all and they were neither few norfdr between who partook of his hospitality inperson as in fortune glenroy had been equallyted he was a tall handsome man with fineregular features a florid complexion an openbut haughty countenance and a lofty thoughdestiny somewhat indolent air the inward man wasmuch what the outward man denoted he wasproud prejudiced and profuse he piqued himselfupon the antiquity of his family the heroicdeeds of his ancestors the extent ot his estatesthe number of his followers their physicalstrength their devoted attachment on theother hand he was of an open temper of a socialdisposition liberal to his tenantry generousto his dependents and hospitable to all hismanners though somewhat coarse were by nomeans vulgar and when a little under controlhe could be both pleasing and gentlemanly inhis deportmenthis supremacy being universally acknowledgedthroughout the extensive district wherehis possessions lay he bore his faculties withthat sort of indolent pomp which betokens undisturbedpower he felt himself a great man and though he did not say even to himself thathe was the greatest man in the world he certainlywould have been puzzled to say who wasgreatersuch was glenroy and with all these ad destinyvantages it was naturally expected that hewould form an alliance worthy of himself andhis clan all of whom identified themselves withtheir chief and consequently looked upon hismarriage as an event in which they had an undoubtedinterest as it was impossible howeverthat any one so great in himself could makea great marriage his friends and followers begreasonable people merely expected that he wouldmake the best marriage possible greater speculation could scarcely have beenexcited at the court of king ahasuerus as to asuccessor to the rebellious vashti than that whichprevailed amongst the clan on the subject of formingk suitable alliance for their chief each hadhis favourite and exalted fair in one or other ofthe most illustrious scottish families on whom heconceived that glenroy should place his affectionsbut vain are the schemes of man i insteadof these glorious results glenroy did what manywiser men have done before him he feu in loveand made what wait called a most unaccountablemarriage for he married a merely prettygirl of neither family nor fortune the orphandestiny daughter of a poor hundredth cousin of his ownthe fact was glenroy was too proud to considerit a matter of much importance whom he married he could derive no consequence from his wife his wife must owe au her dignity to him thiswas a blow to the clan which all the youthbeauty and sweetness of the lady could notreconcile them to and it was not till the birthof an heir that they recovered their spirits butthen bonfires blazed bagpipes played spartanswaved whisky flowed all in short was doneto welcome to this vain world an heir to its vanitiesalas how shortsighted are sometimeseven secondsighted mortals at the end of two years a daughter was bornbut fax otherwise was her birth commemorateda lifeless mother a widowed euler a funeralprocession tears regrets lamentations andwoe these were the symbols that marked herentrance into life and cast a gloom upon herinfant days the child was christened edithafter its mother and so ended glenroy's firstattempt at connubial happiness destinychapter iiglenroy mourned the loss of his wife asmuch as it was in his nature to do but he wasnot the man either to live with a breaking heartor to die of a broken one in due time thereforeit occurred to him that great as his lossappeared to be it was nevertheless one whichmight be repaired but too proud and indolentto take any measures for the accomplishment ofhis design he left it entirely to time chance orcircumstances to carry it into effect and thesedid seem to conspire to bring it to pass duringan occasional visit to london he more than oncehappened to find himself in parties where he wasso much in the background that but for thenotice of the lady elizabeth waldegrave he'would have passed almost unobserved greatas glenroy was he therefore found he was capableof being still greater yet greatness bydestiny means of a wife a woman and that wife anenglish woman this was a startling thought tothe proud chief but his stay in town was protracted he continued to meet the lady elizabethwho was so very affable and agreeable such an enthusiastic admirer of tartan and highlandbonnets and highland scenery that glenroywas captivated and he even came to theconclusion that he would not be the worse forbeing connected with some of the highest familiesin the kingdom then although ladyelizabeth was somewhat passee she was still ashowylooking woman quite suitable to him inpoint of years and more likely to make a goodstaid stepmother than a younger wife would havebeen to be sure she was not very brightbut glenroy hated clever women they were allso managing and manoeuvring in short from anadmirer the chief became a suitor and thoughthimself a lucky man when he was the acceptedlover had glenroy been better acquainted withthe character and circumstances of the lady hewould not have been quite so much elated withhis good fortunea destinylady elizabeth waldegrave was sister to themarquis of heywood and widow of the honourableedward waldegrave a fashionable spendthriftwho had closed a brief career of follyleaving his widow and infant daughter to thecharity of relations it may be supposed thenthat lady elizabeth's circumstances were anythingbut affluent she was in fact struggling tokeep her place in society upon a small annuityfrom her fatherinlaw lord waldegrave whohaving had to pay largely for the extravaganceof his son was little inclined to be liberal tohis widow and child glenroy's proposals thereforecame in good time and the union beingof course warmly approved of by the lady'sfamily and connexions no obstacle stood in theway so that as soon as the lawyers and millinershad done their parts the marriage wascelebrated with the utmost eclat on the oneside there was a special licence the presenceof a prince of the blood the benediction of anarchbishop with peers and peeresses lace andpearls a magnificent saloon an elegant dejeunera line of splendid equipages c suchdestinywas the scene in st james square while atthe glenroy anne the event was celebratedby a numerous meeting of the tenantry and vassalsof the chief with barbaric pomp a roastedox and half a score sheep barrels of ale andbowls of whisky long speeches loud shoutingtoasting cheering bonfires bagpipes and thehighland flingmuch as glenroy loved pomp and retinue hewas somewhat startled at the magnitude of hislady's bridal train in addition to his own travellingcarriage and servants there followed misswaldegrave's equipage containing that younglady about five years of age her french governessand english subgoverness and attended byher own maid and the lady elizabeth's footmenglenroy thought less might have served her but it was too soon or rather too late to say so and lady elizabeth expatiated largely upon thegoodness of old lord waldegrave in allowingher to take his favourite son's only child to scotlandwith her the chief tried to feel sufficientlygrateful for ike favour conferred upon him inthis addition to his family but in spite of destinyself he felt something like shame at this importationto glenroy the arrival of the new marriedpair was celebrated with great rejoicinglady elizabeth was dressed in the clantartanwore a highland bonnet looked well made aspeech and was at once pronounced to be a mostcharming womanbut scarcely were the rejoicing over beforeglenroy began to suspect that he had not drawnthe capital prize in the marriagelottery andthese his first faint misgivings began to assumea less questionable shape as the features of thelady's postnuptial character became to be morefully developed at length they boldly resolvedthemselves into tastes habits and pursuits of themost decided dissimilarity from her husband'show it happened that this discovery hadnot been made before marriage instead of afterwas one of those mysteries which though ofonion occurrence have never yet been fullycleared up to the satisfaction of singlemindedpeople whence it is that two persons whoseem to have been born only to hate each otherwould under any circumstances ever fancy thatdestiny idthey actually love each other is a phenomenonwhich even philosophers may have encounteredbut which they certainly have not yet explainedno two human beings born and bred in a civilused country could be more different than thechief and his lady and as both were independentand both had arrived at years of discretionit seemed but natural that they should remainas fate seemed to place them perfect antipodesthe lady had been accustomed to a gaylondon life and she had also heed abroadshe had seen much of the world and the worldhad seen much of her she had been admiredfor her talents her manners her music hertaste her dress and although the admirationhad long been on the wane the craving stillcontinued she was in fact when without heradventitious aids a mere showy superficialweak woman with a fretful temper irritablenerves and a constitution tending ta rheumatismwhich she imputed entirely to the climateof scotlandin direct opposition to all this glenroy detestedlondon despised every part of the globe destinysave scotland hated all music except that ofthe bagpipe had little enjoyment in any societybut that of his mends and followers and whenhe spoke of the world meant only his own countyand clan he had also become subject to attacksof the gout which he ascribed to hisvisits to london and therefore vowed he neverwould set foot in it againalthough glenroy saw much good companyat his hospitable mansion yet it was only duringa short period of the year for the highlandsmay be said to open for the season as the king'stheatre shuts and thanks to grouse and deerthe one has become almost as fashionable a placeof amusement as the other during this seasontherefore lady elizabeth lived pretty much inher own element but when that was over along and dreary interval ensued not that thehouse ever emptied of visitors be the season orweather what they might but the company wasnot suited to her taste for it must be ownedglenroy was not nice in the choice of his associatesalthough his vanity was gratified withoccasionally entertaining the best in the landdestiny still the same principle together with his loveof ease made him prefer in general being whatis called the king of his companyamongst sundry of his adherents whose personsand manners were particularly obnoxious to thelady elizabeth the most offensive was the lairdof benbowie friend and clansman of the chief'swho from having been all his life in the habitof paying long and frequent visits at the castlehad gradually become domesticated there to theinfinite annoyance of its mistress the lairdof benbowie was an elderly man of the mostordinary exterior possessing no very distinguishingtraits except a pair of voluminous eyebrowsvery round shoulders a wig that looked asif it had been made of spun yam an unvaryingsnuffcoloured coat and a series of the most frightedwaistcoats that ever were seen benbowie'smental characteristics were much upon a parwith his personal peculiarities he was made upof stupidities he was sleepyheaded and absentshe chewed tobacco snored in presence slobberedwhen he ate walked up and down with a pairof creaking shoes and drummed upon the table destinywith a snuffy hand nay more with that sameobnoxious snuffy hand he actually dared to patthe head or shoulder of the elegant refined misswaldegrave as often as she came within hisreach but all these things were mere leatherand prunella to his chief whose feelings andperceptions were by no means so refined as hislady's benbowie was the very apple of his eyefor he was devoted to him he never contradictedhim or rather he invariably coincided witehim he rode with him or walked with himor sailed with him or sat still with him heplayed at backgammon with him and when therewas no one else did well enough to be beatenat billiards yet no one could call benbowie ahangeron for he had a good estate and a prettyplace of his own both of which he neglected forthe sake of living with his friend and althoughhe was not profuse of his own money yet to dohim justice he was equally sparing of his chief suwhat pleasure or profit glenroy could findin benbowie's company no one could discoverbut so it was and glenroy could have betterspared a better man although if pressed for adestiny reason of his preference he could only have resolvedit into that unanswerable argument jei'aime parceque c'est lui c lady elizabethhad at once attempted to expel benbowie fromthe house but she might as well have attemptedto move one of his own brown mountains benbowiewas invulnerable in his stupidity and obtusenessand nothing less than the united effortsof the fairy and the genie who lifted up princecamaralzaman and carried him a thousandleagues without waking him could have madebenbowie dream of leaving a house where habithad completely domesticated him and where hisinstinct made him feel comfortable and happysome one has well said lorsque ne pentteindre une lumiere on seen laisse clairerbut lady elizabeth did not adopt this wisemaxim she could not extinguish benbowie'slight faint and dark as it was neither would shepermit it to shine even in its native dim eclipsethe consequence was that poor benbowie whoseemed to have been born without a single sparkof fire in his composition became a sort ofsmouldering brand in the fiunily of his friend destinyas neither the chief nor his lady were youngenough to be moulded anew or wise enough tomake the most of what each mutually thought abad bargain it may be supposed their lives didnot glide away like that of parnell's hermitin one clear unruffled stream but rather resembledthe course of their own mountain torrentswhich chafe foam murmur and take then ownwaydestiny chapter iiitime rolled on but did nothing to smooth theasperities of glenroy and his lady pride wasthe ruling passion of both and unhappily therewas no mutual object on which they might concentratethis predominant principle the ladyelizabeth added no branches to the family tree and thus the unjust and overweening partialityof each parent for their own separate offspringcontinued to grow with their growth andstrengthen with their strengthsuch was the state of the chief's family whenhe received a visit from his brotherinlaw sirangus malcolm with his only son a spoiledhandsome boy about the same age as his cousinnorman sir angus was a widower and had beenrecently appointed to a high command in indiawhither he was to proceed when he should have destinyfound a situation for his son suited to the anxietiesof a fond parent but that was a matter ofdifficulty as indeed it must

angus had a fine estate but it wasloaded with debt time selfdenial and managementmight have retrieved it but to waiton the one and submit to the other was not inthe nature of an impetuous openhearted openhandedhighlander and he preferred the easiertask of retrieving his fortune by methods morecongenial to him in a foreign land his onlycare was to secure a safe and happy asylum forhis child and as besides being allied to glenroyby marriage he was also his nearest kinsmanby blood he flattered himself the chief wouldtake charge of his son and educate him with hisown his only doubt was with regard to ladyelizabeth of whom he had not heard the mostfavourable reports but he was a sanguine goodnaturedundiscerning man and his little misdestinygiving were quickly dispelled by the affectionateand gracious reception he met with glenroywas more than hospitably kind and his lady wonby the admiration expressed for her darling andthe beautiful presents bestowed upon her acteda most amiable and delightful part glenroy atonce anticipated the subject uppermost in thebreast of the parent by inviting him to leavehis boy with him during his absence and in afew minutes all was settled to the mutual satisfactionof both parties lady elizabeth wasflattered by seeing that it was to her the fatherlooked for care and protection to his son andher vanity was gratified at becoming the patronessof the young heir to an ancient title andnoble fortune but above all her favour wassecured by the predilection evinced by the youngreginald towards morinda upon being askedby his father which of his two cousins he wouldchoose for his wife he declared instantly in savourof morinda as being by far the prettiest he thenfollowed up the avowal of his admiration withan offer to marry her which was no less promptlyfreed to on the lady's part especially when she destinyheard of the gold and diamonds and pearls thatwere awaiting herthe little florinda was indeed an uncommonlypretty child with a skin of dazzlingwhiteness a profusion of golden ringlets largeblue eyes a sylphlike figure and an air of distinctionwhich although not always the accompanimentof high birth is rarely to be seenexcept among

that followed aggravatedas they often were by nursery maids to whoma spoiled unruly boy is always a subject of tormentand of course of blamethe consequence was her fondness for reginaldwhich had always beei of a very precariousnature now turned into downright aversion while he unused to control at home andencouraged by glenroy in all his freaks sether authority completely at defiance even benbowie his tobacco his snore his shoes andhis waistcoats almost all ceased to be objectsof animosity compared with this new annoyanceat length matters came to a climax andthreatened to add one more to the many proofthat great events do often spring ft'om trivialcausesone day when the two boys and edith werevol i b destinyengaged in some play in which florinda wasdeemed incompetent to join to get

soonforgotten the watch was opened examinedwound up and broken sublunary revenge isalways the first impulse of the childish heartand reginald in his rage shook florinda withallhis might slapped her on the cheek and evenleft the print of his nails on her arm her shriekssoon brought lady elizabeth to the spot whenshe found her darling almost convulsed withterror and indignation st this rude assault theextreme fairness and delicacy of her skin renderedthe slightest touch at all times perceptibleand on tide present occasion showed the offencein glowing colours and told a tale of outragethat raised all the mother in lady elizabeth'sbreast in vain did norman and edith attemptto palliate the offence by detailing the provocationsand declaring that reginald had not meantto hurt her they were sure he had only justdestiny given her a slap for breaking hifi watch ladyelizabeth would listen to nothing but the sobsand exclamations of her darling till at lengthshe worked herself up to assert and of course tobelieve that her child had been seriously hurtand would have been killed had not she cometo her rescue the whole was wound up withthe soothing assurance to her angel that thesavage should be

herdetermination of leaving the house and takingher child along with her unless her demand wascomplied with this threat being treated withanger and derision led to a scene of altercationand mutual recrimination when peopleare ready primed for quarrelling a very littlematter will serve the purpose just as a singlespark applied to a train of gunpowder will dothe business of an earthquake so it was withgienroy and his lady it had been with them for many a day and now fromless to more from bad to worse it ended in athreatened separation the lady declared shewould go and the chief would not ask her tostay glenroy would have been the last manto have turned his wife and her child from hishouse however obnoxious they might have beenand he felt rather annoyed at the thoughts ofsuch a thing being said but he was too proudto betray his feelings or to make any confessdestinysion he merely contented himself with remarkingto benbowie that if her ladyship chose to goshe might go she was welcome to go or stay forhimvery right glenroy on my consciencethat's very right responded benbowie but ifshe goes i wish you may not have to aliment herthe acrimonious feelings of the parents

provocation being given andtaken in full measure in vain the gentle edithstrove to reconcile them no sooner was an oldoffence patched up than a new one broke outand the only thing they both agreed in was inliking herit was at this crisis that an afflicting dispensationin the waldegrave family accelerated theseparation between the chief and his lady atthe time of their marriage lord waldegravehad

be considered as future baroness of wadegrave with such prospects before her ladyelizabeth felt as if there were degradation inher remaining longer under tie roof of a coarseoverbearing highlander and shetherefore signified her intention of immediatelyremoving her daughter to england in order to benear her aged grandfather she yielded so fourindeed as to say that provided glenroy wouldsend the boys to school and engage to spendeight or nine months of the year in or near londonshe would have no objections to pass theother three or four in the highlands but anindignant refusal being returned

own choice the chosen of manycandidates the church having become vacantby the death of the former minister muchcanvassing and competition had of course ensuedand at least twenty licensed graduates destinyhad presented themselves each with testimonialsand credentials enough to have entitled them toa bishopricput of the two whose recommendations caresred most weight the one was the present pastorthe reverend duncan m'dow and the otherwas of the evangelical side a party whom glenroyalthough professing christianity held inthe utmost abhorrence not that he knew verywell what it was they did profess he only giiesied it was something he did not practise hehad a vague confused apprehension that natievangelical pastor was a sort of compound of apopish priest a stiflenecked presbyterian asourfitted covenanter a lankhaired secedera meddling jesuit a foultongued john knoxa what not that had evil in its compositionno reasonable person surely can doubt thatthere have been and still are many bright ornamentsof the church amongst both parties cfchristians and it is much to be lamented whenprejudice runs high on either side and a man isapplauded or defamed not according to his practicebut his profession as little may it bedestiny questioned that in their respective congregationsthe wheat and the tares grow promiscuouslyeven to this day but this was not theview glenroy took of the subject and he wasloud against all highfliers newlights gospellersbigots zealots enthusiasts saints and soforthbeinga moderate man he like all moderatepeople was most violently opposed to the admissionof any person of that description within theprecincts of the parish as the other heritors werefew in number the patronage in this instancewas conceded to him and his choice fell upon thepresent minister who had been twenty yearstutor in the fiunily of the laird of kindlesand who never had been branded with any ofthese appellations but bore the character of beingan easy goodhumoured sensible moderate manwho troubled nobody but minded his own affairsthis last qualification he certainly possessed asglenroy soon found to his costthe reverend duncan mdow was a largeloudspoken splayfooted man whose chief characteristicswere his bad preaching his love of destinyeating his rapacity for augmentations or as hetermed it fermentations and a want of tact inall the instances of life which would have drivenlord chesterfield frantic his hands and feetwere in every body's way the former indeedlike huge grappling irons seized upon everythingthey could possibly lay hold of while the latterwere commonly to be seen sprawling at an immeasurabledistance from his body and projectinginto the very middle of the room like twoprodigious moles or bastions he dealt much instale jokes and bad puns he had an immensehorselaugh which nothing ever restrained andan enormous appetite which nothing seemed todamp and which he took care always to supplywith the best things at table he used a greatquantity snuff and was for ever handing abouthis mull an ugly cow's horn with a foul dingycairngorm set in silver on the top to sum us personal enormities when he spoke he hada practice of always advancing his bu as closeas possible to the person he was addressingalthough a strongbodied sturdy man he wasextremely careful of his health and even in adestiny fine summer's day was tx be seen in a hugewoolly greatcoat that reached to his heels trottingaloi on a stout dun pony just high enoughto keep its master's feet off the groundsuch were the outward man and beast theinward man was very much of the same stampmr m'dow's principal object in this world wasself and his constant and habitual thoughts hadnaturally operated on his outward manners tosuch a degree as to blunt all the nicer perceptionsof human nature and render him in verytruth his own microcosm he was no dissemblerfor a selfish dissembler is aware that in order toplease one must appear to think of others andforget self this fictitious politeness he hadneither the tact to acquire nor the cunning tofeign consequently he was devoid of all themeans of pleasing not that we mean to recommenddissimulation or to insinuate that mr mdow would in reality have been a better manhad he been able and willing to form himself onthe model of the chesterfield school he wouldmerely have been less offensive in the ordinaryintercourse of life and would have sinned less destinyagainst the common observances of society bathad he been earnest in his calliiy had he soughtto have his mind enlightened by the knowledgeof those divine truths vrhich he professed toteach their unction would have softened andrefined even the ruggedness of his nature andhave rendered him an object of respect insteadof a subject of ridiculefrom the moment he was ordained ministerof the gospel mr mdow had done nothingbut make demands for augmentation of stipendenlargement of glebe additions to the mansenew offices and so on now there was no skyin which his money could go that was so unsatisfactoryto glenroy as when it was claimed as amatter of right more especially by the clergywhom he looked upon as the worst species oflandtax besides like all idle indolent peoplehe had an utter abhorrence of every thing thatoccasioned trouble or was a bore and mr duncanmdow was a bore that beset him on all sideshe was a stumblingblock in his path a thorn inhis side a weed that had taken root in the veryheart of his estate and which it was impossibledestiny for him to extirpate true he was not molestedwith spiritual admonitions plans for buildingchurches subscriptions for establishing schoolsor schemes for employing the industrious orpeering the indigent or reclaiming the wickedr but then he was haunted with estimates foretdaing the manse and repairing the bam orhints for rebuilding both house and offices orhe was beset with a copy of the new locality oranextract of the last decreet or a notice of asecond summons for augmentation or an interlocutorof the teind court in favour of someother minister one or other if not all of whichmissiles mr mdow bore as constantly abouthis person as a highwayman does his pistolsbut what provoked glenroy even more than allthis was the utter impossibility of overawingthe minister or keeping him at a proper distancefor mr m'dow possessed that sort of callous goodnaturewhich rendered him quite invulnerableto all rebuffs as well might a needle have beenapplied to the skin of a rhinoceros as a gibe orataunt to the feelings of the minister theywere all received as good jokes which onlyvol i c destinycalled forth roars of laughter in return besidesthe impression was so completely implanted inhis brain of glenroy's extreme predilection forhim from having appointed him his pastor inspite of all opposition that any thing he now saidor did could not possibly remove it in a wordhenry the second and thomas a becket werea joke to glenroy and mr duncan mdowdestiny chapter vilglenroy's property was too princely in extentto admit of any very near neighbours who couldvie with him in state and consequence yet twoof his nearest kinsmen had

bythe flimsy forms of fashion and etiquetteall that glenroy's eye looked upon of hill andglen lake and forest were his own with theexception of one single feature in the landscapeand that the fairest in au the goodly scene thiswas a beautiful richlywooded promontory whichstretched far into the bosom of the estuary thatalmost siutounded it and gave it the appearanceof a sylvan isle it had once formed part of the destinyglenroy estate and had even been the originalseat of the family as was indicated by somegrey ivygrown walls wluch crowned the summitof one of its green knolls but by one ofthe many mutations land is subject to it hadbeen severed from the greater part of the propertyand had passed to a younger branch ofthe family by whom it had for generationsbeen possessed this younger branch had nowdwindled away to one sear and yellow leafa rich and childless old man who lead lately succeededby the death of a nephew whose firstact upon coming of age had bee to repair andfurnish such part of the old castle as could berendered habitable for the shooting season hissuccessor was not personally known in the countryas he had left it at an early age to push hisfortune in a remote provincial town in englandand had only visited it once since glenroy hadlong looked with a wistful eye towards this propertywhich indeed was the very crown jewel otthe fondly and for which he would gladly haveexchanged many thousand acres of muir andmaintain but hitherto he had coveted in vailbestir au his overtures had been rejected for to tell truth glenroy had every thing but moneyto offer for it and money unfortunately is theonly thing that ever induces pecle to part withtheir lands but now he seemed in a sur wayto gain possession of it not by conquest asthe law terms purchase but by gift or inheritanceas he said he was the nearest heir to thechildless old man who waa now the proprietoreven if it had been otherwise it was of littleconsequence as the property was not entailedand it was but natural to suppose he would leaveit to him as the rightful owner and the head of thefamily especially as he could have nobody elseto leave it to having quarrelled with all of

the possessor of a paternalarm and the stiver of eight children in earlyuse he had made a love massage with a lady ofgood family and great beauty but no fortunethis step had of course displeased the

and delicatelybred had followed her husband through all thechanges of a soldier's life had shared his hairships and privations with cheerfulness and badnow refused with him to a bleak highland firmwith that contentment which was ready to findgood in every thing if their claims had beenstrictly investigated it would probably have beenfound that captain malcolm was still more nearlyrelated to the inch orran branch of the familythan the chief himself but his chance of thesuccession was such a hopeless one that he neverhad allowed himself to indulge the slightest expectationin his first outset in life he haddisobliged mungo malcolm the present proprietorby refusing to be received into his officedestiny and bred to his profession that of a scrivenerone offence was quite sufficient to make anenemy for life of mungo malcolm but whenthis act of disobedience was followed up by rash and imprudent marriage assurance was madedoubly sure the door was completely closedand barred against him and it seemed as if littleless than a miracle could ever open it againwhen this family first came to the neighbourhoodglenroy had shewn them considerablekindness and attention in an ostentatious patronizingway and they had received his favours aspeople willing to be obliged because they feltthat in similar circumstances they would havebeen happy in obliging others but at the saidetime the chief's pompous civilities were metwith a simple courtesy which while it showedthey were not insensible to them yet denotedminds of too elevated a cast to be overwhelmedby condescension or oppressed by trivial favoursthis however was what glenroy could not understandand did not like he was more lavishthan generous he gave freely but he loved to destinybrandish his favours and always looked fqr janimmediate return in gratitude or adulationthe calm manner and moderate expressionsof captain malcolm were therefore ill calculatedto feed the cravings of his vanity boast ashemight his boastings never called forth anybursts of admiration or applause from his poorkinsman nor did all the display of his wealthand state appear to excite the slightest envy oreven astonishment in his breast yet therewas nothing sour or cynical in this plainnessnothing that betrayed a contempt for what hecould not attain on the contrary his mannerswere mild and pleasing to all who could valuesimplicity and sincerity and he was ever readyto commend and admire when he could do soconsistently with truththere is perhaps nothing more baffling topride than when it meets with contentment inahumble station it

the limits of their intended stayall householders whatever they may pretendmust at some period or other have groaned underthe indefinable misery of an undefined length ofvisit and every family must

for visitingas it had for its oatmeal and potatoes a rest daya dress day and a press day were the appointedmeasure of a visitor's days the first was conseparated to repose after the fatigues of the journeywhether there had been a journey or not the second was allotted to showing off the fulldresssuit prepared perhaps for the occasion destinyand the third was delicately appropriated to thepressing solicitations of the host and always conferredas an act of bounty over and above thusboth parties were pleased the presser and thepressed the presser at having conquered thepressed at having conceded and thus they partedhappy to part happy to meet and hajy topart againbut since this barrier has been broken downby modem innovation visiting has no longerany limits except such as exist in the minds ofthe respective parties and accordingly there'sthe respect that makes cautious people pausebefore bringing upon themselves a visit avisit how vaguift how undefined how darkhow immeasurable how obscurehow unfathomable how mysterious is a visit a visitmay be meant for a day or a week or a month and it may be taken for a winter or a summeror a year a visit may be the cement of

it was quitelost upon the guests inch orran if he noticedat all noticed only to hate such trumperyand his lady did not know a dirk from a deer'shorn glenroy's attempts at striking them withawe on

must havedropped it on the road or simon must have seenit or it must be in mr malcolm's pocket for itcould not be lost and it was not about her andshe shook herself round and round in testimonythereof

for it they lamented for it theypoked about for it in all improbable as well asimpossible places in short all the energies oftheir heads hearts and hands were put in motionfor the recovery of the

trying to recover it a monstrous wave hadswept it away and he could see no more of iti'm sure i never know whether to believesimon or not said the lady to mrs macauley for i think he'll say any thing

taking the glass of wine wouldhave forced it to his lips but he shook him off nothing will make me drink wine said hefirmly oh you are a turk a mussulman aturk a turk shouted the two boys in derisiona spark shot from the corner of inch orran'seye as he turned abruptly away muttering somethingbetween his teeth the rain fell withoutintermission for the rest of the day which seeihed of endless duration to both parties and glenroy was at last obliged to have recourse to mrsmacauley's much despised musical powers tawile away the time destinychapter xiithe following day cleared up and there wasa bright sun and a sweet blowing wind andevery thing looked gay and every body pleasedexcept inch orran who minded neither sun norwind and was alike insensible to the charms ofnature and the influence of weatherglenroy had invited a large party that is hehad summoned all who were within call to dohonour to his kinsman's visits and the housewhich indeed was seldom empty had continuedto fill during the whole morning with invitedguests as also with chance droppersin of variousdescriptions the chief felt as if there wassafety om his kinsman's illhumour in the multitudethat surrounded him his courage rosehis spirits revived and he was himself againbut it was a transitory calm the dinner hourdestiny was drawing near the guests were all assembledwhen suddenly borne on the breeze camethe distant neighing of a steed glenroy startedand turned red another and another loud andlong and shrill and joyful burst it was thewellknown happy neigh of amailye announcingthe approach of mr duncan mdow hadthe castle possessed a drawbridge it certainlywould have been raised on the instant but asthere were neither javelinmen nor moat tooppose him the minister rode boldly on arrayedas usual in his large woolly greatcoat and redworsted comfortermrs malcolm caught the sotigh of his namesand thereupon thought proper to address glenroy is that the mr mdow that was so good asto call one day at inch orran what an uncommonpleasant sensible wellinformed man he is i was really very much pleased with him he'sso polite and wellbred and has so much to say he seems a very superior man it must be a greatadvantage to have such a man for a clergymanand i'm sure you have great credit in your destinychoice for there's really something so very ahem a so imcommonly sl a s much ofthe gentleman about him'glenroy disdained to reply here the announcement of mr mdow put astop to the remarks and presently his heavyfoot announced itself although there was alarge assemblage of ladies and gentlemen presentmr mdow as usual made a point of grapplingwith each individually right and left hereand there cross hands and down backs in themost indefatigable manner then fastening upmhis host he burst out with one of his itvaht courierroars of laughter well glenroy there's one thing i'm sureyou'll not say of me as was said of a poor friendof mine who was thought rather neglectful ofhis parish in the visiting way and something toometaphysical in his discourses om his pulpit it was really very ready said sho hoch how that he was a most wonderful man for he wasinvisible six days in the week and incomprehensibleon the seventh very clever ratherdestiny severe to be sure but ic was really just thetruth how how ho hoehglenroy was not like hamlet he could haveused daggers but he could not speak them hedid not excel in repartee at any time for whenprovoked he was instantly in a passion and nptdaring to give scope to it in the present instanceall he could do was to dart a furious glance atthe intruder and turn on his heel but heel ortoe it was all one to the minister who wasquite insensible to all rebuffs especially as hemet with a warm reception from such of theparty as being more remote and inaccessible intheir dwellings and having nothing to say asto the augmentation were not favoured with somuch of his company in their ovm housesand as one person of easy manners no matterhow vulgar sis always acceptable to theguests whatever he may be to the host mrmdow's bad jokes and hearty laugh were verypalatable to some of the party who found themmuch more relishing than the overbearing pompof glenroy or the morose silence of inch orranmr mdowj therefore was very soon riding on destinythe rigging of his own good spirits and pealupon peal roar upon roar followed in quicksuccession and raised many an echo from thelower orders of the company his staying todinner wa a matter of course in the first fluidof his gratified feelings at having got the man ofhis choice a moderate man an honest fellowand also pleased dth the convivial habits andjolly manners which he saw would be no restrainton his own glenroy had in a rash moment givenhim a general invitation to his house which theminister had not been slack in availing himselfof particularly if there was any thing going onthat promised better cheer or more amusementthan common as surely therefore as glenroyhad any new arrivals of consequence or a largeror more ceremonious party than usual or anextraordinary influx of company or any strangersof great distinction he might depend uponmr m'dow's dropping in it was quite wonderfulhow and where he acquired such speedyand certain intelligence for in a remote andthinlypeopled country where dwellings werefew and far between it could neither be by seedestinying or hearing or smelling but so it was nowild indian could have tracked his prey withgreater certainty and finesse than mr mdowdid a good dinner indeed nothing could surpassthe accuracy and success with which hefollowed the trail of a jolly party or what hetermed an innocent recreationglenroy having surmounted the first shock ofhis appearance though still boiling with wrathagainst him resolved to make it pl that hiscompany was not expected at dinner and thereforesaid in his stateliest manner you are toolate for luncheon mr m'dow but if you wishfor any refreshment i shall order some to theeatingroom for youyou are really extremely kind and considerateglenroy replied his guest with muchhearty warmth of manner but it is quite unnecessaryin you to put yourself to that troubleas i had a snack at your friend captain malcolm's and indeed i was pressed to stay stillthere which i would have done if i had notpreviously intended mysdf the honour of takingmy poduek with you as you were so very polite destinyas to assure me of being always welcome a piece of kindness and hospitality which i am sure ishall never forgetthat's just as it should be remarked alaird who had three ferries between him andmr m'dow there ought always to be anopen door to the minister it's b pleasant thing to see the heritors andministers on a friendly footing said anotherwhose tends were valued and exhaustedin that respect i have really reason to beproud said mr m'dow rapping his mull withan air of modest importance for ever sincemy induction i have met with uncommon attentionand hospitality not only from my respectedpatron here but likewise from the very gentlemenwho thought proper to oppose the presentationthere's captain malcolm for instancehe was very keen against me more so indeedthan

awaywith for a time he gave full play to his passionsand like a very dragon of dd breathedape and fiery all around but as what is violentis never lasting he soon cooled down to hisusual temperature and being of a sanguine dispositionhe even began to look upon what hadpassed as a sort of bad joke or illnatured whimof the old man's which would go no farther andwould not be followed by any bad consequencesthe calm however was of short duration thefirst intelligence he heard was that ronaldmalcolm had been invited to inch orran anddestiny was actually living there in high favour with hiskinsmanthis went so far beyond glenroy's worst anticipationsthat he disdained to be in a passionabout it he was perfectly cool and composedas every body might see only his colour wasconsiderably higher than usual and though hehummed a soi it was much out of tune andwhen he laughed very heartily nobody knewvery well what it was at in short he had allthe gaiety and indifference which people commonlyhave when very much agitated and disnecessary for glenroy either to sing out timidor laugh out of time or contradict his son or doany thing put of the common course of natureit was reported that ronald malcolm so eurfrom having been invited to inch orran hadbeen sent there by his father to try to bribingabout a reconciliation that instead of that liehad met with a very bad reception and

and you have so greata variety of jane views in your neighbourhoodthat i warn you you will find it difficult to getrid of her again ru take my chance of that captain witha prodigious roar of delight i'll take mychance of that and now captain will you notjust do me the favour to fix a day dipn misslucy and you will ride over and take a look ofmy premises we had better take our chance of a fineday said lucy who privately thrust theminister's absence was not the worst that couldbefit themi beg your pardon miss lucy but reallythe disappointment would be dreadful if i wadto miss the honour of a visit from the captainand you perfectly dreadful and it miffkt happenfor i have occasion to be a good deal fromhome in fact i consider it as a principal partof my duty to visit a good deal and to be on thebest footing with the heritors of my parish it's destinya discreditable thing when the minister and thegentry are no just at one and wherever i havebeen i have always made a point of keeping thevery best company a clergyman who fedthfiilly discharges hisduty must see great varieties of company saidcaptain malcolm and ought neither to considerhimself as elevated by the notice of thehigher orders or debased by mingling occasionallywith the lowest and poorest of hisflockthere i perfectly agree with you captainreplied mr mdow with much hearty warmth these are precisely my own sentiments on thesubject from the honourable nature of myoffice i have always looked upon myself as upona footing if not rather shoopayreor to gentlemenof larger fortune and who may perhapsmake a greater dash in the world than i do andon the other hand i never refuse when properlycalled upon to attend to the poorest man orwoman in the parishthis was uttered with a modest air of selfdestinyapprobation and concluded with a long selfcomplacentpinch of snuff there is indeed a reverence due to theclergy as a body said captain malcolm andin a christian country they are always sure ofmeeting with it but that is a feeling whichoperates very slightly upon the minds of thecommunity and unless ministers can claimindividually the respect due to superior pietyand excellence i fear collectively it is of littleavail you're perfectly right captain i agreewith you entirely every clergyman is calledupon to keep up the dignity of his station andto cut a respectable figure in the world itdoesn't do for a man to let himself down toomuch in my opinion a clergyman who is in theway of his duty never can let himself down said captain malcolm for he must be endeavouringto raise the minds of those around himto the highest standard of moral excellencethat s really not an easy matter captainsaid mr m'dow for the common people are destinya bad set but here comes mrs malcolm ihope i'll get her on my side to fix a day for thevisit to the manseand herewith mrs malcolm was assailed withentreaties to use her influence for that puisseor as the minister elegantly expressed it justto nail the business at

asudden gust of wind and rain came sweepingalong and all the beauteous scenery was in aninstant blotted from the sightcaptain malcolm was not a person to be disconcertedby trifles but on the present occasionhe could not refrain from expressing his regretas he every moment felt an increasing repugnanceto the company of mr m'dow and hisfriend and still more on lucy's account thanhis own it seemed like contamination for sodestiny fair and pure a creature to be seated betweentwo such coarse barbarians mr m'dow affectedto sympathize in the disappointment but itwas evident he was exulting in the delayshower after shower followed in such quicksuccession that lucy found the object of her visitcompletely defeated at length the clouds rolledaway but the day was too far advanced to admitof farther tarriance and besides both the fatherand daughter were impatient to extricate themselvesfrom the overpowering hospitalities of mrmdow i hope you will have many opportunities oftaking drawings here said he with a significanttenderness of look and manner as he assistedlucy to mount her pony and when the manseis hurled and i get my new offices the viewwill be much improvedlucy bowed as she hastily

mild the herds and flocks were croppingdie dewy grass the declining son shot a slaiitand mellow radiance and all things seemedimbued with new life and beauty captainmalcolm and his daughter proceeded for somtime in silence each felt the beauty and theharmony of nature and as they slowly pacedside by side amongst the windings of the greenhills they needed not words to utter the feelingsof their hearts captain malcolm was the firstto speakyou are unusually meditative lucy saidher father what is engaging your thoughtsso much i have been thinking papa said lucyrousing herself from her reverie what a sweetthing silence is that is to say you admire silence as labuyers did solitude oh certainly silence is sweeter whenshared with another who can understand itsbeauty but after such a day such a coarseunpleasant day as we have spent even solitarysilence would be sweet and grateful had mrmdow given us some nice clean wellboiledpotatoes and milk and have allowed us to walkabout and enjoy the beautiful scenery howmuch more pleasantly and profitably the daywould have been spent mr mdow is indeed a coarse specimen ofa coarse propensity said captain malcolm and has fallen into a common error that ofseeking to raise himself by appearances as ifthese could exalt the character especially of aminister of the gospel of one who is as pooryet making many rich as having nothing andyet possessing all things one is always pleased with the humble areof a cottage said lucy and i am sure most destinypeople would feel additional respect for the simsjcity of a clergyman's or indeed any one'sstyle of living when proportioned to theirmeans certainly said captain malcolm povertyin itself is never despicable or ridiculousexcept to vulgar or thoughtless minds it isonly when it carries pretension along with itthat we feel privileged to laugh at so preposterousa union we are also apt to be moredisgusted with a coarse gourmand than with arefined epicure though there certainly is notmore moral or intellectual superiority evinced inthe love of turtle and venison or evenfricandeauand banquets than in cockyleeks and ducks oh how much i lament having lost thisday sighed lucy as she stopped her pony toadmire a lovely peep between the hills i fear your lost day is not to be understoodin the same sense as the emperor's was saidher father i suspect it is only your lostsketches you lamentlucy smiled as she acknowledged the feet but surely papa she added you mustdestiny allow it was rather harcl instead of roamingamongst rocks and glens and filling my portersfemme with sketches to be shut up all day withmr m'dow indeed papa his company isany thing but agreeable i am aware of that my dear but as a clergymani wish to show him au the respect inmy power his sacred office i consider thejlpo i which h b hengaged and the most difficult when one considerswhat various states of mind a faithfulpastor must be called upon to minister to but you surely cannot call him a faithfulpastor papa i cannot possibly conceive anyoneconsulting him about spiritual matters oreven asking him for a prayer i am sure i couldnot i never heard you so severe upon any onelucy when you have lived longer in theworld you will find there are worse charactersin the church than mr mdow thoughhappily there are also others whose geniuslearning and piety shed a lustre over the agein which they live mr m'dow is not an ixbstunrmont man otherwise i would not have gone tovisit hint the most offensive part of his character ithink said lucy next to his love of eatingis his constant jocularity not that i should hkea morose austere pastor who would look uponall gaiety as sin but i should like to see oneas cowper says serious in a serious cause i agree with you said her father thatwhen a clergyman views in its true light theimportance and the responsibility of the officehe has undertaken an office which as an oldwater says is a weight under which angels'shoulders might shrink his great object will beto get men to think seriously not to laugh lightlythough wit being a natural talent like everyother it may be turned to good accountah there is old sandy exclaimed lucyas a sudden turn of the road gave to

conversation with him for i finddestiny tmth pleasure and improvement in conversingwith him he is simple and artless but not vulgarfor he knows his bible and that trulymaketh wise the simple he is indeed a very favourable specimen ofhumble life said captain malcolm for ihave always found that where common educationis built on solid religious principles it neverfails to elevate the mind and give that contentedand independent spirit which is a nation's trueststrength and safety how perfectly he realizes grahame's pictureof a sabbath evening shepherd said lucystill gazing on the picturesque figure of her oldfavourite behold the man the grandsire and the saint his silvery locksbeam in the parting raj before him liesupon the smoothcropt sward the open bookhis comfort stay and ever new

scene the sun with all his retinue offlaming clouds sinking to rest in the bosom ofthe waterscaptain malcolm loved to encourage in hischildren a taste for the beauties of nature apleasure so cheap so pure and so elevating andhe readily assented to his daughter's requestseating themselves on a grassy spot by the sideof a wild mountain brook they gazed witheyes intent on the refulgent spectacle atlength lucy said how perfectly barton hasdestiny realized such an evening as this with all itsaccompanying feelings in that sweet poem ofhis morning and evening every verse seemsto me a perfect

when some one remarked to him thathe appeared to have caught cold he denied the bestirfact with much asperity then as if to givethe lie to the offensive insinuation he mountedhis horse and rode home ten miles in a pourof rain without greatcoat or umbrella thefollowing day he was still worse but neverthelessbeing in one of his invincible fits of illhumour and obstinacy he chose to stand out forsix

realizehe was beginning as usual one day withdestiny oh how i wish when his father gentlystopped himmy dear ronald said he i was in hopesyour good sense would before now have suggestedto you what a dangerous habit you areacquiring of constantly wishingdangerous papa repeated ronald howcan that possibly be i consider it very dangerous replied hisfather mildly and so will you i am verysure when you come to reflect upon it it ispositive waste of time and thought and contentmentwishing has been called the hectic of afool k it is not the proof of a dissatisfied mindwhich in your case i trust it is not it inevitablyleads to it for wishing is not very fourfrom murmuring it is not to inculcate an improvidenthabit but a contented mind that wearecharged to take no thought of tomorrowbut in my situation it is scarcely possibleto avoid wishing said ronald you surely do not mean to say it is scarcelypossible for you to avoid indulging in an idleand foolish habit said his father mildly we destinyhave indeed little controul over circumstances these are regulated by a higher power but asibilional and reflecting beings we are accountablefor the exercise of our facultiesbut my wishes are not so much for myselfas for others said ronald reddening a little atthe reproofi am aware of that my boy for yours isnot the sordid spirit that would merely seek itsown gratification but nevertheless you can dous no good by indulging those vain wishes ofyours perhaps eventually you could do usnone had you the power of gratifying them asit is very certain we know not the things thatare best for us and were our wishes granted itmight often be to our ruin one thing you maybeassured of your mother and i would rathersee you poor if possessed of a grateful heartand contented mind than master of

thedisquiet of riches without partaking of their enjoymentsthe news of his succession had spread fieand wide throughout the district but the particularswere as all particulars are very variouslyand

power than they did themselves he washeard with sorrowful incredulity or renewedentreaties that if he could not help them himdestinyself he woiild speak a word for them to thosewho could but ronald had already found ofwhat stuff messrs blanche snipes and lippewere made and that it was in vain to attemptto seek favour at their hands faithful to thetrust confided in them that of turning every

and knewwhat he was about the day he came here i sawthrough them even thenon my conscience i really believe sosaid benbowie i have no doubt it was these incendiariesthat were at the bottom of that insane proposalthe old scrivener made me about edith but iwould rather a thousand times have seen her inher grave than the wife of any beggarly tacksman'sson and to cut out her brother too well now is not that very curious saidmrs macauley are not these just the verywords that i heard mr reginald using the t'otherday edith says he i would rather see youkilled a thousand times than that you should havedisgraced yourself by marrying the tacksman'sson oh reginald said she you know that destinycould not be for i am engaged to be married toyou and so i would not marry ronald even ifhe were a king you'll really make these children as greatfools as you are yourself cried glenroy impatiently how can you put such nonsense intotheir heads me glenroy deed i never put any thinginto their heads i woidd be very sorry so farfrom that when the boys said that you hatedronald for he was a bad boy i said to themwell childer your papa may say what he pleasesand you ought to mind every thing he says whenit is good and fit to be remembered and whenhe happens to say what is maybe not just soright then you must be sure to forget iti really don't believe there is such anotherfool as yourself in

no doubt theywill be of use to me in the next worldthat's very true said benbowie wakingout of a doze on my conscience we shouldkeep all we cani don't believe there's a man on earth butmyself that

no power in me to hinder you well mydears i'm coming as another call from thechildren made her hasten to join them in a littleexcursion destinychapter xxvif it is difficult to impress truth upon theminds of children it must be owned there isnothing so easy as to instil prejudice lieeffect produced by these and similar invectiveswhich the young glenroys were in the dailyhabit of hearing may therefore be easily imaginedthe lochdhu family became graduallyassociated in their minds with every thing thatwas base and treacherous while ronald in particularwas the object of a sort of undefined illwill to the two boys who had already learnt toape the chieftain's tone and adopt his sentimentseven the gentle timid loving edith was insensiblyborne along in the stream she was stilltoo young to comprehend the nature of the caseor to conceive how pride prejudice and envymay distort the fairest and simplest statementdestiny neither could so monstrous a supposition everenter into her young imagination as that her papacould be in the wrong she could thereforeonly grieve in silence that her once dear friendsshould have been so wicked as to have told liesand cheated and that ronald dear ronald who had given her a white owl and was training a starling for her should have been such a badboy as to rob norman and to want to have herfor his wife when he was only a poor tacksman'sson and she was the daughter of the chiefsuch was the taint already communicated bypride and prejudice to the young and simpleheart by nature rich in love aiiid sweet humanitywith all glenroy's violence and fascinatinghe nevertheless did not proceed to open hostilitieswith the lochdhu family when they metwhich was but seldom he even felt his spirit sorebuked beneath the mild and unassuming yetopen and fearless aspect of captain malcolmthat his blustering subsided into a dead calm ormerely showed itself in a still haughtier deportment his kinsman was at no loss to guess that destinythis accession of dignity in his manner was occasionedby anger and disappointment and he wasaware how unavailing argument or expostulationwould be against prejudice so unreasonable andinveterate he also knew that offended prideis only to be propitiated by the humiliation ofthe object of offence to attempt therefore toconciliate the chief on the footing of equalityhe perceived would only exasperate him themore and as there was nothing on his part whichcalled for concession he deemed it the wisestplan to allow matters to take their course withouteither seeking or avoiding an explanationalthough captain and mrs malcolm were notso utopian as to attempt to bring up their childrenin utter ignorance of the wickedness of theworld in general still less eie they given topoint out particular living instances of it as theyfound quite enough on record to serve theirpurpose without applying the scalpel to thecharacters of all their acquaintances glenroy'sbehaviour therefore called forth no animadversionsfrom them in presence of their familythey knew that reason and the improvementdestiny of the understanding nay religion itself areoften insufficient to destroy prejudices imbibedin early life and that children cannot possiblydiscriminate or comprehend the vast variety ofshades which are to be found in the same characterwith them every thing and everybodyis either good or bad and of course eitherloved or hated with all the ardour of unregulatedminds they were therefore unwilling to impresstheir young hearts with feelings of enmityand aversion against one who with all his pridevanity and littleness of mind nevertheless possessedclaims upon their forbearance and goodwillsome childish disorder which showed itself inthe family soon afforded a plausible excuse forthe continued estrangement and captain malcolmtrusted that by the time that was over thechieftain's disappointment would be somewhatmollified and so it gradually was in somedegree although for want of something

drowning boy and then to wake tosilence and sad conviction that all was not adream but prayer would again bring downits holy calm to tha troubled mind and the piousmourner would meekly confess that it was goodfor her to be thus brought even by the hand ofsorrow to the throne of grace it was at thistime that a visit from the good mr stuart cameto cheer and invigorate her drooping spirithe was a man whose whole appearance anddestiny deportment were so emblematic of the sanctityof his character that even a child would havefelt that there was a holy man he was of a palethoughtful cast of countenance but his thoughtswere evidently such as savoured more of heavenlythings than lowborn cares for its expressionwas at once elevated and benign hebore his great commission in his lookand the sense of that sacred trust gave a certaindignified humility to the apostolic simplicity ofhis demeanourit is difficult to describe a piety so consistentin all its parts and so unvarying in its practicewhich sheds a living fiction over the wholecharacter whose influence is deeply felt in thedaily intercourse of life but whose results donot dazzle by any sudden or powerful impressionhuman life indeed is composed of such anunceasing succession of minute occurrences andhumble duties and undignified occupations thatit would seem tedious and trivial to narrate thecourse of even a good

was with the venerablepastor of auchnagoil grandeur worldly grandeurwould have heard with a disdainful smilethe simple annals of his obscure life but howmuch of moral grandeur was there in the selfimmolationof his christian course a course atonce humble and sublime he was indeed a living sermon of the truths he taught and toinculcate these truths by precept and examplewas the sole aim of his consecrated office tosuccour the distressed to minister to the sick tahelp the poor to comfort the mourner to cheerthe penitent to reclaim the wanderer for thishe laboured in the farextended district wudihis parish contained for this he visited the diitant village and the lonely hut seeking out eachindividual of his widelyscattered flock for thishe braved the winter's flood and summer's heatfor this he crossed many a rough and tempestuousferry and climbed many a rugged and drearymountain and traversed many an unfrequentedglendestiny et would not grace one spark of pride allowor cry

ownestimation how differently did he view it unworthyand unprofitable servant that i am hewould exclaim to himself how mixed are allmy motives how selfish are my best intentions how polluted my purest affections howdeficient are my best works but thou hast toldthe weary troubled soul to come unto thee andthou wilt give it peace peace how differentand how superior to the outward satisfaction ofthe vain selfsatisfied worldly mind such are the feelings of the true christianhis warfare is within and in proportion as he detintis enabled by the eye of sith to discern theholiness and purity of god so shall he alsoperceive the guilt and frailty of his own imperfectnaturehe spoke and his words came like balm tothe wounded hearts of the sorrowing parentsfor they came fraught with cheering promisesand glorious hopes of eternal life he hadethem turn their thoughts from the contemplationof that on which at such a time our thoughtsalas are too prone to dwell even the materialpart of that immortal being once so precious inour sighthe had known ronald and he knew the goodseed that had been sown in his young heart andfelt convinced that in the hour of peril thatwould not have failed himi am far from saying that you ought not toweep for him you have lost said the good pastorwhile his own eyes were moistened with sorrowsuch a state even if attainable would be ferfrom desirable it would defeat the purpose forwhich god hath been pleased to bestow upon usidestiny warm and kindly affections we know thatafflictions are sent not as punishments but asmessengers of love to lead us unto himi feel it is so said mrs malcolm meekly but still my rebellious heart she stoppedbut struggling to overcome her emotionadded alas i often think had my boy butdied in my arms i could have yielded him upwith less reluctance to the will of god i feelas if i could then have said with greater sinceritythan i fear i do now the lord gaveand the lord hath taken away blessed be thename of the lord that is a natural feeling said mr stuart the horrors of death always come aggravatedto our minds when accompanied as in this casewith any thing of suddenness or mystery wearethen apt to imagine it more dreadful thanany reality forgetting that the lord is mightierthan the noise of many waters yea than thewaves of the sea true the silver cord isloosened and the golden bowl is broken andthe dust has returned to the dust but the spirit destinythas also returned to grot who gave it whatmatters it then how we enter on the valley ofthe shadow of death when we know we are topass through it by the light of those divine footstepswhich have trod it before us they stillremain and will remain till time shall be nomore to guide us to our heavenly home wherethis corruptible shall put on incorruption andthis mortal shall be clothed with immortality where we shall enter on glory such as eye hathnot seen nor ear heard and which it hath notentered into the heart of man to conceive with such glorious prospects of perfect andendless felicity at the end of the christian coursesaid captain malcolm it indeed matters littlewhether we enter upon them by lingering decayor by a stroke of the sword orthe shock ofa wave whichever it is we must believe that itis the means our heavenly father deemed thebest and in that belief let us humbly acquiesce and in that simple act of acquiescence weshall feel a sure and certain rest for our soulssaid mr stuart time it has been truly saidindeed obliterates sorrow from the worldlydestine heart and leaves it no better than it found it but religion beautifies and sanctifies afflictionin the heart of the christian and causes it evento bring forth new and more abundant graces the fountain of bitter water may yet become thewell of living water springing up to everlastinglife feeling and acknowledging as i do thetruth of these things said mrs malcolm howweak how sinful it seems to allow my soul tobe thus cast down i know the conditions onwhich every blessing is bestowed that we mustone day part with it sand i believe that godknows best when that parting should be andyet she added while the tears flowed silentlydown her cheek my son my son do not judge yourself thus strictly saidthe good pastor you do not mourn as thosewho have no hope the spirit is willing tobelieve all things though the flesh is weak toendure them you believe that god gives

requisites sufficient to ensure hispopularity as a future chief had it beenpossible for him to have been eclipsed in hisfather's eyes or house he certainly would havebeen so by his cousin reginald who

richer and nobler stamp than norman'she had good feelings great sensibility an destinydent romantic imagination and a highspiritedscorn of every thing mean and base and although he was at the same time headstrong selfwilledand impetuous the slave of impulse andthe sport of passion yet as his impulse oftenled him to what was good and his passion was amere gust these in early life showed scarcely asdefects but seemed merely the natural exuberanceof youthful blood and unchecked spiritsthe seeds of many good qualities had beensown in him by nature but not much had beendone by education to bring them to maturity the tares had been suffered to grow up with thewheat and both were now so completely blendedtogether that it would have required no commonskill and pains to have distinguished

young men tofinish their studies at an english universitybut his remonstrances were always answered bya quotation from dr johnson the only one thechief had ever burdened his memory with that an english education could only tame a highlandchieftain into insignificance andi nestivyair my son shall not be tamed into insignificancei any of your english universities'mr ellis was therefore obliged t give up thepoint and having written on die subject to sirangus he only waited to receive his instructionsas to the future plans to be adopted for thecompleting of ronald's education bdtore hetook leave of his pupils and relinquished whatwas now a mere nominal office that of theirpreceptorglenroy liked his daughter as well as he couldlike any thing incapable of holding or transmittingthe chieftainship yet still she was rather aninsignificant person in his estimation he washowever pleased to hear on all hands that edithwas reckoned the prettiest girl in the countyand that reginald and she had already formedan attachment to each other as that was atonce securing a good establishment for her andsaving himself all trouble as to her future disposalalthough it has been said the love whichgrows by degrees is more nearly allied to friendshipthan to passion nevertheless the attachmentof the cousins seemed to form an exceptiondestiny to this general rule for their love had continuedto grow with their growth and strengthen withtheir strengthas the attachment was sanctioned by bothsides of the house the course of their love conrtray to that of all other loves seemed destinedto run in a very smooth channel and it wasalready settled that the marriage should takeplace upon reginald's attaining the age of twentyone no envious cloud therefore marredthe brightness of their horizon they stood onthe threshold of life and all life's fairestprospects lay spread out before thema too strict similarity of character is perhapsnot favourable either to love or friendship andthe difference of dispositions in the young loversseemed only such as would give greater charm totheir attachment reginald was all fire and impetuositywhile edith was all gentleness andtimidity

should yield to the dominion of an artlessaffection unsullied by the tarnish of the worldand live in a creation of her own outwardlycalm and serene all the powers of her mindwere concentrated in those feelings which hiddenfrom the common eye had entwined themselveswith every fibre of her heart and choked eachplant of humble wholesome influenceher mind though sensitive and feminine wasnaturally strong but it was relaxed and enfeebledfrom the constant habit of looking to reginaldas the ruler and arbiter of her verythoughts the materials of excellence and happinesshad been largely bestowed

hertrust and there sought her abiding place of restand refuge dxtiktchapter xxxione of the many gifts mrs macauley hadreceived from nature was her feteulty of dreamingwhich she piqued herself upon in no smalldegree and although it never had been productiveof any good either to herself or othersyet she nevertheless entertained the utmostrespect and veneration for this endowment andplaced the most perfect reliance on her ownoraclesglenroy of course affected to treat her dreamsand visions as he did herself with great contemptbut secretly he had rather a relish forthem especially as mrs macauley was not apublic dreamer her dreams always related tohis house and family and there was therefore asort of importance annexed to the idea of havinghis own peculiar dreamer in his household itwas a piece of state almost equal to that of keepdestinying a dwarf or a fool or a henchman or a piperor any other of those prerogatives of grandeurthe natural contempt however which is feltin this enlightened age for old wives dreams andeven for young women's fables together with theprofound respect we entertain for the understandingof our readers withholds us from relatingupon this occasion the cabalistic narrative withwhich mrs macauley one morning regaled thebreakfast table suffice it to say it was all adream should or could be it was grand confuseddark incoherent contradictory senselessand sublime and in spite of the ludicrous tonesand gestures of the narrator it produced moreor less an impression upon the minds of heraudience from the cloud of her misty imaginationvarious distinct images emerged therewas a large raven with a wedding ring in itsmouth there was a troubled sea and a dovewith a bleeding breast there was a shroudtwo coffins and a grave and there was the ministermr m'dow all dressed in white standingin the kirk with miss edith who was all dressedin black and somebody else with such a mist destinyupon them she could not make out who it wasc c ca few days after this memorable dream therearrived accounts of the death of sir angus malcolmhe had died of the fever of the countryjust as he was on the point of embarking forbritain he had had sufficient warning of hisdanger however to admit of his making arrangementsas to the management of his affairs andthe disposal of his on sir angus seemed tohave felt that reginald had been left too long toglenroy's superintendence for he directed thathe should as soon as possible be entered at oneof the english universities under the superintendenceof mr ellis after spending two yearsat college he was to set out on a tour to thecontinent accompanied by mr ellis to remainabroad until he came of age he was then toreturn home and celebrate the event among hisown people in a manner befitting the heir ofan ancient house and noble property a sanctionwas given to his marriage with edith and ahope expressed that he would then settle for lifein his own countrydestiny o what a mercer it is i had

style of colloquy held by thesetwo worthy gentlemen and had reginald beeninclined to disregard his father's dying injunctionsplausible pretexts would not have beenwanting for him to have at least postponed thefulfilling of them but reginald was eager toenter upon the course pointed out to him andmr ellis lost no time in taking the necessarysteps for getting him entered at oxford whitherhe was to accompany him nothing could induceglenroy to part with norman and as normanattached no great ideas of pleasure to a destinystudent's life he was easily prevailed upon torelinquish it and to remain at home his ownmaster so called though still more the masterof all around himedith beheld with meek and silent sorrow thetime approach for the departure of reginaldto be separated from him for more than a fewdays was an evil she had never contemplatedand now weeks and months were to drag theirslow course along while reginald and she wereto dwell apart oh what a solitude would hersbe the dreariest the saddest of all solitudes thesolitude of the heartreginald's sorrow at parting with edith itmight be supposed was pretty much swallowedup in the anticipated novelty and variety thatawaited him and he strove to comfort and erassure her as he talked cheerfully of the shortnessof the time of his probation three yearswere nothing besides he should certainly makea point of seeing her often again before he leftengland and at any rate he should write to herconstantly every day that she might never forasingle day forget him he would then ritesrate his own vows of eternal love and constancyand call upon edith to repeat the same whileeach favourite haunt was visited and hallowed intheir imaginations by the pensive thought thatit would be long ere they should again revisitthem together thus the intervening days glidedaway with the rapidity of a stream and thusfeeling stamped the value of ages upon theduration of moments then swiftly came theparting hour that hourwhen love first feels its own overwhelming powerthis edith is a ring of betrothment saidreginald as he placed one upon her fingerremember there it must remain till i exchangeit for a bridal one edith do you promiseand he held her hand locked in his while edithtried to smile an affirmative through her partingtearsagain and again the farewell was spokensain and again edith was pressed to his heartand now he was gone and she was left alone destinychapter xxxiiby degrees the loss of reginald's society wasalmost atoned for to edith by the new enjoymentof corresponding with him it was a differenta more abstracted and concentrated feelingbut scarcely a less delightful one than thatwhich she used to enjoy in his presence truehe was no longer with her but then whatthough the image itself was gone the impressionremained almost as vivid as the reality andshe had his ring his picture his letters thosemute but eloquent pledges of his faith thealmost daily assurances of his love the oftrepeatedvows the fond anticipations of theirfuture happiness deep and earnest in her lovebut timid and reserved in her manners herheart expatiated more freely upon paper thandestiny ever it had done in the daily intercourse of herwhole life so that she was ready to exclaim o fortune thou canst not divideour bodies so but that our hearts are tied and we can love by letters still and giftsand thoughts and dreamsthus was her mind kept in a state of constantexcitement more inimical to its repose thanthe presence even of the object of her affectionimagination left to itself had awakened in herthat extreme sensibility so destructive to happinesswhich in seeming to give us a sweetexistence in another's being is only fixing morefirmly its barbed arrow in the heartso passed days weeks and months and whenthe college vacations permitted reginald revisitedwith delight his early home absence sofarfrom abating the attachment of the youthfullovers seemed if possible to have augmented itand the lapse of time had only added new attractionsto each in the eyes of the otherbut now a longer period of absence was tointervene and seas were to divide them the destinytime for reginald's visit to the continent hadarrived and painful was the parting of the loversyet the sanguine spirit of reginald impartedcomfort to edith as he fondly reminded her thattwo out of the three years of their probation wereover and that this parting should be the lastmany was the fond and impassioned lettershe received from reginald and many were thetender and confiding ones she wrote in replyat length his letters became less frequent butthat was not surprising considering that he wasconstantly moving from one place to another andthen when they did come they were as affectionateas ever he still reminded edith of theirengagement she still assured her that time andabsence only rendered her dearer to him andthat he longed impatiently for the time when hewas to return to her to part no more but afterreceiving one of those letters breathing all that afond lover could say to the idol of his heai't a longpause ensued and then when the next cameedith thought but it must be fancy that thestyle was changed it was short too but hepleaded a headach perhaps he was ill and condestinyceased it from her and many an anxious day andsleepless night she passed till another arrived itwas still shorter but he was just setting out uponan excursion and had not time to write more thanamere line to assure dear edith he was wellother long and dreary chasms ensued and werebut faintly attempted to be filled up by meagreletters full of little else than apologies for theirrarity and promises of writing oftener and longerones but the same excuses continued onetime the heat was so excessive he could scarcelyhold the pen then he was interrupted by afriend or he was just returned from a fatiguingexcursion or he was setting out upon a pleasuretour or the time was now drawing near whenhe should be returning to scotland and thereforeit was unnecessary to say much more at presentso absorbed was edith in anxiety about reginaldthat she was quite unconscious of the attentionsor rather intentions of another lover inthe person of the young lord alloy who frompartaking occasionally of glenroy's hospitalitieshad now become a more frequent visitor andhaving no small opinion of himself he concludedhe had only to pay his addresses to have them destinyinstantly accepted edith's ideas of love weremuch too romantic to enable her to construe theflimsy gallantry of a modem fine gentleman intoany thing like a serious passion and her surpriseat his lordship's hasty and selfassured proposalscould only be surpassed by his amazement at therejection of his suit it was one that in othercircumstances glenroy would have been gratifiedwith but as edith was engaged to reginaldhe could only have the satisfaction of chucklingover it in private or throwing out innuendoes inpublicthus wore away time but still reginald camenot and his birthday the day of his coming ofage which his father had recommended him tocelebrate at home among his own people thatday which he himself had so fondly anticipatedand which edith had looked forward to with nocommon interest that day passed unnoticedunheeded on his part and on hers only recordedas a day of disappointment and gloomglenroy chafed and fumed at this

had heard andread of such a thing as inconstancy but to associateit with the idea of reginald never enteredher imagination or if it did it was instantly dismissedshe had only to recall the

sorrow hath beenvol o bestiitkchapter xxxiiiyears had passed away since ronald malcolmhad left his native home when one bightsummer's day a tall and smibumt youth coarselyand scantily clad but with something wildand noble in his air and aspect stood on theshores of lochdhu and for a moment surveyedits dark mountains and roaring waters with thelook of one to whom they bore no onioninterestthat youth was ronald and many a sad sighthis young eyes had looked upon since last he leftthe spot where he now stood and many astrange and moving accident burned within himto relate to the dear ones he had left he hadto tell of the wonders of the raging sea and theangry heavens which had shivered the statelyship and sink so many high hearts and bravedestiny beneath the devouring billows he had to tellof his own escape with others of the gallant crewand of the hunger the thirst the cold the heatthe hardships and privations they had enduredand under which many of those brave spirits hadsunk he had to tell of the survivors reachingthe coast of africa only to become captives tothe wild and lawless natives by whom they weredriven as slaves to the interior of those wild desertand unexplored regions where his companionsone by one fell victims to the severity of theirlot but his youth and dauntless spirit his habitsof endurance and activity the flexibility andsweetness of his temper had under the blessingof a superintending providence enabled him tobear the heavy load assigned him and had evengained him favour in the eyes of his barbarouscaptors how many a summer's day and winter'snight would it take to tell of all that he had seenand thought and felt and suffered and doneduring his dreary captivity and how even in thedepths of his desolation he had ever cherishedthat trust divine which a mother's lips had earlybreathed into his infant soul then came his destinyescape with all its dangers and privations hiswanderings by land his perils by sea all theseand much more had ronald to tell but all wasforgotten in the tumult of his feelings as he stoodonce more on his native shore and looked on hisfather's house and recalled the dear familiarscenes of his childhoodmemory flew over the intervening years and faded from his mind save the loved oneswhose looks and tones had sometimes hauntedhis very heart to agony as fancy pictured thejoys of home to the

waspressed to a mother's beating heart all thesethoughts rushed through the yoimg adventurer'smind as he gazed for a moment on the wellrememberedfeatures of his mountain homethese were unchanged for

conjecture or to fear but in an instant he wasat the house this father's house he had crossedthe threshold of his oncehappy home but stillthere was none to meet him none to welcomehim every thing was displaced and in disorderand he sought in several of the rooms beforehe discovered an old purblind woman whoseemed the sole inhabitant of the house he hadleft so full of life and joy and youth

voice choking with agitationhe enquired for captain malcolm for theemily but he had to repeat the question threetimes before he could obtain an answer forthough not positively deaf her ear was slow
