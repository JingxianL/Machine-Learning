then the oldman opened the scroll and he taught the infantsto repeat after him that beautiful prayer which westill dedicate to the lord and still teach to ourchildren and then he told them in simple phraseof god's love to the young and how not a sparrowfalls but his eye sees it this lovely custom ofinfant initiation was long cherished by the earlychurch in memory of the words which saidsuffer the little children to come unto me andforbid them not and was perhaps the origin ofthe superstitious calumny which ascribed to thenazarenes the crime which the nazarene when victoriousattributed to the jew viz the decoyingchildren to hideous rites at which they were secretlyimmolatedand the stern paternal penitent seemed to feelin the innocence of his children a return into earlylife life ere yet it

thoughts far down the stream of time they laid out the chart of their destiny to come they suffered the light of today to suffuse themorrow in the youth of their hearts it seemedas if care and cluuig and death were as thingsunknown perhaps they loved each other thepompeii more because the condition of the work left toglaucus no aim and no wish but love becausethe distractions common in free states to menesaffection existed not for the athenian becausehis country wooed him not to the bustle of civillife because ambition furnished no counterpoiseto love and therefore over their schemes andtheir

wished to attendher with the slender staff by which she guidedher steps she went now as in her former unprotectedstate along the populous streets it wasalmost miraculous to perceive how quickly andhow dexterously she threaded every crowd avoidedevery danger and could find her benightedway through the most intricate windings of thecity but her chief delight was still in visitingthe few feet of ground which made the garden ofglaucus in tending the flowers that at least repayedher love sometimes she entered the chnmpompeii ber where he sat and sought a conversationwhich she nearly always broke off abruptly forconversation with glaucus only tended to onesubject lone and that name from his lips inflictedagony upon her often she bitterly repentedthe service she had rendered to lone

unscathed had ripened her passionsthough they had not sullied her purity the orgiesof turbo might only have disgusted the banquets ofthe egyptian might only have terrified at the moment but perhaps those winds of pollution left seedsin the breast over which they passed so lightly asdarkness too favours the imagination so perhapsher very blindness contributed to feed aith avildand delirious visions the love of the unfortunategirl the voice of glaucus had been the fiist thathad sounded musically to her ear his kindnessmade a deep impression upon her mind when hepompeii had left pompeii iu the former year she had treasuredup in her heart every word he had utteredand when any one told her that this friend andpatron of the poor flower girl was the most brilliantand the most graceful of the young revellersof pompeii she had felt a pleasing pride in nursinghis recollection even the task which sheimposed upon herself of tending his flowers servedto keep him in her mind she associated him withallthat was most charming to her impressions andwhen she had refused to express what image shefancied lone to resemble it was partly perhapsthat whatever was bright and soft in nature shehad already combined with the thought of glaucusif any of my readers ever loved at an age whichthey would now smile to remember an age inwhich fancy forestalled the reason let them saywhether that love among all its strange and complicateddelicacies was not above all other andlater passions susceptible of jealousy seeknot here the cause i know that it is commonlythe factwhen glaucus returned to pompeii nydiahad told another year of life that year with itsthe last days ofsorrows its loneliness its trials had greatlydeveloped her mind and heart and when theathenian drew her unconsciously to his breastdeeming her still in soul as in years a child when he kissed her smooth cheek and wound hisarm round her trembling frame nydia felt suddenlyand as by revelation that those feelingsshe had long and innocently cherished were oflove doomed to be rescued from tyranny byglaucus doomed to take shelter under his roof doomed to breathe but for so brief a time the sameair and doomed in the first rush of a thousandhappy grateful delicious sentiments of an overflowingheart to hear that he loved another tobe commissioned to that other the messengerthe minister to feel all at once that utter nothingnesswhich she was which she ever mustbe but which till then her young mind had nottaught her that utter nothingness to him whowas all to her what wonder that in her wildand passionate soul all the elements jarred discordant that if love reigned over the whole itwas not the love which is born of the more sacredpompeii and soft emotions sometimes she dreaded onlylest glaucus should discover her secret sometimesshe felt indignant that it was not suspected it was a sign of contempt could he imaginethat she presumed so far her feelings to loneebbed and flowed with every hour now sheloved her because he did now she hated herfor the same cause there were moments whenshe could have murdered her unconscious mistressmoments when she could have laid down life forher these fierce

is one of the most considerablein point of size of any yet discoveredat pompeii and is moreover built much accordingto the specific instructions for a suburbanvilla laid down by the roman architect it maynot be uninteresting briefly to describe the plan ofthe apartments through which our visitors passedthey entered then by the same small vestibuleat which we have before been presented to theaged medon and passed at once into a colonnadetechnically termed the peristyle for the maindifference between the suburban villa and the the last days oftown mansion consisted in placing in the firstthe said colonnade in exactly the same placeas that which in the town mansion was occupiedby the atrium in the centre of the peristylewas an ojien court which contained the from this peristyle descended a staircase to theoffices another narrow passage on the oppositeside communicated with a garden various smallapartments surrounded the colonnade appropriatedprobably to country visitors another door to

game too muchin earnestthey are worthy of a mitre replied julia indisdainmitres were worn sometimes by men and considered a greatmark of effeminacy to be fit for a mitre was therefore to be fitfor very little else it is astonishing how many modern opinionsare derived from antiquity doubtless it was this classical notionof mitres that incited the ardour of mr ripon to expel thebishops there is a vast deal of wickedness in latin pompeii oh have you seen the new house of fulviusthe dear poet said pansa's wifeno is it handsome very such good taste but they say my dearthat he has such improper

of places to eachguestthe reader understands that the festive board wascomposed of three tables one at the centre andone at each wing it was only at the outer side ofthese tables that the guests reclined the inner spacewas left untenanted for the greater convenience ofthe waiters or ministry the extreme corner of oneof the wings was appropriated to julia as the ladyof the feast that next her

was not a little puzzled as to his electionthe invalid senator was too grave and too infirmfor the proper fulfilment of his duty the aedilepansa was adequate enough to the task but thento choose the

his breastapsecides fell to the ground pierced to the hearthe fell mute without even a groan at the verybase of the sacred chapelarbaces gazed upon him for a moment with thefierce animal joy of conquest over a foe but pressthe last days ofgently the full sense of the clanger to avliich he wasexposed flashed upon him he wiped his weaponcarefully in the long giass and with the very garmentsof his victim drew his cloak round him andwas about to depart when he saw coming up thepath right before him the figure of a young manwhose steps reeled and vacillated strangely as headvanced the quiet moonlight streamed full uponhis face which seemed by the whitening ray colourlessas marble the egyptian recognised theface and form of glaucus the unfortunate andbenighted greek was chanting a disconnectedand mad song composed from snatches ofhymns and sacred odes all jarringly woven togetherha thought the egyptian instantaneouslydivining his state and its terrible cause so thenthe helldraught works and destiny hath sent theehither to crush two of my foes at once quickly even ere this thought occurred to himhe had withdrawn on one side of the chapel andconcealed himself amongst the boughs from thatlurkingplace he watched as a tiger in its lairpompeii the advance of his second victim he noted thewandering and restless fire in the bright and beautifuleyes of the athenian the convulsions that distortedhis statuelike features and writhed his huelesslip he saw that the greek was utterly deprivedof reason nevertheless as glaucus came up to thedead body of appetites from which the dark redstream flowed slowly over the grass so strangeand ghastly a spectacle could not fail to arrest himbenighted and erring as was his glimmering sensehe paused placed his hand to his brow as if tocollect himself and then saying what ho endymion steepest thou so soundly what has the moon said to thee thou makesme jealous it is time to wake he stooped downwith the intention of lifting up the bodyforgetting feeling not his own debility tkeegyptian sprung from his hidingplace and as thegreek bent struck him forcibly to the groundover the very body of the christian then raisinghis powerful voice to its loudest pitch heshouted ho citizens ho help me run hither the last days ofhither a murder a murder before your veryfane help or the murderer escapes as hespoke he placed his foot on the breast of glaucusan idle and superfluous precaution for the potionoperating with the fall the greek lay theremotionless and insensible save that now andthen his lips gave vent to some vague and ravingsoundsas he there stood awaiting the coming of thosehis voice still continued to summon perhaps someremorse some compunctious visiting for despitehis crimes he was human haunted the breast ofthe egyptian the defenceless state of glaucus his wandering words his riven reason smote himeven more than the death of appetites and he saidhalf audibly to himself poor clay poor human reason where is thesoul now i could spare thee o my rival rivalnever more but destiny must be obeyed my safetydemands thy sacrifice with that as if to drowncompunction he shouted yet more loudly anddrawing from the girdle of glaucus the stilus itcontained he steeped it in the blood of the murderedman and laid it beside the corpsepompeii and now fast and breathless several of thecitizens came thronging to the place some withtorches which the moon rendered unnecessarybut which flared red and tremulously against thedarkness of the trees they surrounded thespotlift up yon corpse said the egyptian andguard well the murdererthey raised the body and great was theirhorror and sacred indignation to discover in thatlifeless clay a priest of the adored and venerableisis but still greater perhaps was their surprisewhen they found the accused in the brilliant andadmired athenianglaucus cried the bystanders with oneaccord is it even credible i would sooner whispered one man to hisneighbors believe it to
