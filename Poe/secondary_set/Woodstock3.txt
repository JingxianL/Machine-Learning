remainingwith your sword drawn where it is myduty to see peace observed i obey you sir henry said the kingsheathing his rapier i hardly indeed knowwherefore i was assaulted by this gentlemani assure you none respects the king's person orprivileges more than thyself though the devotionis somewhat out of fashion woodstockwe may find a place to meet sir repliedeverard where neither the royal person norprivileges can be offendedfaith very hardly sir said charles unableto suppress the rising jest i mean theking has so few followers that the loss of theleast of them might be some small damage to himbut risking all that i will meet you whereverthere is fair field for a poor cavalier to get off insafety if he has the luck in fightsir henry lee's first idea had been fixed uponthe insult offered to the royal demesne he nowbegan to turn them towards the safety of hiskinsman and of the young royalist as he deemedhim gentlemen he said i must insist onthis business being put to a final end nephewmarkham is this your return for my condescensionin coming back to woodstock on your warrantthat you should take an opportunity to cutthe throat of my guest if you knew his purpose as well as i do said markham and then paused conscious thathe might only incense his uncle without convincinghim as anything he might say of kerneguy'swoodstock addresses to alice was like to be imputed to hisown jealous suspicions he looked on the groundtherefore and was silentand you master kerneguysaid sir henrycan you give me any reason why you seek totake the use of this young man in whom thoughunhappily forgetful of his loyalty and duty imust yet take some interest as my nephew byaffinity i was not aware the gentleman enjoyed thathonour which certainly would have protectedhim from my sword answered kerneguy butthe quarrel is his nor can i tell any reason whyhe fixed it upon me unless it were the differenceof our political opinionsyou know the contrary said everardyou know that i told you you were safe fromme as a fugitive royalist and your last wordsshowed you were at no loss to guess my connexionwith sir henry that indeed is of littleconsequence i should debase myself did i usethe relationship as a means of protection fromyou or any oneas they thus disputed neither choosing to woodstockproach the real cause of quarrel sir henry lookedfrom the one to the other with a peacemakingcountenance exclaiming why what an intricate impeach is this i think you both have drunk of circe's cupcome my young masters allow an old man tomediate between you i am not shortsighted insuch matters the mother of mischief is no biggerthan a gnat's wing and i have known fiftyinstances in my own day when as will saysgallants have been confronted hardilyin single opposition hand to handin which after the field was fought no one couldremember the cause of quarrel tush a smallthing will do it the taking of the wall or thegentle rub of the shoulder in passing each otheror a hasty word or a misconceived gesturecomeforget your cause of quarrel be what it willyou have had your breathing and though youput up your rapiers unbodied that was no defaultof yours but by command of your elderand one who had right to use authority in maltawhere the duello is punctiliously well understoodthe persons engaged in a single combatwooustock are bound to halt on the command of a knightor priest or lady and the quarrel so interruptedis held as honourably terminated and may notbe revived nephew it is i think impossiblethat you can nourish spleen against this younggentleman for having fought for his king hearmy honest proposal markham you know ibear no malice though i have some reason to beoffended with you give the young man yourhand in friendship and we will back to thelodge all three together and drink a cup ofsack in token of reconciliationsmarkham everard found himself unable toresist this approach towards kindness on his uncle'spart he suspected indeed what was partlythe truth that it was not entirely from revivinggood will but also that his uncle thoughtby such attention to secure his neutrality at leastif not his assistance for the safety of the fugitiveroyalist he was sensible that he was placed inan awkward predicament and that he might incurthe suspicions of his own party for holdingintercourse even with a near relation who harbouredsuch guests but on the other hand hethought his services to the commonwealth had woodstock been of sufficient importance to outweigh whateverenvy might urge on that topic indeed althoughthe civil war had divided families muchand in many various ways yet when it seemedended by the triumph of the republicans therage of political hatred began to relent and theancient ties of kindred and friendship regained atleast a part of their former influence many reunionswere formed and those who like everardadhered to the conquering party often exertedthemselves for the protection of then desertedrelativesas these things rushed through his mind accompaniedwith the prospect of a renewed intercoursewith alice lee by means of which hemight be at hand to protect her against everychance either of injury or insult he held out hishand to the supposed scottish page saying atthe same time that for his part he was veryready to forget the cause of quarrel or rather toconsider it as arising out of a misapprehensionand to offer master kerneguy such friendship asmight exist between honourable men who hadembraced different sides in politicsunable to overcome the feeling of personalwoodstock dignity which prudence recommended to himto forget louis kerneguy in return bowed lowbut without accepting everard's proffered hand he had no occasion he said to make anyexertions to forget the cause of quarrel for hehad never been able to comprehend it but ashehad not shunned the gentleman's resentmentso he was now willing to embrace and return anydegree of his favour with which he might bepleased to honour himeverard withdrew his hand with a smile andbowed in return to the salutation of the pagewhose stiff reception of his advances he imputedto the proud pettish disposition of a scotch boytrained up in ideas of family consequence andpersonal importance which his acquaintance withthe world had not yet been sufficient to dispelsir henry lee delighted with the terminationof the quarrel which he supposed to be indeep deference to his own authority and not displeasedwith the opportunity of renewing someacquaintance with his nephew who had notwithstandinghis political demerits a warmer interestin his affections than he was perhaps himselfaware of said in a tone of consolation neverwoodstockbe mortified young gentlemen i protest it wentto my heart to part you when i saw you stretchingyourselves so handsomely and in fair love ofhonour without any malicious or bloodthirstythoughts i promise you had it not been formy duty as ranger here and sworn to the officei would rather have been your umpire thanyour hindrance but a finished quarrel is aforgotten quarrel and your tilting should haveno further consequence excepting the appetite itmay have given youso saying he mounted his pony and movedforward in

the ridicule being greatly enhanced by thedisproportion of size betwixt the animal and itsriderperhaps the knight saw their wonder for thefirst words he said after they left the groundwere pixie

scot completingthe sentence which the good knight had leftunfinished ay still surviveto witch the world with noble horsemanship everard coloured for he felt the irony butnot so his uncle whose simple vanity never permittedhim to doubt the sincerity of the complimentare you advised of that he said in kingjames's time indeed i have appeared in thetiltyard and there you might have said you saw young harry with his beaver upas to seeing old harry why here theknight paused and looked as a bashful man inlabour of a pun as to old harry why youmight as well see the devil you take me masterkerneguy the devil you know is my namesakeha ha ha cousin everard i hope yourprecision is not startled by an innocent jest he was so delighted with the applause of bothhis companions that he recited the whole of thecelebrated passage referred to and concluded woodstockwith defying the present age bundle all its witsdonne cowley waller and the rest of them togetherto produce a poet of a tenth part of thegenius of old willwhy we are said to have one of his descendantsamong us sir william d'avenantsaid louis kerneguy and many think him asclever a fellowwhat exclaimed sir henry willdavenant whom i knew in the north an officerunder newcastle when the marquis lay beforehull why he was an honest cavalier and ivrotegood doggrel enough but how came he akin towill shakspeare i trow why replied the young scot by thesurer side of the house and after the old fashionif davenant speaks truth it seems that hismother was a goodlooking laughing buxommistress of an inn between stratford and londonat which will shakspeare often quarteredas he went down to his native town and that outof friendship and gossipred as we say in scotlandwill shakspeare became godfather to willd'avcnant and not contented with this spiritualwoodstock activity the younger will is for establishing someclaim to a natural one alleging that his motherwas a great admirer of wit and there were nobounds to her complaisance for men of geniusout upon the hound said colonel everard would he purchase the reputation of descendingfrom poet or from prince at the expenseof his mother's good fame this nose ought tobe slitthat would be difficult answered the disguisedprince recollecting the peculiarity of thebard's countenancewill d'avenant the son of will shakspeare said the knight who had not yet recoveredhis surprise at the enormity of the pretension why it reminds me of a verse in the of phaeton where the hero complainsto his mother besides by all the village boys i am shamedyou the sun's son you rascal you be d ed we observe this couplet in fielding's farce of tumbledowndick founded on the same classical story as it was current inthe time of the commonwealth it must have reached the authorof tom jones by tradition for no one will suspect the presentauthor of making the anachronismvol iii b woodstocki never heard such unblushing assurance in mylife swill d'avenant the son of the brightestand best poet that ever was is or will be buti crave your pardon nephew you i believelove no stageplaysnay i am not altogether so precise as youwould make me uncle i have loved them perhapstoo well in my time and now i condemnthem not altogether or in gross though i approvenot their excesses and extravagances icannot even in shakspeare but see many thingsboth scandalous to decency and prejudicial togood manners many things which tend to ridiculevirtue or to recommend vice at least tomitigate the hideousness of its features i cannotthink these fine poems are an useful studyand especially for the youth of either sex inwhich bloodshed is pointed out as the chief occupationof the men and intrigue as the sole employmentof the womenin making these observations everard wassimple enough to think that he was only givinghis uncle an opportunity of defending a favouriteopinion without offending him by a contrawoodstockdiction which was so limited and mitigated buthere as on other occasions he forgot how obstinatehis uncle was in his views whether of religionpolicy or taste and that it would be as easy toconvert him to the presbyterian form of governmentor engage him to take the abjuration oathas to shake his belief in shakspeare there wasanother peculiarity in the good knight's mode ofarguing which everard being himself of a plainand downright character and one whose religioustenets were in some degree unfavourable to thesuppressions and simulations often used in societycould never perfectly understand sir henrysensible of his natural heat of temper waswont scrupulously to guard against it and wouldfor some time when in fact much offended conducta debate with all the external appearance ofcomposure till the violence of his feelings wouldrise so high as to overcome and bear away theartificial barriers opposed to it and rush downupon the adversary with accumulating wrath itthus frequently happened that like a wily oldgeneral he retreated in the face of his disputantin good order and by degrees with so moderatew woodstocka degree of resistance as to draw on his antagonist'spursuit to the spot where at length makinga sudden and unexpected attack with horsefoot and artillery at once he seldom failed toconfound the enemy though he might not overthrowhimit was on this principle therefore that hearingeverard's last observation he disguised his angryfeelings and answered with a tone where politenesswas called in to keep guard upon passionthat undoubtedly the presbyterian gentry hadgiven through the whole of these unhappy timessuch proofs of an humble unaspiring and unambitiousdesire of the public good as entitled themto general credit for the sincerity of those verystrong scruples which they entertained againstworks in which the noblest sentiments of religionand virtue sentiments which might converthardened sinners and be placed with proprietyin the mouths of dying saints and martyrshappened from the rudeness and coarse tasteof the times to be mixed with some broad jestsand similar matter which lay not mich in theway excepting of those who painfully sought itwoodstock sjlout that they might use it in vilifying what wasin itself deserving of the highest applause butwhat he wished especially to know from his nephewwas whether any of those gifted menwho had expelled the learned scholars and deepdivines of the church of england from the pulpitand now flourished in their stead receivedany inspiration from the muses if he might useso profane a term without offence to colonel everardor whether they were not as sottishly andbrutally averse from elegant letters as they werefrom humanity and common sense colonel everard might have guessed by theironical tone in which this speech was deliveredwhat storm was mustering within his uncle's bosom nay he might have conjectured the stateof the old knight's feelings from his emphasis onthe word colonel by which epithet as that whichmost connected his nephew with the party hehated he never distinguished everard unlesswhen his wrath was rising while on the contrarywhen disposed to be on good terms withhim he usually called him kinsman or nephewmarkham indeed it was under a partial sensenwoodstockthat this was the case and in the hope to see hiscousin alice that the colonel forbore making anyanswer to the harangue of his uncle which hadconcluded just as the old knight had alighted atthe door of the lodge and was entering thehall followed by his two attendantsphoebe at the same time made her appearancein the hall and received orders to bring somebeverage for the gentlemen the hebe ofwoodstock failed not to recognize and welcomeeverard by an almost imperceptible courtesy but she did not serve her interest as she designedwhen she asked the knight as a question ofcourse whether he commanded the attendance ofmistress alice a stern no was the decided replyand the illtimed interference seemed to increasehis previous irritation against everard forhis depreciation of shakspeare i would insistsaid sir henry resuming the obnoxious sub sect were it fit for a poor disbanded cavalier touse such a phrase towards a commander of theconquering army upon knowing whether theconvulsion which has sent us saints and prophetswithout end has not also afforded us a poet withwoodstock senough both of gifts and grace to outshine poorold will the oracle and idol of us blinded andcarnal cavalierssurely sir replied colonel everard iknow verses written by a friend of the commonwealthand those too of a dramatic characterwhich weighed in an impartial scale might equaleven the poetry of shakspeare and which are freefrom the fustian and indelicacy with which thatgreat bard was sometimes content to feed thecoarse appetites of his barbarous audienceindeed said the knight keeping down hiswrath with difficulty i should like to be acquaintedwith this masterpiece of poetry maywe ask the name of this distinguished person it must be vicars or withers at leastsaid the feigned pageno sir replied everard nor drummondof hawthorne nor lord stirling neither and yet the verses will vindicate what i say ifyou will make allowance for indifferent recitationfor i am better accustomed to speak to abattalion than to those who love the muses thespeaker is a lady benighted who having lost her woodstockway in a pathless forest at first expresses herselfagitated by the supernatural fears to whichher situation gave risea play too and written by a roundheadauthor said sir henry in surprisea dramatic production at least replied hisnephew and began to recite simply but withfeeling the lines now so well known but whichhad then obtained no celebrity the fame of theauthor resting upon the basis rather of his polemicaland political publications than on the poetrydoomed in after days to support the eternalstructure of his immortalitythese thoughts may startle but will not astoundthe virtuous mind that ever walks attendedby a strongsiding champion

night the rest has escaped me said the reciter and i marvel i have been able to remember somuchsir henry lee who had expected some effusionvery different from those classical and beautifullines soon changed the scornful expressionof his countenance relaxed his contorted upperlip and stroking down his beard with his lefthand rested the forefinger of the right upon hiseyebrow in sign of profound attention aftereverard had ceased speaking the old man sighedas at the end of a strain of sweet music he thenspoke in a gentler manner than formerlycousin markham he said these versesflow sweetly and sound in my ears like the welltouchedwarbling of a lute but thou knowesti am something slow of apprehending the fullmeaning of that which i hear for the first timerepeat mc these verses again slowly and delibc woodstocklately for i always love to hear poetry twicethe first time for sound and the latter time forsensethus encouraged everard recited again thelines with more hardihood and better effect theknight distinctly understanding and from hislooks and motions highly applauding themyes he broke out when everard wasagain silent yes i do call that poetry though it were even written by a presbyterianor an anabaptist either ay there were good andrighteous people to be found even amongst the offendingtowns which were destroyed by fire andcertainly i have heard though but with littlecredence begging your pardon cousin everardthat there are men among you who have seen theerror of their ways in rebelling against the bestand kindest of masters and bringing it to thatpass that he was murdered by a gang yet fiercerthan themselves ay doubtless the gentlenessof spirit and the purity of mind which dictatedthose beautiful lines has long ago taught a manso amiable to say i have sinned i have sinnedyes i doubt not so sweet a harp has been brokenwoodstock even in remorse for the crimes he was witnessto and now he sits drooping for the shame andsorrow of england all his noble rhymes aswill sayslike sweet bells jangled out of tune and harshdost thou not think so master kerneguy not i sir henry answered the pagewhat dost not believe the author of theselines must needs be of the better file and leaningto our persuasion i think sir henry that the poetry qualifiesthe author to write a play on the subject of damepotiphar and her recusant lover and as for hiscalling that last metaphor of the cloud in a blackcoat or cloak with silver lining would have dubbedhim a tailor with me only that i happen toknow that he is a schoolmaster by professionand by political opinions qualified to be poetlaureate to cromwell for what colonel everardhas repeated with such unction is the productionof no less celebrated a person than johnmilton woodstock john milton exclaimed sir henry in astonishment what john milton the blasphemousand bloodyminded author of the defensepopuli anglican the advocate of the infernalhigh court of fiends the creature and parasiteof that grand

kerneguyyou will find beverage in my apartmentwhile phoebe stood gaping in admiration atthe sudden quarrel which had arisen coloneleverard's vexation and resentment was not alittle increased by the nonchance of the youngscotchman who with his hands thrust into hispockets with a courtly affectation of the timehad thrown himself into one of the antique chairsand though habitually too polite to laugh aloudand possessing that art of internal laughter bywhich men of the world learn to indulge theirmirth without incurring quarrels or giving directwoodstockoffence was at no particular trouble to concealthat he was exceedingly amused by the result ofthe colonels visit to woodstock colonel everard'spatience however had reached boundswhich it was very likely to surpass for thoughdiffering widely in politics there was a resemblancebetwixt the temper of the uncle and nephewdamnation exclaimed the colonel in atone which became a puritan as little as did theexclamation itselfamen said louis

objections to the suit which i am woodstockurging not in jest but most seriously as that onwhich my happiness depends rested only on the lowand precarious station of louis keraeguy alicethou hast the

meritthem it is that of auce lee nay nay arise do not kneel it is for your sovereign to kneel tothee alice to whom he is a thousand times moredevoted than the wanderer louis dared ventureto profess himself my alice has i know beentrained up in those principles of love and obeydienceto her sovereign that she cannot in conscienceor in mercy inflict on him such a woundas would be implied in the rejection of his suitin spite of all charles's attempts to preventher alice had persevered in kneeling on one kneeuntil she had touched with her lip the hand withwhich he attempted to raise her but this salutationended she stood upright with her armsfolded on her bosom her looks humble but composedkeen and watchful and so possessed of herself little flattered by the communication whichthe king had supposed would have been overpoweringthat he scarce knew in what termsnext to urge his solicitationthou art silent thou art silent he saidmy pretty alice has the king no more influencewith thee than the poor scottish page in one sense every influence said alice for he commands my best thoughts my bestwishes my earnest prayers my devoted loyaltywhich as the men of the house of lee have beenever ready to testify with the sword so are thewomen bound to seal if necessary with theirblood but beyond the duties of a true and devoirwoodstockted subject the king is even less to alice leethan poor louis kerneguy the page could havetendered an honourable union the monarch canbut offer a contaminated coronetyou mistake alice you mistake said theking eagerly sit down and let me speak toyou sit down what isn't you fear i fear nothing my lord answered alicewhat can i fear from the king of britain ithe daughter of his loyal subject and under myfather's roof but i remember the distance betwixtus and though i might trifle and jest withmine equal to ray king i must only appear in thedutiful posture of a subject unless where his safetymay seem to require that i do not acknowledgehis dignitycharles though young being no novice in suchscenes was surprised to encounter resistance ofa kind which had not been opposed to him insimilar pursuits even in cases where he had beenunsuccessful there was neither anger nor injuredpride nor disorder nor disdain real or affectedin the manners and conduct of alice shetond as it seemed calmly prepared to argue onwoodstock the subject which is generally decided by passionshowed no inclination to escape from the apartmentbut appeared determined to hear with patiencethe suit of the lover while her countenanceand manner intimated that she had this complaisanceonly in deference to the commands of thekingshe is ambitious thought charles it isby dazzling her love of glory not by mere passionateentreaties that i must hope to be successfuli pray you be seated my fair alice he saidthe lover entreats the king commands youthe king said alice may permit therelaxation of the ceremonies due to royalty buthe cannot abrogate the subject's duty even byexpress command i stand here while it is yourmajesty's pleasure to address me a patient listeneras in duty boundknow then simple girl said the kingthat in accepting my proffered affection andprotection you break through no law either ofvirtue or morality those who are born to royaltyare deprived of many of the comforts of privatelife chiefly that which is perhaps the dearest woodstockand most precious the power of choosing theirown mates for life their formal weddings areguided upon principles of political expedienceonly and those to whom they are wedded

lighter and more easy characterthan those which fetter other men whose marriageties as more voluntarily assumed ought in proportionto be more strictly binding and thereforeever since the time that old

recruited andthe mother lives in the greatness of her posterityhonoured and blessed as she died lamented andwept in the arms of love and friendshipdid rosamond so die my lord said aliceour records say she was poisoned by the injuredqueen poisoned without time allowed to call togod for the pardon of her many faults did hermemory so live i have heard that when thebishop purified the church at godstowe her monumentwas broken open by his orders and herbones thrown out into unconsecrated groundthose were rude old days sweet alice answeredcharles queens are not now so jealousnor bishops so rigorous and know besides thatin the lauds to which i would lead the loveliestof her sex other laws obtain which remove fromsuch ties even the slightest show of scandalthere is a mode of matrimony which fulfilling woodstockall the rites of the church leaves no stain on theconscience yet investing the bride with none ofthe privileges peculiar to her husband's conditioninfringes not upon the duties which the kingowes to his subjects so that alice lee mayin all respects become the real and lawful wife ofcharles stuart except that their private uniongives her no title to be queen of englandmy ambition said alice will be sufficientlygratified to see charles king without aimingto share either his dignity in public or hiswealth and regal luxury in privatei understand thee alice said the kinghurt but not displeased you ridicule me beinga fugitive for speaking like a king it is ahabit i admit which i have learned and ofwhich even misfortune cannot cure me but mycase is not so desperate as you may suppose myfriends are still many in these kingdoms my alliesabroad are bound by regard to their own interestto espouse my cause i have hopes given mefrom spain from france and from other nations arid i have confidence that my father's blood hasnot been poured forth in vain nor is doomed towoo us took dry up without due vengeance my trust is inhim from whom princes derive their title andthink what thou wilt of my present condition ihave perfect confidence that i shall one day sit onthe throne of englandmay god grant it said alice and thathe may grant it noble prince deign to considerwhether you now pursue a conduct likely to conciliatehis favour think of the course you recommendto a motherless maiden who has nobetter defence against your sophistry than whatthe natural feeling of female dignity inspireswhether the death of her father which would betheconsequence of her imprudence whether thedespair of her brother whose life has been so oftenin peril to save that of your majesty whetherthe dishonour of the roof which has shelteredyou will read well in your annals or are eventslikely to propitiate god whose controversy withyour house has been but too visible or recoverthe affections of the people of england in whoseeyes such actions are an abomination i leave toyour own royal mind to considerol iii d woodstockdiaries paused struck with a turn to the conversationwhich placed his own interests more incollision with the gratification of his present passionthan he had supposedif your majesty said alice curtseyingdeeply has no farther commands for my attendancemay i be permitted to withdraw stay yet a little strange and impracticablegirl said the king and answer me but onequestion is it the lowness of my present fortunesthat makes my suit contemptible i have nothing to conceal my liege shesaid and my answer shall be as plain and directas the question you have asked if i couldhave been moved to an act of ignominious insaneand ungrateful folly it could only arise from mybeing blinded by that passion which i believe ispleaded as an excuse for folly and for crime muchmore often than it has a real existence i mustin short have been in love as it is called andthat might have been with my equal but surelynever with my sovereign whether such only intitleor in possession of his kingdom yet loyalty was ever the pride almost thewnoijstork olruling passion of your family alice said thekingand could i reconcile that loyalty saidalice with indulging my sovereign by permittinghim to prosecute a suit dishonourable to himselfas to me ought i as a faithful subject tojoin him in a folly which might throw yet anotherstumblingblock in the path to his restorationand could only serve to diminish his securityeven if he were seated upon his throne at this rate said charles discontentedly i had better have retained my character of thepage than assumed that of a sovereign which itseems is still more irreconcilable with my wishesmy candour shall go still farther said alicei could have felt as little for louis kerneguyas for the heir of britain for such love as i haveto bestow and it is not such as i read of in romanceor hear poured forth in song has beenalready conferred on another object this givesyour majesty pain i am sorry for it but thewholesome medicines are often bitteryes answered the king with some asperity and physicians arc reasonable enough to woodstockpet their patients to swallow them as if theywere honeycomb it is true then that whisperedtale of the cousin colonel and the daughterof the loyal lee has set her heart upon a rebelliousfanatic my love was given ere i knew what thesewords fanatic and rebel meant i recalled it notfor i am satisfied that amidst the great distractionswhich divide the kingdom the person towhom you allude has chosen his part erroneouslyperhaps but conscientiously he therefore hasstill the highest place in my affection and esteemmore he cannot have and will not ask until somehappy turn shall reconcile these public differencesand my father be once more reconciled to himdevoutly do i pray that such an event may occurby your majesty s speedy and unanimous restoration you have found out a reason said theking pettishly to make me detest the thoughtof such a change nor have you alice any sincereinterest to pray for it on the contrary doyou not see that your lover walking side by sidewith cromwell may or rather must share liiwoodstock power nay if lambert does not anticipate himhe may trip up oliver's heels and reign in hisstead and think you not he will find means toovercome the pride of the loyal lees and achievean union for which things are better prepared thanthat which cromwell is said to meditate betwixtone of his brat and the no less loyal heir of fauconcernyour majesty said alice has found away at length to avenge yourself if what i havesaid deserves vengeancei could point out a yet shorter road to yourunion said charles without minding her distressor perhaps enjoying the pleasure of retaliation suppose that you sent your colonel wordthat there was one charles stuart here who hadcome to disturb the saints in their peaceful governmentwhich they had acquired by prayerand preaching pike and gun and suppose hehad the art to bring down a halfscore of troopersquite enough as times go to decide the fate ofthis heir of royalty think you not the possessionof such a prize as this might obtain from thebumpers or from cromwell such a reward as woodstockmight overcome your father's objections to aroundhead's alliance and place the fair alice andher cousin colonel in full possession of theirwishes my lord said alice her cheeks glowing andher eyes sparkling for she too had her share ofthe hereditary temperament of her family thispasses my patience i have heard without expressinganger the most ignominious persuasionsaddressed to myself and i have vindicated myselffor refusing to be the paramour of a fugitiveprince as if i had been excusing myself from acceptinga share of an actual crown but can youthink i can hear all who are dear to me slanderedwithout emotion or reply i will not sir andwere you seated with all the terrors of your father'sstarchamber around you you should hearme defend the absent and the innocent of myfather i will say nothing but that if he is nowwithout wealth without state almost without asheltering home and needful food it is because hespent all in the service of the king he needednot to commit any act of treachery or villainy toobtain wealth he had an ample competence inwooisiock his own possessions for markham everard heknows no such thing as selfishness he would notfor broad england had she the treasures of peruin her bosom and a paradise on her surface do adeed that would disgrace his own name or injurethe feelings of another kings my lord maytake a lesson from him my lord for the presenti take my leavealice alice stay exclaimed the king she is gone this must be virtue real disinterestedoverawing virtue or there is no suchthing on earth yet wilmot and villiers willnot believe a word of it but add the tale to theother wonders of woodstock tis a rare wench and i profess to use the colonel's obtestationthat i know not whether to forgive and be friendswith her or study a dire revenge if it were notfor that accursed cousin that puritan coloneli could forgive everything else to so noble awench but a roundheaded rebel preferred to methe preference avowed to my face and justifiedwith the assertion that a king might take a lessonfrom him it is gall and wormwood if the oldman had not come up this morning as he did the woodstockking should have taken or given a lesson and asevere one it was a mad rencontre to ventureupon with my rank and responsibility and yetthis wench has made me so angry with her andso envious of him that if an opportunity offeredi should scarce be able to forbear him ha whom have we here the interjection at the conclusion of this royalsoliloquy was occasioned by the unexpected entranceof another personage of the dramawoodstock chapter iiibenedict shall i speak a word in your ear claudia god bless me from a challengemuch ado about nothingas charles was about to leave the apartmenthe was prevented by the appearance of wildrakewho entered with an unusual degree of swaggerin his gait and of fantastic importance onhis brow i crave your pardon fair sir hesaid but as they say in my country whendoors are open dogs enter i have knocked andcalled in the hall to no purpose so knowing theway to this parlour sir for i am a light partizanand the road i once travel i never forgeti ventured to present myself unannounced sir henry lee is abroad sir i believe inthe chase said charles coldly for the appearanceof this somewhat vulgar debauchee was notagreeable to him at the moment and master woodstockalbert lee has left the lodge for two or threedaysi am aware of it sir said wildrake buti have no business at present with eitherand with whom is your business saidcharles that is if i may be permitted to asksince i think it cannot in possibility be withmepardon me in turn sir answered the cavalier in no possibility can it be imparted to anyother but yourself if you be as i think you arethough in something better habit master louisgirnigo the scottish gentleman who waits uponmaster albert leei am all you are like to find for him answeredcharlesin truth said the cavalier i do perceivea difference but rest and better clothing will domuch and i am glad of it since i would besorry to have brought a message such as i amcharged with to a tatterdemalionlet us get to the business sir if you pleasesaid the king you have a message for meyou say woodstock true sir replied wildrake i am thefriend of colonel markham everard sir a tallman and a worthy person in the field althoughi could wish him a better cause a message ihave to you it is certain in a slight note whichi take the liberty of presenting with the usualformalities so saying he drew his sword putthe billet he mentioned upon the point and makinga profound bow presented it to charlesthe disguised monarch accepted of it with agrave return of the salute and said as he wasabout to open the letter i am not i presumeto expect friendly contents in an epistle presentedin so hostile a manner a hem sir replied the ambassador clearinghis voice while he arranged a suitable answerin which the mild strain of diplomacy mightbe properly maintained not utterly hostile isuppose sir is the invitation though it be such asmust be construed in the commencement ratherbellicose and pugnacious i trust sir we shallfind that a few thrusts will make a handsome conclusionof the business and so as my old masterused to say pax nascitur ex bello for my own woodstockpoor share i am truly glad to have been gracedby my friend markham everard in this matter the rather as i feared the puritan principles withwhich he is embued i will confess the truth toyou worthy sir might have rendered him unwillingfrom certain scruples to have taken thegentlemanlike mode of righting himself in sucha case as the present and as i render a friend'sduty to my friend so i humbly hope masterlouis girnigo that i do no injustice to you inpreparing the way for the proposed meetingwhere give me leave to say i trust that if nofatal accident occur we shall be all better friendswhen the skirmish is over than we were before itbegani should suppose so sir in any case saidcharles looking at the letter worse than mortalenemies we can scarce be and it is that footingupon which this billet places us you say true sir said wildrake it issir a cartel introducing to a single combat forthe pacific object of restoring a perfect good understandingbetwixt the survivors in case thatfortunately that word can be used in the pluralafter the event of the meetingwoodstock in short wc only fight i suppose repliedthe king that we may come to a perfectlygood and amicable understandingyou are right again sir and i thank you forthe clearness of your apprehension said wildrake ah sir it is easy to do with a person ofhonour and of intellect in such a case as this andi beseech you sir as a personal kindness to myselfthat as the morning is like to be frosty andmyself am in some sort rheumatic as war willleave its scars behind sir i say i will entreatof you to bring with you some gentleman of honourwho will not disdain to take a part of whatis going forward a sort of potluck sir with'a poor old soldier like myself that we may takeno harm by standing unoccupied during suchcold weatheri understand sir replied charles if thismatter goes forward be assured i will endeavourto provide you with a suitable opponenti will remain greatly indebted to you sirsaid wildrake and i am by no means curiousabout the quality of my antagonist it is truei write myself esquire and gentleman and shouldwoodstockaccount myself especially honoured by crossingmy sword with that of sir henry or masteralbert lee but should that not be convenienti will not refuse to present my poor person inopposition to any gentleman who has served theking which i always hold as a sort of letters ofnobility in itself and therefore would on no accountdecline the duello with such a personthe king is much obliged to you sir saidcharles for the honour you do his faithfulsubjectso sir i am scrupulous on that point veryscrupulous when there is a roundhead inquestion i consult the herald's books to seethat he is entitled to bear arms as is mastermarkham everard without which i promiseyou i had borne none of his cartel but a cavalieris with me a gentleman of course be hisbirth ever so low his loyalty has ennobled hisconditionit is well sir said the king this

satisfaction with my sword as he requiresor will render him such cause for not doingso as he shall be contented withyou will excuse me sir said wildrakeif my mind is too dull under the circumstancesto conceive any alternative that can remain betwixttwo men of honour in such a case exceptingsa sa he threw himself into a fencingposition and made a pass with his sheathedrapier but not directed towards the person ofthe king whom he addressedexcuse me sir said charles if i do nottrouble your intellects with consideration of acase which may not occur but for examplewoodstocki may plead urgent employment on the part ofthe public this he spoke in a low and mysterioustone of voice which wildrake appearedperfectly to comprehend for he laid his forefingeron his nose with what he meant for a veryintelligent and apprehensive nodsir said he if you be engaged in anyaffair for the king ray friend shall have everyreasonable degree of patience nay i will fighthim myself in your stead merely to stay his stomachrather than you should be interrupted and sir if you can find room in your enterprisefor a poor gentleman that has followed langfordand goring you have but to name day timeand place of

when you shall have been pleased sir togive me a trifling scrap of writing to serve for mycredentials for such you know is the custom your written cartel hath its written answerthat sir will i presently do said charlesand in good time here are the materialsand sir continued the envoy ahi ahem if you have interest in the householdfor a cup of sack i am a man of few wordsand am somewhat hoarse with much speakingmoreover a serious business of this kind alwaysmakes one thirsty besides sir to partwith dry lips argues malice which god forbidshould exist in such an honourable conjuncturei do not boast much influence in the housesir said the king but if you would have thecondescension to accept of this broad piece towardsquenching your thirst at the george sir said the cavalier for the times admittedof this strange species of courtesy nor waswildrake a man of such peculiar delicacy askeenly to dispute the matter i am once againbeholden to you but i see not how it consistsvol in e woodstockwith my honour to accept of such accommodationunless you were to accompany and partakepardon me sir replied charles my safetyrecommends that i remain rather private atpresentenough said wildrake observed poorcavaliers must not stand on ceremony i see siryou understand cutter's law when one tall fellowhas coin another must not be thirsty i wishyou sir a continuance of health and happinessuntil tomorrow at the king's oak at six o'clockfarewell sir said the king and added aswildrake went down the stair whistling heyfor cavaliers to which air his long rapier jarringagainst the steps and bannisters bore no unsuitableburthen farewell thou too just emblemof the state to which war and defeat and despairhave reduced many a gallant gentlemanduring the rest of the day there occurred nothingpeculiarly deserving of notice alice sedulouslyavoided showing towards the disguisedprince any degree of estrangement or shynesswhich could be discovered by her father or byany one else to all appearance the two youngwoodstock persons continued on the same footing in everyrespect yet she made the gallant himself sensiblethat this apparent intimacy was assumedmerely to save appearances and in no way designedas retracting from the severity with whichshe had rejected his suit the sense that thiswas the case joined to his injured selflove andhis enmity against a successful

listenedalternately to the voice of wisdom and of passionatefollyprudence urged to him the importance of hisown life to the future prosecution of the great objectin which he had for the present miscarried the restoration of monarchy in england the rebuildingof the throne the regaining the crown ofhis father the avenging his death and restoringto their fortunes and their country the numerousexiles who were suffering poverty and banishmenton account of their attachment to his cause pridetoo or rather a just and natural sense of dignitywoodstockdisplayed the unworthiness a prince descendingto actual personal conflict with a subject of anydegree and the ridicule which would be thrownon his memory should he lose his life for an obscureintrigue by the hand of a private gentlemanwhat would his sage counsellors nicholasand hyde what would his kind and wise governorthe marquis of hertford say to such an actof rashness and folly would it not be likely toshake the allegiance of the staid and prudent personsof the royalist party since wherefore shouldthey expose their lives and estates to raise to thegovernment of a kingdom a young man who couldnot command his own temper to this was tobe added the consideration that even his successwould add double difficulties to his escape whichalready seemed sufficiently precarious if stoppingshort of death he merely had the better ofhis antagonist how did he know that he mightnot seek revenge b delivering up to governmentthe malignant louis kerneguy whose real charactercould not in that case fail to be discovered these considerations strongly recommended tocharles that he should clear himself of the chapwoodstock ienge without fighting and the reservation underwhich he had accepted it afforded him someopportunity of doing sobut passion also had her arguments which sheaddressed to a temper rendered irritable by recentdistress and mortification in the first placeif he was a prince he was also a gentleman entitledto resent as such and obliged to give orclaim the satisfaction expected on occasion ofdifferences among gentlemen with englishmenshe urged he could never lose interest byshowing himself ready instead of sheltering himselfunder his royal birth and pretensions tocome frankly forward and maintain what hehad done or said on his own responsibility inafree nation it seemed as if he would rathergain than lose in the public estimation by a conductwhich could not but seem gallant and generousthen a character for courage was farmore necessary to support his pretensions thanany other kind of reputation and the lying undera challenge viithout replying to it mightbring his spirit into question what would valleysand wilmot say of an intrigue in which he woodstockhad allowed himself to be shamefully baffled bya country girl and had failed to revenge himselfon the rival the pasquinades which they wouldcompose the witty sarcasms which they wouldcirculate on the occasion would be harder to endurethan the grave rebukes of hertford hydeand nicholas this reflection added to the stingsof youthful and awakened courage at lengthfixed his resolution and he returned to woodstockdetermined to keep his appointment comeof it what mightperhaps there mingled with his resolution asecret belief that such a rencontre would notprove fatal he was in the flower of his youthactive in all his exercises and no way inferior tocolonel everard as far as the morning's experimenthad gone in that of selfdefence at leastsuch recollection might pass through his royalmind as he hummed to himself a wellknownditty which he had picked up during his residencein scotlanda man may drink and not be drunka man may fight and not be slain a man may kiss a bonnie lassand yet be welcome back againwoodstock meanwhile the busy and alldirecting doctorrochecliffe had contrived to intimate to alicethat she must give him a private audience andshe found him by appointment in what was calledthe study once filled with ancient books whichlong since converted into cartridges had mademore noise in the world at their final exit thanduring the space which had intervened betwixtthat and their first publication the doctorseated himself in a highbacked leathern easychairand signed to alice to fetch a stool and sitdown beside himalice said the old man taking her hand affectionately thou art a good girl a wise girl a virtuousgirl one of those whose price is above rubiesnot that rubies is the proper translationbutremind me to tell you of that another time alicethou knowest who this louis kerneguy islayhesitate not to me i know everything i amwell aware of the whole matter thou knowestthis honoured house holds the fortunes of englandalice was about to answer nay speaknot but listen to me alice how does he bearhimself towards you woodstockalice coloured with the deepest crimsoned iam a countrybred girl she said and his mannersare too courtlike for meenough said i know it all alice he isexposed to a great danger tomorrow and youmust be the happy means to prevent him i prevent him how and in what manner said alice in surprise it is my duty as asubject to do anything anything that may becomemy father's daughtershere she stopped considerably embarrassedyes continued the doctor tomorrow hehath made an appointment an appointment withmarkham everard the hour and place are setsixin the morning by the kings oak if theymeet one will probably fallnow may god forefend they should meetsaid alice turning as suddenly pale as she hadpreviously reddened but harm cannot come ofit everard will never lift his sword against thekingfor that said doctor rochechffe iwould not warrant but if that unhappy younggentleman shall have still some reserve of thewoodstock loyalty which his general conduct entirely disavowsit would not serve us here for he knowsnot the king but considers him merely as a cavalierfrom whom he has received injurylet him know the truth doctor rochecliffslet him know it instantly said alice helift hand against the king a fugitive and defenceless he is incapable of it my life on theissue he becomes most active in his preservation that is the thought of a maiden aliceanswered the doctor and as i fear of a maidenwhose wisdom is misled by her affections itwere worse than treason to admit a rebel officerthe friend of the archtraitor cromwell into sogreat a secret i dare not answer for such rashnesshammond was trusted by his father andyou know what came of itthen let my father know he will meet markhamor send to him representing the indignitydone to him by attacking his guestwe dare not let your father into the secretwho louis kerneguy really is i did but hint woodstockthe possibility of charles taking refuge at woodstockand the rapture into which sir henry brokeout the preparations for accommodation and defencewhich he began to talk of plainly showedthat the mere enthusiasm of his loyalty wouldhave led to a risk of discovery it is you alicewho must save the hopes of every true royalisti answered alice it is impossible why cannot my father be induced to interfereas in behalf of his friend and guest though heknow him as no other than louis kerneguy you have forgot your father's character myyoung friend said the doctor an excellentman and the best of christians till there is aclashing of swords and then he starts up thecomplete martialist as deaf to every pacific reasoningas if he were a gamecockyou forget doctor rochechffe said alicethat this very morning if i understand thething aright my father prevented them fromfightingay answered the doctor because he deemedhimself bound to keep the peace in the royalpark but it was done with such regret alicewoodstock that should he find them at it again i am clearto foretell he will only so far postpone the combatas to conduct them to some unprivilegedground and there bid them tilt and welcomewhile he regaled his eyes with a scene so pleasingno alice it is you and you only who canhelp us in this extremity i see no possibility said she again colouring how i can be of the least useyou must send a note answered doctorrochecliffe to the king a note such as allwomen know how to write better than any mancan teach them to meet you at the precise hourof the rendezvous he will not fail you for iknow his unhappy foibledoctor rochecliffe said alice gravelyyou have known me from infancy what haveyou seen in me to induce you to believe that ishould ever follow such unbecoming counsel and if you have known me from infancyretorted the doctor what have you seen of methat you should suspect me of giving counsel tomy friend's daughter which it would be misbecomingin her to follow you cannot be foot woodstockenough i think to suppose that i mean youshould carry your complaisance farther than tokeep him in discourse for an hour or two till ihave all in readiness for his leaving this placefrom which i can fright him by the terrors of analleged search so c s mounts his horse andrides off and mistress alice lee has the honourof saving himyes at the expense of her own reputationsaid auce and the risk of an eternal stain onmy family you say you know all what canthe king think of my appointing an assignationwith him after what has passed and how will itbe possible to disabuse him respecting the purposeof my doing so i will disabuse him alice i will explainthe wholedoctor rochecliffe said alice you proposewhat is impossible you can do much byyour ready wit and great wisdom but if newfallensnow were once sullied not all your artcould wash it white again and it is altogetherthe same with a maiden's reputationalice my dearest child said the doctorwoodstock bethink you that if i recommend this means ofsaving the ife of the king at least rescuing himfrom instant peril it is because i see no other ofwhich to avail myself if i bid you assume evenfor a moment the semblance of what is wrongit is but in the last extremity and under circumstanceswhich cannot return i will take thesurest means to prevent all evil report which canarise from what i recommendsay not so doctor said alice betterundertake to turn back the isis than to stop thecourse of calumny the king will make boastto his whole licentious court of the ease withwhich but for a sudden alarm he could havebrought off alice lee as a paramour the mouthwhich confers honour on others will then be themeans to deprive me of mine take a fittercourse one more becoming your own characterand profession do not lead him to fail in anengagement of honour by holding out the

him the folly and the wickedness of thecourse he is about to pursue urge upon himthat he fear the sword since wrath bringeth thepunishment of the sword tell him that thefriends who died for him in the field at worcesteron the scaffolds and on the gibbets sincethat bloody day that the remnant who are inprison scattered fled and ruined on his accountdeserve better of him and his father's race

freedom toask him to withdraw as colonel everard and ihave some private business to settleit was doctor rochecliffes cue on this importantoccasion to have armed himself with theauthority of his sacred office and used a tone ofinterference which might have overawed even amonarch and made him feel that his monitorspoke by a warrant higher than his own but thewoodstock indiscreet latitude lie had just given to his ownpassion and the levity in which he had been detectedwere very unfavourable to his assumingthat superiority to which so uncontrollable a spiritas that of charles wilful as a prince andcapricious as a wit was at all likely to submitthe doctor did however endeavour to rally hisdignity and replied with the gravest and at thesame time the most respectful tone he could assumethat he also had business of the most urgentnature which prevented him from complyingwith master kerneguy's wishes and leavingthat spotexcuse this untimely interruption saidcharles taking off his hat and bowing to coloneleverard which i will immediately put anend toeverard gravely returned his salute and wassilentare you mad doctor rochecliff'e saidcharles or are you deaf or have you forgottenyour

low and impressive whispereverard observing this drew back the naturalgenerosity of his temper directing him to avoidoverhearing private discourse in which the safetyof the speakers might be deeply concernedthey continued however to observe great cautionin their forms of expressionmaster kerneguy said the clergyman itwoodstock is not i who assume authority or control overyour wishes god forbid i

cancel formerobligationsbethink yourself said the divine i cansay one word which will prevent all this do it replied the king and in doingso belie the whole tenor and actions of an honourablelife

almost forcibly detained by hisown side his follower wildrake whose greatercuriosity and lesser delicacy would otherwisehave thrust him forward to get if possible intothe secret but when he saw the doctor turn intothe coppice he whispered eagerly to everard a gold carolus to a commonwealth farthingthe doctor has not only come to preach a peacebut has brought the principal conditions alongwith him everard made no answer he had alreadyunsheathed his sword and charles hardly sawrochecliffe's back fairly turned than he lost notime in following his example but ere theyhad done more than salute

marked emphasis then added which shall number thee or such as theeamong her nobles and rulers nay fair alice said charles whose goodnature could not but feel the severity of this reproachthough too

not know a coronet had beenso superior in value to the crest of a private gentlemansaid everard yet i have heard thatmany women think soyou apprehend me amiss said alice perplexedbetween the difficulty of so expressingherself as to prevent immediate mischief and atthe same time anxious to combat the jealousyand disarm the resentment which she saw arisingin the bosom of her lover but she

turning his head towards her farewellalice at once and for ever the poor young lady whose adventitious spirithad almost deserted her attempted to repeatthe word farewell but failing in the attempt

remained of a kerchief interestedby the lady's evident distress though unable tocomprehend the mysterious cause hastened toassist the divine in supporting so fair a burthenmeanwhile the disguised

was passing abandonedalice to the care of wildrake whose extremedelicacy in the attempts he made to bring woodstockher back to life formed an amiable contrast tohis usual wildness and occupied him so muchthat he remained for the moment ignorant of thedisclosure in which he would have been so muchinterested as for doctor rochecliffe he cameforward wringing his hands in all the demonstrationof extreme anxiety and with the usual ex exclamations attending such a statepeace doctor rochecliffe said the kingwith such complete selfpossession as indeed becamea prince we are in the hands i amsatisfied of a man of honour master everardmust be pleased in finding only a fugitive princein the person in whom he thought he had discovereda successful rival he cannot but be awareof the feelings which prevented me from takingadvantage of the cover which this young lady'sdevoted loyalty afforded me at the risk of herown happiness he is the party who is to profitby my candour and certainly i

my dearfriend mark everard should prove a dog on thisoccasion rely on me i will cut his throat on thespot were i to do the same for myself the momentafterward hush hush my good friend and loyal subjectsaid the king and compose yourself for though i am obliged to put on the princefor a moment we have not privacy or safety toreceive our subjects in king cambyses veineverard who had stood for a

nowpassed is but a dream if they are in such astate that i can aid them saving my duty to thecommonwealth which will permit me to be privyto no schemes of actual violence your majestymay command my servicesit may be i may be troublesome to yousir said the king for my fortunes are not suchas to permit me to reject even the most limitedoffers of assistance but if i can i will dispensewith applying to you i would not willingly putwoodstock any man's compassion at war with his sense ofduty on my account doctor i think there willbe no farther taking today either with sword orcane so we may as well return to the lodgeand leave these looking at alice and everard who may have more to say in explanation no no exclaimed alice who was now perfectlycome to herself and partly by her own observationpartly from the report of dr rochecliffscomprehended all that had taken placemy cousin everard and i have nothing to explainhe will forgive me for having riddled withhim when i dared not

speed to which we beg to contributeour royal aid when fit time comes we hope tofind other service for himas he spoke he slid ten pieces into the handof poor wildrake who confounded with the excessof his loyal gratitude blubbered like a childand would have followed the king had not tor rochecliife in few words but peremptoryinsisted that he should return with his patronpromising him he should certainly be employedin assisting the king's escape could an opportunitybe found of using his servicesbe so generous reverend sir and you bindme to you for ever said the cavalier and iconjure you not

wecannot be better friends do not at least let us entertainharder or worse thoughts of each otherthan we have nowthere was something in the manner of charlesthat was extremely affecting something too inhis condition as a fugitive in the kingdom whichwas his own by inheritance that made a directappeal to everard's bosom though in contradictionto the dictates of that policy which hejudged it this duty to pursue in the distracted circumstancesof the country he remained as wehave said uncovered and in his manner testifiedthe highest expression of reverence up to thepoint when such might seem a symbol of allegiancehe bowed so low as almost approach hislips to the hand of charles but he did not kisswoodstock it i would rescue your person sir he saidwith the purchase of my own life more ho stopped short and the king took up his sentencewhere it broke off more you cannot dosaid charles to maintain an honourable consistency but what you have said is enough youcannot render homage to my

pause accordingly during whichan idea seized upon cromwell's imagination bring me hither he said yonder stool and placing it beneath one of the windows ofwhich there were two so high in the wall as notto be accessible from the floor he clambered upinto the entrance of the window which was sixor seven feet deep corresponding with the thicknessof the wall come up hither pearsonsaid the general but

a turret which was about to be dispersedin massive fragments through the air andhe felt small confidence in the length of timewhich might be allowed for his escape from sucha dangerous vicinity the duty of constant vigilanceupon his post was partly divided by thisnatural feeling which induced him from time totime to bend his eyes on the miners below insteadof keeping them rivetted on the opposite turretat length the interest of the scene arose to theuttermost after entering and returning from theturret and coming out again more than once inwoodstock the course of about twenty minutes

from his precariousstand and jumped himself down into thechamber the gigantic trooper went sheer downtwenty feet struck against a projecting battlementwhich launched the wretched man outwards andthen

pearson was still musing on his generalscommands both these men were agitatorsin their army and old soldiers whom cromwellwas accustomed to treat with great familiarity so that robins had no hesitation to ask captainpearson whether he meant to execute thecommands of the general even to the letterpearson shook his head with an air of doubtbut added there was no choice leftbe assured said the old man that if thoudoest this folly thou wilt cause israel to sin andthat the general will not be pleased with your servicethou knowest and none better than thouthat oliver although he be like unto david the sonwoodstockof jesse in faith and wisdom and courage yetthere are times when the evil spirit cometh uponhim as it did upon saul and he uttered commandswhich he will not thank any one for executingpearson was too good a politician to assent directlyto a proposition which he could not deny he only shook his head once more and said that itwas easy for those to talk who were not

where many personsof quality wide others of inferior rank had stationedthemselves to gratulate him as he passedtowards the capitalthere was one group however which attractedpeculiar attention from those around on accountof the respect shown to the party by thesoldiers who kept the ground and who whethercavaliers or roundheads seemed to contest emulouslywhich should contribute most to their accommodation for both the elder and youngergentlemen of the party had been distinguished inthe civil wars woodstockit was a family group of which the principalfigure was an old man seated in a chair

of their appearance gavethem even in th eyes of the coarsest of the peoplean air of patriarchal dignity which commandedgeneral regard and they sat upon thebank which they had chosen for their station bythe way side as undisturbed as if they had beenin their own parkand now the distant clarion announced theroyal presence onward came pursuivant andtrumpet onward came plumes and cloth of goldand waving standards displayed and swordsgleaming to the sun and at length heading agroup of the noblest in england and supportedby his royal brothers on either side onward cameking charles he had already halted more thanonce in kindness perhaps as well as policy toexchange a word nth persons whom he recognizedamong the spectators and the shouts of thebysanders applauded a courtesy which seemedso well timed but when he had gazed an instanton the party we have described it was impossibleif even alice had been too much changed to berecognized not instantly to know bevis and hisvenerable master the monarch sprung from hiwooustock sthorse and walked instantly up to the old knightamid thundering acclamations which rose fromthe multitudes around when they saw charleswith his own hand oppose the

hand in both his own and stooped hishead towards him to catch his accents while theold man detaining him with the other hand saidsomething faltering of which charles could onlycatch the quotation

the sound oftrumpets and drums again rose amid the acclamationswhich had been silent while the kingstopped while the effect of the whole processionresuming its motion was so splendidly dazzlingthat even alice's anxiety about her father's healthwas for a moment suspended while her eye followedthe long line of varied brilliancy that proceededover the heath when she looked again atsir henry she was startled to see that his cheekwhich had gained some colour during his convertiii at woodstocknation with the king had relapsed into earthypaleness that his eyes were closed and openednot again and
