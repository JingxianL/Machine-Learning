familiarity of happydomestic life to subjects of an exclusivecharacter it is almost impossibleto keep alive the attention ofvi prefacechildren impressionable as they arethe impression must be varied in orderto be attractive perhaps even to beinstructive in these rude pictures ofthe east there is no invention theyare the vivid recollections of men andthings seen under circumstances favourableto the writer and whichmade many objects accessible to himwhich are not accessible to the ordinarytravelleras to the stories connected withoriental superstitions i have recordedthem as i heard them without addingor subtracting a single circumstancethey appeared to me well fitted togive some variety to the conversationsand to have the merit of illustratingpreface vlleastern character these form but asmall portion of the number i collectedi do not see how such narrativescan be injurious to the mindsof children who may safely be trustedwith such tales of wonder and mysteryin these days and in a countryso much emancipated from superstitionand credulity as our own would theemancipation were complete theymay exercise their minds in endeavouringto explain apparently supernaturalevents by ordinary causes anexplanation may no doubt be foundwhen tip exaggerations of ignoranceare cleared awayi have thought it desirable to carryout the plan i originally proposedvlll prefaceto myself in the earlier volumes ofminor morals by introducing somevariety of subjects in order to preventthe weariness of attention too lonof directedto the same topictravels o how i wish i could travel into foreigncountries exclaimed george one day whohad been delighted with a promise of mrhoward that he would talk to them all abouthis journey into oriental landsi often dream about travelling addededith and all sorts of places come into myhead and i fancy i am there i shouldlike to see them and to compare my fancyof them with what they really arebut as that cannot be said mr howardwhat an advantage it is to have bookswritten by intelligent people who come andtell us what they have seen and enable usif vol iii b minor moralswithout any difficulty or danger to accompanythem in their long journies who show uswhat is most interesting and do not wearyus with what is dull or disagreeable therewas a very amusing fellow at florence whoused in the piazza of the grand duke togather crowds about him by its accounts ofdistant regions now we will go to petersburghe would say or what is betteri will take you there for if you went yourselfit would cost you a mint of money and youmight be frozen among the snows or breakyour neck on the corduroy roads and wouldbe certainly cheated by the postillions andtormented by the police but i will tell youabout the winter palace and the marblepalace and the river neva and the statueof peter the great and of the icehills andthe sledges and the long beards of the peasantsand the northern lights and when youtravels are tired of this i will convey you witlioiitany fear of bandits or of the fevers of thepontine marshes to rome and i will showyou the holy father in the vatican andthe sublime cathedral of st peter and theforum and the tarpeian rock and youshall neither be wearied nor annoyed all theway i think said george i should enjoythe weariness and annoyance of such interestingjournies because i know one could nothave the journey without the annoyance andthen papa when the trouble is over it isvery pleasant to recollect and to be able totalk to our friends of the difficulties anddangers we have passed throughwell my boy answered mr howardi hope you will think so when the difficultiesand dangers really come you will be allthe better for your determination and you minor moralswill have i dare say in after life manyand many an opportunity of using your courageousphilosophydid you ever suffer much from climatepapa inquired edith for even here ourhot summers melt us and our cold vvdntersfreeze us and we have much ado to keepourselves comfortablethere are inconveniences my dear manyand great but considering how extremelyunlike the habitable regions of the earth areto one another i often think with delightupon the facility with which the human beingsupports them all the provisions of naturefor the maintenance of life are various andwonderful man whose wants and curiosityinduce him to visit such different climatesis of all animals the best adapted to varioustemperatures and finds the means of accommodatinghimself to great fluctuations of heattravels and cold you have heard of living personspassing in a hot oven time enough to roast ajoint of meat in russia the peasants oftencome forth from their hot steam baths androll themselves in the snow and i rememberto have heard berzelius the great swedishchemist remark that of all the substanceshe had ever made experiments on the humanskin was that which most easily and withthe least alteration accommodated itself to theaction of different temperatures animals youknow change much of their nature under theinfluence of climate the wool of the sheepbecomes hairy in the south the hair of therat becomes woolly in the north seeds donot lose their germinating power under anynatural heat or cold not that seeds willgrow in all climates but they may be preservedin them tropical seeds would notlose their power of reproduction by a voyage minor moralsto the north nor would a visit to the equatordestroy those of the coldest regions i have heard papa said george thatthe vital principle is so vigorous that therehave been found in herculaneum and pompeiiclosed up from the action of the air grainsof corn which have sprung forth when plantedin the appropriate place and season grainswhose life would have been thought extinguishednearly eighteen hundred years agowhat an advantage said arthur thepresent time has over the past a longjourney can now be accomplished far moreeasily than a short one in ancient daysyes said mr howard the progressof science is nowhere so visible as in theremoval of difficulties in the way of communicationin saxon times the merchant whohad undertaken three sea voyages for his ownaccount was admitted into the ranks of honourtravels obtaining the title of thane a travellerinto remote countries was an object of admiration and indeed in all ages he hasperhaps been the most valuable aid to humanhappiness he has opened the way to theknowledge and the possession of ten thousandsources of enjoymentnow papa you have travelled so muchtell me after all what is the most pleasantof all your travelling recollections indeed edith the most agreeable ofmy thoughts is this that the whole universeis full of felicity that if there are sufferingsand sorrows in the world they are exceptionsto the general rule we sometimes thinkthat the deprivation of pleasures such as wepossess must be accompanied by much annoyanceand wretchedness but our judgmentson such matters are generally erroneous iwill give you one or two examples from my minor moralsown experience showing how the mind accommodatesitself to the circumstances thatsurround iti went once into the hut of a russianserf it was made of logs of wood andthough the winter was bitterly cold the onlywindows were small square holes throughwhich the snow was driven by the sharpwinds and when the door was opened inthere rushed showers of sleet and hoarfrostwithin was a smoky and suffocating heatproduced by the burning of damp wood in astove the inhabitants were a boor his wifeand three children covered with dirt andvermin and the whole family were thevassals of a neighbouring nobleman theywere attached to the soil according to thefeudal usages had no will of their own theycould possess no property and were almostwithout any legal right ah they could gaintravels was claimed by and paid to their master andof the produce of the fields they cultivatedno part came to their share but such a portionas enabled them to support existence theintolerableness of slavery we often hear ofand it is well that slavery should appearintolerable to the free but when the slavecannot shake off his fetters it is to him atleast a privilege to be contented with hisposition i was curious to hear what notionsa russian boor had of freedom and of hisown condition peter petrovich was sittingin his ragged sheepskin garment on a blockof wood carving a common amusement ofthe peasant ornaments out of the thigh boneof an ox i sat down by him and askedhow far he had ever travelled never tenverses from where i was born said heshould not you like to see a great city i have heard of one i don't know whatb minor moralswas its name from ivan carlovich and that'senough for me can you read or write not i what would be the use of readingor writing the priest reads to me andsaves me the trouble and i have nobody towrite to and nothing to write about shouldyou not like a better house i do notknow what i should do with it it would onlyadd to my trouble the love of independenceis often said to be an instinct of man anatural irrepressible feeling but when iasked peter petrovich if he ever thought ofbuying his freedom of endeavouring to becomehis own master he looked surprised and said am i a fool do not i know when i amwell off must not my lord provide for me how could i provide for myself it wasin vain i sought to touch a chord which issaid to vibrate on all minds the love ofliberty but liberty to him was to have totravels take no care for himself j he fancied he shouldbe cumbered and perplexed about the meansof existence no no said he my lordmust keep me from starvation must give meahouse to live in and garments if i vantthem i free who is to feed me clotheme shelter me but my master but surelyif you were to labour for yourself and keepall the money you gain you might havebetter food and garments and a more comfortablehouse it was in vain to talk topeter petrovich my master must providefor me was the burthen of his story hefelt like a child unaccustomed to walk alonewhen the hand that guides it is about to bewithdrawn or a boy unable to swim whois menaced with being placed out of his depthin the water and perhaps there will bemany a generation of peter petroviches before minor moralsany desire to change their condition will prevailamong the peasant serfs of russia is it not a lamentable state of thingsthat they should be so deadened to all generousfeeling inquired georgeit would be yet more lamentable ifwithout any chance of happy change they weresensible of their degraded state but by andby commerce and the silent spread of improvementwill produce uncomfortable feelingsand they will contrast their conditionwith that of happier nations and then movedeither by the fears of their revolt or by a morebenevolent principle such as the desire to promotetheir improvement their government willemancipate them by its own act or they willobtain their emancipation by their united exertionssuch is the progress of intelligenceand it is impossible not to hope that it willtravels ultimately better the condition of every partof the human raceone of the happiest families i have seenwas that of a poor sailor settled on theshores of the bay of biscay i was oncelanded at the small seaport town where theydwelt theirs was a small cottage coveredwith vines from which hung at the time ofmy visit huge bunches of grapes it wasduring the peninsular war that i was compelledto seek a landingplace on the stormy andrugged coast of calabria the sailor whohad taken charge of me from an english shipof war was at first an object of no smallanxiety to me for i had a large sum of moneyin my possession he was a perfect strangerand i wholly in his power his frank andobvious honesty however soon won all myconfidence and i slept under his humblecovering with less distrust than had i been minor moralsbeneath a palace roof he brought me thewhite bread for which spain is celebratedand large bunches of fragrant muscadel grapesthe best bed was made up for my reposingplace and when i slept i was recommendedto the care of the virgin of whom an earthenwareimage was suspended with gay ribbonsabove my pillow yet those were terribletimes for war had ravaged the country andthere was on every side the track of devastationone day tine french troops anotherday the spanish guerillas set fire to the mostancient and remarkable edifices of the landwhole villages were depopulated and it hassometimes happened to me to arrive in desertedstreets and to find all the houses unroofedand half of them wholly destroyedscenes of horror recorded deeds of horrorforeign invasion and civil war had each inturn made spain a field of blood the chascities of the human character were likely tobe invaded if not destroyed by those sufferingswhich were exhibited day by day buteven among those who suffered most therewere many who retained their kind and hospitablefeelings i well remember when i leftthe cottage of the spanish sailor that he providedfor me two stout young women whocarried my luggage in perfect safety over themountains on foot and deposited it in thetown to which i was bound it was not easyto travel in safety but a long day's journeybrought them and me to the capital of theprovince he would accept no pecuniaryrecompense he seemed to consider himselfresponsible for my safety and well mighthis spontaneous and unsought courtesies deeplyeffect my mind do you want nothing i inquired on leaving him i want nothingi will take nothing the virgin guide youon your way the sheriff of mekkathe children took the earliest opportunityof finding their papa disengaged in orderto remind him that he had said he would letthem hear about egypt and palestine andturkey and greece and other remote regions and tell us about those beautiful mahometancountries and all the people exclaimed edithbut was not mahomet a wicked imposterpapa inquired arthur and do not themahometan call christians dogs and treatthem with much scorn and illwill it has been truly and wisely said repliedmr howard that there is a soul of goodnessin things evil and the false religions thathave made so much progress in the worldthe sheriff of mekka never could have succeeded but for the minglingof truths with their errors of virtueswith their defects and of bright points contrastedwith their darknessare there not many good men amongmussulmanss asked edithand even among pagans added arthurit is not likely that the divine beingshould have given to any portion of hiscreatures a monopoly of excellence or thathe should have left a part of the race ofman without a capacity for virtue and happinessand i have often found personsamong the mussulmanss of whom christiansmight well have been proud men hospitablebeneficent and tolerant in the highest degreei remember an instance which i will mentionto you as showing how much even the loveof truth may exist in the mind of a mahometanwhen travelling in egypt i got into a consminor moralstraverse with a turkish friend as to thesuperiority of the christian over the mahometanreligion he had more than oncetold me it was a subject on which he didnot object to talk with me though heand mahometan generally avoided all discussionswith christians who began by treatingtheir prophet with scorn and their holy bookwith irreverence you may think mahometnot to have been a prophet but you alwaysallow him to have been a wonderful man you may not admit that our koran is divinelyinspired but you acknowledge it has passagesof great poetical beauty that some of itsdescriptions of god are eloquent and elevatedand that you have often turned over itspages with pleasure and sometimes with improvementwell now i will tell you whati think of your religion and of your christianprophet for you know the mussulmanss allowthe sheriff of mekka jesus christ whom they call issa to havebeen a prophet i would willingly makeissa the arbiter between you and me iwould tell him where i was born how i wastaught what passed in my mind and askhim whether i could be other than what iam a conscientious mussulman nay more if you think there is no road to future happinessbut that in which you walk and thatthe road in which i am walking leads to everlastingperdition i should be willing that issahimself should decide on my future conditioni would say to him i am travelling by onepath and endeavouring to get into paradise and my christian opponent is travelling by anothersure i am that he would stretch out hishand to both of us and help us on our way and acknowledge that one of the faithfulmoslems might be entitled to his favours minor moralsequally with his own followers i felt thewords of the turk were a noble testimonyto genuine christianity the religion of charityand rejoiced to hope and to believe he hadnot mistaken the character of the founder ofour faithi think i have observed papa that thosewho have travelled generally speak with morekindness of persons of different opinions thanthose who have never left their countrysaid georgeno doubt it is one of the advantages oftravel that it destroys petty prejudices andmakes us better acquainted with the realityof things by travel we are taught that othercountries as well as our own have much torecommend them and their inhabitants haveoften qualities to love and to honourbut tell me if travelling teach us tothe sheriff of mekka love other countries more does it not alsomake us love our own country less askededithby no means it is on the contraryon returning home from foreign lands thatthe love of our fatherland burns strongest inthe bosom but i will tell you another storyof a mussulman which will interest youbecause the subject of it is a very remarkablemanpray do exclaimed all the childreni heard the early history of the latesheriff of mekka from mahomet ali pashahimself he was one of the direct descendantsof mahomet and the head of one of themost distinguished tribes of the desert thetribe of on which more than any otherhas sought to preserve all its patriarchalusages and to keep itself pure from whatthey call the contamination of towns the minor moralswilderness is their home and though manyof the tribe are called to hold office in theholy city they invariably send their childreninto the desert to preserve them from theeffeminate influence of those who livewithin walls the sheriff is a man of atall and imposing presence his eye brightand fierce as a lynx's his skin perfectly blackhis movements rapid but easy and hiswhole bearing impressive and stately hehad much distinguished himself in variousmilitary encounters had received fourteen orfifteen wounds and was considered in a wordas the most illustrious warrior of the hedjazon the application of the pasha of egyptto the sultan of turkey the sheriffdom ofthe holy city the highest arabian dignitywas conferred upon him but as his newoffice brought new influence he became anobject of apprehension to mahomet ali whothe sheriff of mekka found it necessary to secure his person byan ingenious stratagem on occasion of somefestivity lie ordered one of his captains inthe red sea to invite the sheriff and hisattendants to a repast on board his vesselwhich was then laying at edda the sheriffcame with his people and when they wereall on board and engaged in the enjoymentsof the table the anchor was raised thevessel set sail and the sheriff and his friendswere delivered over to the governor of suezwho escorted them safely to cairo where ihad the pleasure of making the sheriff'sacquaintance and found him surrounded ifnot with the splendours of independence withmuch of the pomp and parade of orientallifethe sheriff is still living at cairo andi went with the english consulgeneral topay him an evening visit the sun had minor moralsbut just set and we found him engagedwith about forty persons in acts of devotionthey were repeating the allah ilia allah mahomet resoul allah and bendingtheir foreheads to the dust in frequent prostrations while on rising they sung religioushymns to the sound of the pipe and taborwe remained at a distance until the servicewas over we then approached and werereceived with great courtesy and requestedto take our seats next to the sheriff on thedivan of which he occupied the corner hisson an intelligent lad of about ten or twelveyears old sat on his right hand the mostdistinguished of the guests took their placesmore or less remote on the divan accordingto their ranks and about thirty servants there is no god but god and mahomet isgod's prophet fyiaan m iithe sheriff of mekka osmanlis egyptians negro slaves andeunuchs clad in a great variety of costumefor the most part richly ornamented stoodin a semicircle about the divanhandsome pipes coffee and sherbet accordingto the oriental custom were introducedand the conversation began to be veryinteresting and animated as it became moregeneral i observed that one of the gueststook a more prominent part than the restand that diis opinions had much weight withthe company he had been a great travellerhad visited calcutta and many parts of britishindia and he told the sheriff that therewere some millions of faithful mussulmanssin that part of the world upon which wesaid that it was the policy as it was theduty of the british government to protectthem in the full enjoyment of their religiousopinions and the exercise of their religiousvol iii c minor moralsrites the sheriff ordered his scribe to besent for and to seat himself on the divanhe came bearing in his sash an inkstandgirdled with diamonds from which he took abeautifully decorated reed and the sheriffwhile his eye glistened with delight directedhim to record all that had been saidrespecting british india we know somethingof hindostan he added it suppliesmekka with almost all the articles we consumewe see a great many pilgrims from thatcountry your government does not interferewith them that is just that is righthe made many inquiries about europewas there not a very great warrior theresome years ago you mean napoleonbuonaparte he had not heard his namehe said but had heard of his deeds andwas he not conquered and sent away to diein exile he was but if he was sothe sheriff of mekka great a warrior how came lie to be conquered because there was a greater warrior tianlie and what was that other warrior'sname wellington put that down putthat down said the sheriff to the scribe and what is the name of your king we have no king we have a queen what a woman put that down scribe put that down and what is your queen'sname victoria alexandrina and whatis the meaning of her name victoria isyour nasal a name given to celebrate thegreat victory of the great warrior we werespeaking of write that scribe but alexandrinewhat is the meaning of that uponwhich we pointed out the relationship betweenthe royal family of england and the imperialfamily of russia and that it was in honourof an emperor of the north that the nameof alexandrina was given but arabs have minor moralsno notions of any latitude in namegivingand we did not succeed in making thereasons clear to the sheriff it was tooremote an association of cause and effect and he said quietly i do not understandthis but he did not say to the scribe putthat down but do your people ever see yourqueen does she unveil her face indeedshe does and a very pretty face it is mashallah put it down scribe wehad just been reading in the papers anaccount of the city festival in honour of thequeen and described it to the astonishedsheriff as well as we could the unveiledqueen the unveiled ladies of the court theceremonials the feasting the procession thespeechifying mashallah mashallah imust believe it because you say it put itdown scribe put it all downthe sheriff of mekka the children were amused with mr howard'sstory and had quite forgotten theconversation that led to it little edith satthrilling with pleasure in her chair shewas so delighted she clapped her hands but at last cried out go on go on papa the mussulman traveller said a few wordsto the sheriff and the sheriff inquired ofus whether it was true that in europe thesea rose and the sea fell at stated seasonsas we of course answered in the affirmativeinquire said the traveller what is thecause of the rise and fall of the sea thescribe was directed to be attentive and weanswered that it had been observed to followthe changes of the moon but that our wisemen had not been able to explain the theoryof the tides i have another question toask which is to me a mystery tell mewhy that which is secreted from the eyes minor moralsis salt from the mouth is sweet and fromthe ears is bitter we child only referto the wonderful organization of the humanframe and to the adaptation of all its partsto the purposes for which they were destinedbut we could not explain the cause it isa mystery to you who are christians andto us who are mahometan it is a mysteryto all yes said one of the company but may not christians and mahometanagree in this that the god wiio made the seatorise and fall and who gave those differentcharacters to the secretions of the head ofman may we not all say that he is thefather of us all and that he is most greatmost wise and most good wallah tayib exclaimed the sheriff and tayib thatis well was echoed by every voice andresounded through the room never was imore delighted or more affected this wasthe sheriff of mekka something like a triumph of religious truthsubduing in that moment of honest enthusiasmevery thought of uncharitablenessthe nileare not the egyptians very proud of theircountry asked georgethe love of country answered mr howard is one of the strongest of humanpassions but it has been thought to existless strongly in flat than in mountainouslands among the egyptians the attachmentis less to the soil than to the river theriver nile which is in their eyes as it wasin the eyes of their forefathers a sort ofdivinity they speak of their nile withthe intensity of personal affections it is theirdaily benefactor to it they owe their wealthbe that wealth great or small the verdurethe nile of their fields their food their drink theirclothing for it produces the vegetables andthe fish they eat it gives the water withwhich they quench their thirst and cooktheir victuals it causes the cotton tree togrow of which they make their garments it supplies their flocks and herds there isnot a woman on its banks who from thetime at which she first is able to carry apitcher on her head or bear one in herhand does not daily replenish it in thesacred and venerable stream its praise passesinto their proverbs into their daily talk iremember travelling to the bahr el youssoufiand having alighted i gave my horse to apoor fellah woman when on remounting put a small coin into her hand she saidmay allah bless thee as he blessed thecourse of the nile a hundred times ihave been told in egypt you will returnc minor moralshither no one ever drank the waters ofthe nile without being irresistibly impelledto drink them again and the water thoughnot clear is delicious and healthful theegyptian levantines have a saying thatwhat champagne is to other wines is thenile to other waters and there is also anarabian proverb had mahomet drank thewaters of the nile he would have stayed onearth and not have allowed himself to beconveyed to paradise is there much sailing on the nile papa will you tell us what sorts of boats areused said ediththere are between five and six thousandboats constantly in movement on the twobranches of the nile the rosetta and damiettabranches and from the point of their unionup to essouan there is the first cataractas it is called but it is not a cataract it isthe nile merely a rapid where the waters rush throughthe granite rocks having however channelsso large that during many months of theyear the boats can be hauled through andproceed to wadi haifa the second cataractboats on the nile are of all sizes fromthe smallest punt to terms which will convey tons of goods they are for the mostpart of coarse construction carrying enormouslylarge triangular sails and are frequentlyoverturned by the sudden gusts onthe river it has happened to me to besailing quietly up one bank of the nileand all of a sudden without any notice tofind my boat whirled away and left highand dry on the opposite side accidentsare perpetually occurring so often thatthey excite little interest and the arabswill seldom interfere to succour the wrecked minor moralsin december t i was sailing up the nilein one of the pacha's boats and we saw inthe middle of the stream keel upwards anoverturned vessel on whose sides were apilgrim and three or four other persons whostretched out their hands towards us as wepassed and cried imploringly for aid oursailors would not listen either to our requestsor to our menaces requiring them to stopthey answered there were other teats behind and so there were two boats with englishtravellers who appealed to like ourselves didall they could to induce their arab sailors to helpthe shipwrecked people but it was all in vainthey had a fine wind they said and would notbe delayed besides why did not they swim though then the surface of the nile wasrough as the stormy ocean and he must havebeen a good swimmer indeed who would havethe nile trusted its waves the arabs might havedone so for they are almost amphibious butthe poor pilgrim and what became of the poor pilgrimpapa asked edithwhy being invested with some authoritywe applied to the governor of the next townwe reached i think it was manfalout andhe despatched a boat in order to save theshipwrecked people they had been able tocling to the keel of the vessel till succourarrived and they were brought safe to shoreexcept one whom the waves had washedaway from the vesselis not manfalout the place where travellersbegin to see crocodiles on the nile inquired george between whom and his papathe following conversation took place yes but they sometimes come lower minor moralsdown however it is only above manfaloutthat they are seen in great numbers in great numbers papa how manyhave you seen at once perhaps forty or fifty basking in thesun i once counted fourteen close togetheron a very small sandbank in the middle ofthe nile do they fly from travellers always when they are awakeand is there any truth in the story thatthey have a little bird to attend them andgive them notice of danger there is a bird on the nile found ingreat numbers in the places most frequentedby the crocodile called by the arabs theziczac and by europeans the monitor whichalways rises with a sharp noise somewhatlike its arabic name and which is the birdthe nile supposed to be the crocodile's guardian thestory had its origin probably in the simultaneousflight of the bird and of the crocodileon the approach of danger an intelligentenglish traveller however told me that hehad himself seen the monitor give notice tothe crocodile of the arrival of travellersdoes the crocodile often attack travellerso no it is really a timid animal feedingprincipally on fish and flying the neighbourhoodof man but if it can attack ahuman being without danger it will not hesitateto do so it is not an unfrequentthing when a crocodile has been killed tofind bracelets or other ornaments undigestedin its bowelsare they easily caught not easily but there are some of thearabs who are very dextrous in the pursuit minor moralsand capture of the crocodile the governorof girgeh told me of a peasant who hadkilled in one day no less than seventeenlarge crocodiles he was in the habit ofpresenting himself to the crocodile in thewater with a heavy dagger in his hand andof stabbing the animal in the mouth orthroat but the crocodile is far more agilethan he is generally supposed to be andturns round with great ease considering hisunwieldy sizedo

mamma exclaimed one of the boysi am sure mamma will let us support edith'smotion today and papa will give us somethingsupernaturalso be it children said mrs howardvampires consentingly and we will be unanimous inour petitions to papaagreed responded mr howard andi think i will give you some account of thevampires of which i dare say you haveoften heard and no oriental superstitionis more general or more disgusting than thebelief in shades or vampires a dead bodywill become a vampire it is said if for thefirst week after death it is exposed to theaction of the sun's rays and if forty daysare allowed to pass without the removal ofthe corpse from such a situation it is nolonger to be found among the dead butreceives its horrible mission to torment andto alarm the livingsome of the proceedings of the vampiresare more mischievous than wicked theypour vinegar into wine mix honey and mealtogether salt with sugar oil with butter but minor moralsthey also beat and sometimes are said tomurder their old acquaintances they appeareither in the character they had while aliveor assume the shape of an animal or evenwander about invisible upon the earthso little doubt attaches to the existenceof vampires that the cadi of a district isfrequently applied to for an islam or authorityto enable a chadedgi or vampirdgivampirehunter to visit burialplaces toexamine graves and to take any other measuresto discover and to defeat the machinations ofvampires these men profess to be giftedby means of certain herbs with the powerof tracking a vampire even when he is invisibleto others they act gratuitouslyrefusing all recompense but are bound notto communicate their unknown secrets to anybut their hereditary descendants the opiniongenerally maintained is that the chadedgi arevampires themselves descended from vampires on thepaternal side and it is an undoubted factthat in the districts where the vampires aremost common the vampirdgis are to be foundin the greatest numbers the remedy growswith the growth of the evilhaving obtained then authority fromthe cadi the vampirdgi sets out on a visitto all the tombs in the neighbourhood andsometimes undertakes a journey of manyleagues he discovers by arts unknown thetomb of the vampire and on the followingsaturday for it is only on saturday thatthe vampires are at home the vampirdgithe local authorities and crowds of peoplehasten to the place which is surrounded bymen on horseback each with a drawn sabrein his hand nobody can tell why thereare so many guards but so it is and underthe direction of the vampirdgi the grave is minor moralsopened and the body is always discovered the skin peeled ois the muscles fresh andred but swelled the hair and beard if it bethecorpse of a man considerably lengthenedthere is no disagreeable odour but the smellis solely that of newlyuncovered earth rememberthis is the account given by thepeople themselves the spectators all retireto some distance while the chadedgi drivesa pointed stake through the heart of thecorpse from whence there is always an emissionof blood the crowd then approach afuneral pile is prepared and the body withthe stake is burnt till they are both whollyconsumed and the ashes being deposited inthe grave the vampire can molest his neighboursno more the proceedings vary somewhatin different parts of the east those ihave described are exactly such as take placein the turkish provinces on the danubevampires illit is not an uncommon thing for agovernor at the request of a district toorder the burialplace to be changed whenit is suspected of being favourable to thecreation of vampires old ali pacha oftannin issued several such decrees and ihave known instances where the inhabitantsof whole villages have left their houses andpassed the night in the fields when it wassupposed a vampire had got into theirhabitationsat sees in macedonia there was avampire which created great disturbance heoften visited the house in which he had dweltwhen alive and amused himself by peltingthe persons he found in it with pigeon'sdung one day when there was a largecompany a daring young man bid defianceto the vampire told him to show himselfand challenged him to single combat he minor moralswas answered by a shower of pigeon's dungupon which he drew a pistol from his beltand fired at the spot whence the showerproceeded but great was everybody's astonishmentwhen instead of going directly tothe object the ball stopped in the middle ofthe room and fell perpendicularly down uponthe floor immediately quantities of dirt werehurled at the persons who were present andthey were obliged to fly from the placea vampirdgi was immediately sent forand he came accompanied by a crowd ofpeople placing himself in the middle ofthe court he wrote an inscription on a pieceof paper which he threw into the air whereit continued describing circles for more thanaquarter of an hour when it fell perpendicularlyto the ground the chadedgi immediatelydrove a staff with a sharp ironpoint through the paper and on lifting itvampires up a small frog was seen pierced throughby the iron a fire had been before kindledand in the midst of the fire he placed thestair the paper and the frog and when allwere consumed the ashes were collected takento the churchyard and buried and thevillage was never afterwards disturbed by thevampirea district celebrated for its number ofvampires is that of sarigueul in the neighbourhoodof japonica any one who likesto visit that part of macedonia might fill avolume with the stories he could collectthat which i am about to relate was relatedby the governor and verified by the muftiof modena who said that fifteen hundredpersons were willing to swear to the truthof the statementin the village of embord there diedsome years ago a greek peasant of the name minor moralsof marco loutclie he left a widow andtwo daughters aged eight and ten yearsone evening about three months after hisdeath while the woman and her children wereemployed in spinning flax by lamplightmarco appeared the door had not beenopened and they were naturally alarmed bythe presence of a man whom they at firstsupposed to be a robber but their alarm wasincreased tenfold when they perceived that theirvisitor was one of the dead that he was herhusband and their father but he spoke tothem in gentle tones declared he would dothem no harm that his visit was one ofaffection and that with their consent heproposed to pass every night in their companyhe said he should not come emptyhandedin future and in fact at his next visit hebrought them each a pair of loose trowserssuch as are worn by oriental women everyvampires evening something was added to their wardrobeor to their stock of culinary vare andhousehold furniture while in the village ofencore and the neighbouring villages nothingwas heard of but the robberies ofgarments chairs tables pots and pans andnobody could discover the thief not a wordwas said by the woman about their growingpossessions for in fact the vampire hadmenaced them with dreadful vengeance ifthey ever opened their lips on the subjectin other particulars the conduct of the vampirewas reprehensible and he was fond of talkingwith and caressing the girls after about amonth he had made himself quite at homein the house where he passed all his nightsbut departed at the dawn of day when hiswidow alarmed lest her conduct should bedeemed sinful determined to consult the papagreek priest of the parish and to ask his minor moralscounsel in so very embarrassing a state ofthings the papa recommended her to beprudent to avoid any quarrel but to endeavourto worm out from the vampire wherehe passed his time from sunrise to sunset as it would not be possible to destroy himin the churchyard he having been dead morethan forty days he even recommended herto welcome him to speak of him and acttowards him with all kindness and affectionand to employ every winning art in orderto ascertain where he went when he desertedher in the morning the widow managedit all with so much dexterity that after afew days she was able to communicate to thepriest that her husband passed his days inthe decayed trunk of a chestnuttree one ofseven or eight which grew at a short distancefrom the village on the northeast side acommunication was therefore made to thevampires local authorities and the usual permission wasgiven on the following saturday the peoplecollected and surrounded the trees but asnone of them were to appearance hollow itwas necessary to climb them and on the topof one of the trunks where it divided itselfinto branches a large hole was discoveredand in that hole a dead body standing erectexhaling no disagreeable odour whatever theceremonies which have been described tookplace the tree was cut down and burntwith the corpsea proclamation was issued throughout thedistrict that those who had lost anythingshould apply to the turkish commanderwho would restore their property to themhe said that a great many people demandedthings they had never lost and that themost violent disputes took place between thevarious claimants but he averred the exact minor moralstruth of the facts and added that the widowdeclared before the competent tribunal thatthe vampire was cold as death and that histouch was perfectly icyis it not very likely papa that thewidow was a receiver of stolen goods andthat on detection she invented the story ofthe vampire said georgethat may well be answered mr howard for i believe in nine cases out of ten thebelief in ghosts genii and vampires is usedin the east by clever rogues as a means ofcarrying on and of concealing their fraudulentdoingsmahomet all papa you have seen much of mahometali pacha will you tell us something abouthim where was he born was arthur'srequest to mr howard when next they allmet togetherhe was born at camilla in roumelia washis father's answer and he told me he wasthe youngest of sixteen children he wasmuch indulged by his father and mother andwas a great favourite of his brothers and sistershe once said to me do not wonder if i amsometimes impatient and want to have my ownway i was never used to contradiction ihave scarcely ever known misfortune i was minor moralsborn under a smiling star and that star hassmiled upon me all my life through but has not mahomet ali committed agreat many cruel deeds did he not inviteall the mamelukess to a festival and causethem to be murdered inquired georgeand i have heard added arthur thatone of them sprung with his fine arabhorse over the battlements of the high citadelof cairo and so saved his lifewhat you have heard is true said mrhoward and all that mahomet ali or hisfriends urge for his justification is that themamelukess were plotting against him andwould have destroyed him had he not destroyedthemwhat is meant by a mameluke papa asked editha mameluke my dear means a slavethe mameluke in the east is a whiteimahomet all person who was originally bought by a turkishmaster the mamelukess come from circassiaand georgia the morea and otherparts of the ottoman empire sometimesthey are sold by their parents sometimesthey are taken in war and there are casesin which they have become voluntary slavesof a mussulman master joseph when hewas sold by his brethren in syria to themidianite merchants was nothing but a mameluke and he rose to power in egyptunder pharaoh as hundreds have risen whoare now in the pacha's service commandinghis fleets and armies and occupying the veryhighest posts about his person and in hisgovernment a mameluke slave becomes apart of his master's family is fed and clothedby him and frequently gives evidence ofextraordinary attachment and devotion toadvance him in life is one of the greatvol iii g minor moralsobjects of his master's policy usually whena mameluke slave gets to a marriageableage a wife is found for him and he issometimes established independently of hisowner of the egyptians who have beensent to be instructed in europe many werepurchased in their boyhood by the pachaand his son it is seldom they know anythingof their parentage and i have often taken occasionto inquire how far the feelings ofaffection which children experience towardstheir parents could be transferred to strangersand to mastersdid you ever hear a mameluke tell thestory of his being kidnapped and of hissufferings and of wdiat he felt when he wastorn from his home asked edithyes i once got a bey who had acquireddistinction in the pacha's army torelate to me what he recollected of themahomet all history of his childhood and what he saidwas this the earliest thing i can rememberis a great mountain on the sideof which were many houses and at its foota river where a lady used to take me towalk i do not know how old i was ihave forgotten even the language i used tospeak but i remember we were severalboys and girls in the house brothers andsisters and we used to play together on agreen hill one day i heard that our fatherhad been quarrelling with a relation i hadseen him go out in the morning with hisarms and he never returned again i havea confused recollection that we were all mymother my brothers and my sisters carriedaway by persons whose faces i had neverbefore seen arid we were conveyed to tambourall this has left no stronger impressionson my mind than if i had dreamt it minor moralsso completely have oilier events erased itfrom my memory i know that i am acircassian for a few circassian words arestill left in my mind but of the name of thespot where i was born or that of my familyof even the faces of my brothers and sistersi have now no idea yet i have endeavouredagain and again to hear somethingof my early fate and that of my fatheri have described to every circassian mamelukei have met with all that i know ofmy birthplace and my family and i havelistened to their stories in return and ihave often fancied that their mountain wasmy mountain their river my river and theirvillage my village had they never hearda story resembling mine indeed suchstories are so common they are an everyday'stale there was nothing peculiar inmy fate and then my brother frommahomet all whom i was separated as soon as we reachedconstantinople i to be received into a noblefamily to be instructed in all the learningof the east to be taught the profoundestpolemics of islamism to be pushed forwardinto the highest seats but my brother he must have been older by a year or twothan i his riper memory would fill upheblanks of mine he would help me now theiri am rich and powerful to discover to revisitand to bless the little village in which wewere born how often has my heart yearnedwhen holding converse with a circassian mameluke how often has it occurred to meperhaps he even he is my brother yetnever but once never but once did i feelany light was thrown on my earlier daysand that was in upper egypt where i metwith a circassian hadji on a pilgrimage tothe holy cities with him i talked of minor moralsthe theme so dear to my heart to him idescribed all i knew of my native landand he exclaimed i know the place iknow it well but i never heard of yourfamily he told me i might be certainhe would busy himself about my concernswhen he returned from mekka he sworeby the prophet that i should hear i madehim repeat his oath by all that is holiestnot a word have i heard perhaps heperished in the desert perhaps he has neverreturned to circassia perhaps he has returnedand has learnt nothing perhapsafter a lapse of thirty years there was nothingto learn i have heard from our circassianwomen that people know little of one anotherin that country that busied in perpetualmisunderstandings and in petty warfare everyfamily has too many cares of its own to beoccupied with the cares and concerns ofmahomet all others still a voice within me is perpetuallycrying you will find your brotheryou will return to your native village you will see again the mountain the riverand the green hill and when the beyhad said this he hung down his head insilence and raised it in smiles when i saidyou will yet find your brother but we have forgotten mahomet allwhile talking of one of his beys i shouldtell you that mahomet ali was fortysixyears old before he had learned either toread or to write this he told me himselfi have heard that he was taught by hisfavourite wife but he is fond of readingnow and one day when i entered hisdivan unannounced i found him quite alonewith his spectacles on reading a turkishvolume which he was much enjoying whilea considerable pile of books were by his minor moralsside it is a pleasant relief lie said frompublic business i was reading some amusingturkish stories probably the arabiannights and now let us talk what haveyou to tell me there is a great deal ofsagacity in mahomet all's conversation particularlywhen he knows or discovers as heusually does the sort of information whichhis visitor is most able to give he discourseswith engineers about mechanical improvements with military men on the artof war with seaofficers on shipbuildingand naval manoeuvres with travellers onthe countries they have visited with politicianson public affairs he very willinglytalks of foreign countries and princes andstatesmen and is in the habit of mingling inthe conversation all sorts of anecdotes abouthimself and the events connected with hishistory his phrases are often poetical andmahomet alt he like most orientals frequently introduceproverbs and imagery i heard him oncesay speaking of the agriculture of egyptwhen i came to this country i onlyscratched it with a pin i have now succeededin cultivating it with a hoe butsoon i will have a plough passing over thewhole land you asked me george if hewere not a cruel prince and that he certainlyis not for many a generous deed hashe done and seldom will it be found thatthe reign of a turkish sovereign is so littlestained with bloodwe like to hear of acts of clemencysaid one of the children tell us of mahometall'swhen i was at cairo a number of levantinemerchants had got deeply and ifear dishonestly in debt to the pacha pay minor moralsment lead been urged in every possible waybut in vain at last the pacha got impatientfor the amount was large exceeding sterling and he directed them to beseized sent to the galleys for life and alltheir property to be confiscated it happenedthat an englishman of distinction and myselfwere applied to by their distressedfamilies to intercede with the pacha and toimplore mercy less on account of the imprudentdebtors than of their numerous familieswe urged the excess of punishmentwith reference to the offence falling uponthe innocent more heavily than on the guiltywe talked of the gentle quality of mercy blessing the giver as much as the receiver and the old man's heart was touched andhe forgave the debtorsi have heard you say that mahomet alimahomet alt is a very interesting person in his ownfamily now let us all know something ofhis private character said mrs howardi do not deny answered mr howardthat i feel a great interest in mahometali and the more so because i have hadthe advantage of seeing him with his childrenand grandchildren around him and oftalking with him about domestic mattersin the east it is very difficult to learnmuch about the private concerns of anyturk and still less of those of men of highstation mahomet ali's great pride is ibrahimpacha a victorious leader is always anobject of admiration among mussulmanss andibrahim pacha's career has been one of brilliantmilitary success his father is fond oftalking of his firstborn son and intended successori did not know him he said ihad not an unbounded confidence in him for minor moralsmany many years no not till ms beardwas almost as long as my own and evenchanging its colour said the pacha to mebut now i can thoroughly trust him onthe part of ibrahim pacha though in rankabove his father for the pacha of the holycities is the first pacha of the ottoman empirethere is always the utmost deferenceto mahomet all's will in the most difficultcircumstances of his life he has alwaysreferred to his renowned sire for adviceand whenever he has been pressed by therepresentatives of the great powders of europehe has invariably answered that he shouldabide by the instructions he received fromhis father of the sons of mahomet alitoussoun the second was long the favouritehe was a prince of a generous not to sayextravagant disposition and when on oneoccasion he was reproached by his father formahomet all his prodigality he answered it may bewell for you to be economical who were notborn what you are but i am the son ofmahomet ali pacha and the son of a pachamust be liberal his father smiled theanswer flattered his sense of dignity and heupbraided toussoun no more not long aftertoussoun died of the plague a third sonsnail was murdered by the blacks in sennathe hut in which he was being surroundedby brushwood set on fire and heperished in the flameshad they no motive the blacks had hedone nothing to deserve so cruel a fate inquired edithhe had invaded their country and awakenedtheir animosity and looking on him asan intruder they thus satiated their revengeand what happened in consequence asked george minor moralsthe slieikli or leader at sliendy wherethe deed was

inbarbarous countries is accompanied by horrorswhich happily in our days and among civilizednations have been modified or whollyput an end to but even now where it ragesin the east deeds are frequently done whichone cannot think of without shudderingvengeance acts with all its ferocity and totorture as well as to destroy an enemy isdeemed the right as it is the not unfrequentusage mutilations of the most frightful characterare still sanctioned and practised inthe ancient monuments of egypt the arrivalof immense quantities of human ears is demahometall picked and in one of the temples the kingis represented watching the turning over ofa large heap of ears while the scribe is recordingtheir numbers as they are reportedby persons employed in counting them tothis day such

forced to take part in insurrectionsfrom which they willingly would have keptaloof in the last war with the druses ofthe hauoran in syria the egyptian prisonerswho fell into their hands were sawedin pieces while yet alive i speak of suchthings unwillingly my children but i havetwo objects i wish you to know at what afrightful cost military reputations are oftenpurchased i wish you to know what war is minor moralsin order that you may hate it and thathating war you may cherish the spirit ofpeace seek peace on all occasions avoidthose passions whose unrestrained outbreakleads to such vice and such misery and especiallythat you should feel what a privilegewhat a blessing it is to have been born christiansand to have had your lot thrown upondays and among people who though theyretain somewhat of the warlike barbarisms andtendencies of past ages and distant realmshave undoubtedly made no small progress inthe career of humanity and now i will againspeak of mahomet ali and his family i have been very happy in my childrenhe said to me one day there is not one ofthem who does not treat me with the utmostdeference and respect except he addedlaughing outright that little fellow the lastand the least of all mahomet akmahomet alt he was then a boy of five or six yearsold called by lies father's name the son ofhis old age his benjamin his best beloved i see how it is i said your highnessspoils the boy you encourage the littlerogue mahomet ali laughed again it wasan acknowledgment of a little paternal weaknessnot long after i was in the palace ofshoubra it was on a friday the mussulmansabbath when the pacha is in the habit ofreceiving all his familyi found him in the centre of his divanhe was surrounded by all his sons and grandsonswho were then residing at cairo hehad been listening to the accounts of theirstudies of their amusements and their employmentsabbas pacha the eldest son oftoussoun pacha sat next his grandfatherand the rest of the family were seated on minor moralschairs according to their ranks and agesafter some conversation mahomet ali toldhis descendants that they might now withdrawone after another they rose kneltbefore him kissed the hem of his garmentand retired little mahomet ali came lasthe was dressed in military costing with asmall goldencased scimitar dangling at hisside he advanced towards his father lookedin his face he saw the accustomed theinvoluntary smile and when he was about ayard from the pacha instead of bending orsaluting him he turned on his heels andlaughingly scampered away like a yoimgcolt i see how it is said i to mahomet alithe old man shook his head lookedgrave for a moment another smile passedover his countenance pekin pekin saidhe in a low tone well well but imahomet all certainly did not like his highness theworse for what i had just witnessedchildren like to be talked to about childrenand they like especially to have thosewho are too exalted to be approachable bythemselves brought as it were into theirpresence and made intelligible to their understandings and now good night saidmr howard and the young people withdrewto dream about the great and the little mahometailmagiciansas george and arthur were walking in thegarden one said to the other let us askpapa if he saw the magician at cairo whothey say has so often shown absent peopleto his visitors and even brought into theircompany the exact likenesses of the dead he you mean answered george whobeing asked to exhibit lord nelson introducedthe image of lord nelson dressed likea naval officer and having lost one of hisarmsthat was indeed very strange we willinquire of papa how it can be explainedand after tea was over and the teamagicianstiling's removed george said to mr howardarthur and i were talking today aboutthe magician of cairo of whom we haveheard so much and we determined to askyou whether you had seen him and whetheryou can explain how he managed to convincehis visitors that he was able to summonthe absent and the dead into his presencei believe my boys answered mr howard that the magician would not havemuch success if his auditors understood arabicthoroughly if they were not themselvescredulous and if the professed sorcerer didnot so put his questions as to enable him toelicit the answer he wishes to obtain i didnot see him at cairo because he has been somuch exposed cf late and his failures havebeen so repeated that the interest felt inhis imposture has died away you know henever practises except on young people and minor moralsusually the ignorant and superstitious youngarabs who are called in from the streetsyou remember after having performed hisincantations he professes to show the reflectionof the persons whom it is wished to seein a small quantity of ink which he poursinto the hand of the young person heoperates on i know a case where an intelligentenglish lad was taken into the presenceof the magician and after he had madehis preparations and filled the boy's palmwith ink he asked him whether he saw anythingthe boy looked and looked saidno nothing at first but at last criedout o yes o yes i see i see something upon which all the company criedout in great excitement ancr'what whatclo yousee i see said the boy i seemy ovn nose now i believe that the lads who o tomagicians the magician now merely see their ownnoses or such things as they are led tofancy they see by the leading questionswhich the magicians ask i will tell you astory however which i heard from a veracioussource and which will show you whatstrong credulity may do in deceiving thesensesa young mussulman had visited mekkawhile quite a lad and had obtained in consequencethe title of hadji he was onlytwelve years old when he went to the holycity in company with his father and hesaid he should undoubtedly have died notso much from fatigue as from a perpetualsorrowing after his mother and sister whomhe passionately loved had not a pilgrimfrom morocco who turned out to be a magiciancome to his relief i will tell hisstory in his own words minor morals my father and i left yakova ournative town for japonica on our way to theholy city my heart sunk within me atparting with my mother and sister but thenovelty of the journey sometimes turned mythoughts away from objects so inexpressiblydear to me but in our passage from samonicato alexandria when there was nothingto engage or direct my attention every hournot passed in sleep and many many weremy waking hours was occupied in thinkingof those i had left behind happily thevoyage only lasted six days and the greatcities of alexandria and cairo so unlikeanything i had seen afforded me much amusementand enjoyment and served for a littletime to relieve me from the grief with whichmy bosom was filled but as we travelledto coster the desire to see my mother andmy sister occupied all my mind so thatmagicians when we reached the red sea i could containmy feelings no longer but gave wayto the bitterest weeping at the thought thatanother sea was to roll between me and thosei so tenderly loved and so earnestly desiredto see a deep melancholy overcame meand i fell seriously ill being unable eitherto eat drink or sleep i had been fourdays in this state at coster when myfather received the visit of a morocco pilgrimwhose acquaintance we had made atcairo where we had inhabited the samehouse seeing that my father was much outof spirits he inquired the reason and wastold of my illness and its cause whichillness was not only in itself a source ofaffliction but was likely to prevent our departurein the djedda vessels which were tosail in a very few days the pilgrim at onceproposed to undertake my cure and to showvol iii h minor moralsme my mother and my sister but as theallowing a stranger to see a mahommedanwoman is contrary to our laws my fathermade many objections fearing that if seenby me they would be seen by the pilgrimalso but his great anxiety about his onlyson and his desire to accomplish his pilgrimageinduced him to give his consenti was taken from my bed and dressedthe pilgrim lighted a charcoal fire anddirected that i should not open my lips orstretch out my hands to the persons whomight appear my father sat on one side ofme and our servant on the other thepilgrim took a piece of paper wrote aninscription on it and threw it on the burningcoals uttering some words in a low tone and hardly was the paper consumed ere mymother and my sister appeared in the middleof the chamber smiling on me most sweetlymagicians i felt no alarm but lead great difficulty inrestraining myself from rushing into theirarms they remained there for severalminutes and not being able to resist i endeavouredto rush forward when my fathercaught me by the waist and i cried outmother mother speak to me and atthat moment the vision disappeared themagician scowled upon me terribly and myfather gave me a violent cuff on the eari should have been in a state of despair butthe magician promised to repeat the incantationthe next day he was indeed mylife and i entreated him to come and dwellwith us as he only could console or saveme the next day before he began theceremonies he made me swear on thekoran that i would keep still which i religiouslydid my health began to improve minor moralshe allowed me to see my mother and sistertwice after and i became perfectly wellthe power of superstition continued mrhoward and the universality of the belief inthe presence of genii mingling themselves inmortal affairs may be traced by any inquireri will mention a circumstance that occurredto a european gentleman at janina he hadvisited said ahmet effendi and pipes andcoffee were being brought in when a violentnoise was heard probably from ratsunder the floor what is this said

much credulity inthe character of the frenchman i am surehis veracity cannot be called in question our own countrymen have shown suchincredible credulity when speaking of theegyptian magicians that i

cadi el giiechant he was born at bagdad though hisusual abode was damascus his intercoursewith supernatural spirits was notorious andafter many urgent entreaties on my part heconsented to bring a djin into my presenceas i had expressed an intense desire to seeone of these beings of whom i had heard somuch he gave me a few words on a scrapof paper and ordered me to repeat them onehundred times before i went to bed onthree following nights i did punctually ashedirected me not however expecting thatanything would come of my obedience isaw nothing either on the first second or thirdnight and went to the sheikh to inform himthat he had not succeeded in his arrangementshe told me that what had been done wasonly the preliminary step but that i should seeh minor moralsthe djln in a human shape the followingnight in a vision after i had followed hisinstructions he then wrote a single wordupon another piece of paper told me to repeatit three hundred times before i went tobed and then to place the paper under mypillow you wil hear a loud voice hesaid calling to you on the opposite side tothat where the djin will appear and it willsay behold the djin and the namewhich is under your

me that i have notseen what i know i have seenin march the exhibition i amabout to describe took place in the town ofnapoli de romaniaa jewish boy of the age of fifteenwho was employed at the customhouse declaredthat he was persecuted by a djinwho haunted him in all directions all sortsof exorcisms were tried in vain there wasat this time a magician at napoli calledkizitlu effendi who had studied the occultsciences at fez in barbary and he wascalled upon to practice his art on behalf ofthe jewish boy for mussulmanss christiansand jews in the east are about equallycredulous a large company of turks andjews were assembled to see the magicianexhibit his influence soon after the boymagicians entered the room and the magician beganhis conjurations when the lad was seizedwith a sudden and violent trembling andbeing asked the cause of his fears he saidhe saw a negro who looked at him in amost threatening way kizitlu effendi directedthe boy to inquire of the negro inwhat he had offended him and why he persecutedhim upon which the negro answeredthat he was a djin and that inpassing under the window of the boy'shouse he had committed towards him a veryindecent act drenched him and that he haddetermined to be revenged the magicianintreated the negro to desist and to forgivethe boy but he could not succeed uponwhich he exhibited all the powers of hisart and by long and elaborate conjurationshe forced the monarch of the genii dineparish to appear he came with a very minor moralsnumerous and brilliant attendance but theywere only visible to the young jew whocarried on the conversation as directed bythe magician he addressed many complimentsto the prince on his gracious appearanceand having reported the stubbornnessof the negro entreated his majesty to consentto the cure of the jewish boy themonarch ordered the negro to be broughtin for he had hurried away on the entranceof his sovereign and immediately one of theattendants disappeared and soon came backaccompanied by the negro the negrobent himself to the ground before his sovereignbut still resolutely persisted in hisdetermination to persecute the boy uponwhich the king ordered in the executionerwho severed the negro's head from his bodyand the boy was instantaneously restored tohealth he has frequently been examinedmagicians by travellers and persists in the truth of hisstory more than thirty persons were presentat the above scene who are unanimousin the belief that everything passed whichi have spoken of and the boy himself undoubtedlybelieved it in an excited anddiseased state of mind receiving all the impressionsof ignorance and credulity attributingto supernatural agency consequenceswhich medical art might readily explain theonly real imposter being the magician whoby the dexterous management of leadingquestions and pictures presented to the boy'smind soon filled a childish fancy with allthe chimeras of his own imaginationthe albanians in the pursuit of hiddentreasures have long been in the habit of usingcandles made of human fat stuck upon acurved hazel stick they say that the candlesgo out with an explosion whenever the minor moralsholder of it approaches any spot where moneyis concealedbut it is not always that the most celebratedof magicians can exercise authorityover the djins mahomet effendi the kiayaof ali pacha was a man of great accomplishmentsand some philosophical knowledgebut he had not been able to rid himself ofthe superstitions of his countrymen and thepalace in which he lived in albania washaunted by djins he did indeed at onetime suspect that the stories told him weretricks of the servants to get possession of thebest apartments of the palace which wereabandoned by the family and not offered toguests of distinction on account of the disturbanceswhich often were created in them by thedjins once he went with his son to ascertainwhether the report which had reachedhim was true that the djins were throwingmagicians about the furniture and flinging stones intothe principal room his son preceded himand had no sooner entered than his turbanwas snatched off and flung into the effendi'sface son and father retreated in no smallhurry he spent large sums in bringingmagicians sheikhs and dervishes to exorcisehis palace but the djins were toowell satisfied with their abode to surrenderit to anybody

mussulmanas an act of acceptable homage to thedeity but among the very ostentatious andfanatical turks chaplets of five hundred oreven a thousand beads are sometimes used betokening by the multitude of their prayersthe superiority of their piety the two magicianshad chaplets of this unusual sizeintended to give weight to their saintly characteras soon as they entered the chamberof the djins they took their chaplets out oftheir bosoms when lo they were suddenlymagicians snatched away and somewhat taken by surpriseat so unexpected a reception theydetermined to defer the exorcisms to the followingday and betook themselves to sleepnext day when they came down stairs theirfaces and beards were found unknown tothemselves to have been powdered with quicklimeand in the room are still

examplesof that extremely flagitious character whichwere so common formerly i will give yousome particulars of one of the worst oppressorsand most cruel governors of thelast generation the former pacha of acreor akka as it is called by the arabs anddjezzar pacha which as you perhaps know is the ptolemaicof the new testamentdjezzar pacha whose name which heconferred upon himself signifies butcher wasone of the most execrable of modern despotsand yet he had the reputation of being agreat warrior and at acre i heard a veryold man with a long white beard speak ofhim with affection and seek to counterbalancethe history of his atrocities by recountingdeeds of generosity and valour hemurdered men it is true by wholesale incold blood but he built a beautiful mosquean extensive bath and a delightful fountainfor the people there were no bounds tohis savage ferocity yet his tomb bears alaudatory inscription and though more thanaquarter of a century is passed since hisdeath upon that

the world as if to teach ushow very wicked a human being may becomewho lets his evil passions get the upper handand who has power enough to exercise thesepassions without control perhaps evendjezzar pacha was not quite so bad as hewas thought to be one of his attendantstold me that he once murdered one hundredand forty prisoners with his own hand butwhat is quite certain is that in a fit of jealousyhe drowned all the women of hisdjezzar pacha harem and decapitated his mamelukess inthe same day and i was told on the spotthat the number of persons who were destroyedon this occasion was between seventyand eighty he spared only two personsand they succeeded him in the pachalikand were distinguished for their humanityin the streets of st john d'acre mutilatedpersons are frequently seen i made therethe acquaintance of the son of his secretaryand he told me djezzar pacha had cut offhis father's nose and that there were fewpersons about him who had not been mutilatedeither by himself

systemit would be difficult observed mrhoward to say whether wisdom ind goodnessare exhibited most in those points inwhich men resemble or in which they differfrom one another out of their resemblancetheir sympathies grow and yet if the resemblancewere so complete as to preventsincerity with prudence persons from being easily distinguished whatconfusion and embarrassment there would bein the world i am often amused continued mr howardat the different and contrasted viewsmen take of the same objects society wouldbe very dull if the same thoughts occurredto every mind alike on the same occasion mr howard liked to throw out remarkssuch as this in order to give his childrenthe opportunity of applying them to subjectswhich had occupied their attentioni have just been reading a curious instancein point said georgelet us hear it then your repeating itwill impress it on your memorythe spanish ambassador on his introductionto henry the ivth of france saidhe was very anxious to ascertain the chasiii l minor moralsracteristic qualities of his ministers youshall judge of them yourself said the kinghe first called silvery his chancellor andsaid mr chancellor there's a beam

me but echoessincerity with prudence back what lie fancies is my opinion jeaninthinks like a wise man and speaks likean honest onevery much to the purpose said mrhoward and a lesson too on the value ofsincerity in the presence of superiors menfrequently get into the habit of shaping theirexpressions to the supposed opinions of thosesuperiors it is natural enough as likeloves like according to an old phrase thata similarity of sentiment should be acceptableand yet different and even opposed opinionsmay be so expressed as to give nopain whatever the true art of conversationis to blend sincerity with courtesy neverto sacrifice truth but to wound as little aspossible the selflove of others there ismuch in manner there is much in tonetannin's speech was not wanting in respector it would not have excited as it did the minor moralsapplause of the king it is an instructiveexample of courteous frankness and sinceritytoo now i will show you in a descriptionof two persons whom i know very well thecontrast between the frankness that takes acourteous and that which takes an uncourteousformmr sharp is a man of considerableability he was admirably educated and bycontinuing to read the best books that arewritten and by mingling with the best societyof his neighbourhood he never talksbut to give information and it is impossibleto consult him on any topic without beingbenefited by the information he communicatesand he is really and at heart akind and benevolent man he gives hismoney liberally to all good purposes hewill take much trouble to oblige and ishonest in all his intentions and upright in allsincerity with prudence his conduct but lie has manners so repulsivehis forms of expression have so muchacerbity he seems so bent on appearing ungraciousthat his good qualities have not halfthe influence nor do they produce a hundredthpart of the happiness they might beexpected to do he does the most agreeablethings disagreeably and if a disagreeablething is to be done by him he makes ittenfold worse by the tone and manner whichhe assumes i have heard poor people saythey had rather have mr goodman's refusalthan mr sharp's consent they had ratherfail with mr goodman than succeed with mrsharpmr goodman is mr sharp's friend andneighbour with less talent and far lessinstruction than mr sharp he has tentimes his influence everything he says hesays so graciously and kindly everything minor moralshe does is so characterized by a regard tothe feelings of others that he is an objectof universal affection to those aroundhim his experience of the world has enabledhim to appreciate the true excellencesof mr sharp's character to pass charitablyoverthe harshness of his manners and toavail himself of the soundness of his mindin this way he really uses mr sharp's influenceas well as his own for their intimacyleads to a constant communion between themmr goodman tolerates and passes by unnoticedexpressions such as those which have createdfor mr sharp a host of enemies mr sharpis known by the title of the disagreeableman whenever he speaks there is a dispositionto dislike him truth itself from hislips loses half its value and beneficence itselfhalf its recommendation i recollect acase in pointsincerity with prudence a cottage belonging to a poor man hadbeen destroyed by fire owing to the poorman's imprudence he bad fallen asleephaving in his mouth a lighted pipe whichfell and ignited a bundle of straw that wasnear him so that he had some difficulty inescaping and enabling his wife to escapethe next morning mr sharp called withthe purpose really of relieving and assistingthe poor man a lecture on imprudencemight have been a proper thing at a propertime but at a moment when the poor manhad received so terrible a lesson and whenhe was reduced to destitution by hisown fault it was not kind nor thoughtfulin mr sharp to speak reproachfully to thesufferers but his first words were thomas you careless fellow upon which thomaswhose heart was big enough to burst before minor moralsreplied o sir and wringing ms handsran away from the scene of his calamities itwas in fact more than he could bear and hispoor wife overwhelmed with their common miseryand thinking how needless it was to addto it by any reproaches said in tones loudenough to be heard hardhearted man now though mr sharp was really a charitableman and had come to the cottagersfor the purpose of serving them his pridetook offence at conduct and expressions whichhe thought insulting to him and he walkedmorosely though not angrily awaythomas returned to the ruins of his cottagewhich mr sharp had left i haveoffended him he said to his wife i havedone so ten times more she answered fori could not bear his unkindness it wasenough to lose our all it was enough tosincerity with prudence have no bed to rest upon no roof to restunder but why did lie abuse us thepoor my children have their pride as wellas the rich and it sometimes breaks forthmost violently in the moments of their utterdestitution thomas and his wife shed bittertears each repeating to the other heneeded not have added to our misery there were many persons grouped roundthe cottages they had heard mr sharp'swords and had seen him walk away aloud murmur followed him a low groan ofreprobation and yet as i told you he camewith the kindest of intentions the infirmityof temper thwarted them all onehasty word one little incident turned thewhole current of his friendly thought andcondemned him to the severest judgment ofthe slanders byand yet mr sharp was fond of popularl minor moralsapplause but his failings often subjected himas in this instance to popular reprobationmr goodman happened to pass by soonafter he did not come with any purposeof helping the sufferers from the fire buthe saw many people collected and he heardhis friend mr sharp spoken of in mostopprobrious terms he knew they were undeservedin fact as always happens whathad passed had been terribly exaggeratedmr sharp was accused of all sorts of inhumanityand it seemed as if every one wereoccupied in choosing the worst words of reproachto which their lips could give utterance what does all this mean asked mrgoodman and a hundred answers told himof mr sharp's cruelty to the cottagersnow this is impossible said he to thecrowd mr sharp is an excellent and mostslncehlty with prudence humane man sometimes a little harsh in hismanner of speaking but always endeavouringand intending to do right i am surehe never meant any unkindness but all mrgoodman's words were wasted you judgeothers by yourself the people answered butthey continued towards mr sharp their sentenceof condemnation and all appeals allreasonings were in vainmr sharp suffered so much in the publicopinion from this incident that he lost avery honourable public situation to which hehad been called by his fellow citizens andfor which in truth he was admirably fittedby talent and studybut was he not most hardly used inquiredarthur indeed he was repliedmr howard but i have narrated the circumstanceto you in order that you may seewhat annoying consequences may grow out minor moralsof a small defect i told you that mr sharpwas ambitious he got the fame of being disagreeableand i am sorry to say he is nowan unhappy man jv treasure seekingin the levantbut when are we to have some morestories about the

wordsof the narrator a ragusan captain wellknown in the east i am in the habit of trading with alexandriain egypt some time ago i knew ajewish tailor there who spoke italian tolerablywell and frequently acted as myinterpreter so that wee became friends onaccount of the services he rendered mebut on arriving at alexandria after one ofmy voyages i sought in vain for my hebrewacquaintance and was told he wassettled at canea in candia it happenedsome time after this that i had a cargo forthat port and i inquired about the fate andfortunes of my friend his jewish brethrentold me that he and all his family were retreasureseeking in the levant duce to extreme poverty and that theirmisery had been heightened by a stroke ofthe palsy with which the poor man hadbeen attacked i sought his abode andfound him a wretched cripple having lostthe use of all his limbs though his sensescontinued perfect his wife and his two sonsof the ages of fourteen and fifteen exhibitedthe same marks of having been smitten bythe palsy and his only daughter of sevenyears old had alone escaped the generalmisery a poor old jewess was paid by thejewish community of canea for serving thisunhappy family i inquired what had happenedto him since he left egypt and iheard from his own lips as follows i left alexandria in the hope of betteringmy condition and when i had settledhere some of my brethren told me that ihad been most lucky in the choice of my minor moralshouse for it was well known there was treasurehidden under the staircase i was only a tenantso i got together all my means made a liberaloffer for its purchase to the tuik who wasits owner which he accepted myself mywife and sons then set diligently aboutremoving the earth under the staircaseafter digging down some feet we discovereda large black slabstone which we raisedwith incredible toil and trouble and at ashort distance beneath it we perceived thelid of a chest but as we approached it itbegan to descend and descended deeper anddeeper as we dug i called out to myeldest son to get ropes and poles so thatwe might be able to seize and to lift thechest and from the moment that the ladwent in search of them the chest remainedstationary and sunk no more but as it wasa little below the surface of the groundtreasureseeking in the levant we could not get hold of it my son arrivedwith the poles and the ropes and webegan to dig holes by the sides of thechest in order that we might pass the ropesunder it and so raise it up but we hadscarcely commenced operations ere the chestsunk down again and all our efforts werevain i grew red and mad with rage andswore that neither ghost nor devil shoulddeprive me of the treasure my wife andchildren repeated my exclamations and weset to work with greater ardour than beforewhen lo the chest sunk down with a dreadfulcrash and a hideous monster in theshape of a huge toad looked out of thehole what happened next i know not butwe were all found the next morning palsystruckand in the state in which you nowsee us here the jew finished his narrativeand i gave him some money for his imme minor moralsdate wants but being somewhat incredulousi asked him if he would allow me tovisit the place and to try my own fortunethere at first he resisted violently but isucceeded in obtaining his consent i wenton board my ship and landed again accompaniedby four of my best sailors havingbrought a strong windlass on shore webegan to dig under the staircase at oneo'clock in the afternoon when we had dugabout three feet down we perceived a blackflagstone which we raised after very greatexertions and digging lower down we perceivedthe cover of the chest in the verycentre of which was a large ring to whichwe fastened a stout rope without any oppositionor
