some unaccountablemistake was the cause of his loss hesaw at once that the senate was master of the personof his bride and he too well knew its powerand its utter disregard of human obligations whenany paramount interest of the state was to be consultedto doubt for an instant its willingness to useits advantage in any manner that was most likely tocontribute to its own views by the prematuredeath of her uncle donna violetta had become theheiress of vast estates in the dominions of the churchand a compliance with that jealous and arbitrary lawof venice which commanded all of its nobles todispose of any foreign possessions they might acquirewas only suspended on account of her sexand as has already been seen with the hope of disposingof her hand in a manner that would provemore profitable to the republic with this objectstill before them and with the means of accomplishthebravo ing it in their own hands the bridegroom well knewthat his marriage would not only be denied but hefeared the witnesses of the ceremony would be sodisposed of as to give little reason ever to expectembarrassment from their testimony for himselfpersonally he felt less apprehension though he foresawthat he had furnished his opponents with an argumentthat was likely to defer to an indefinite periodif it did not entirely defeat his claims to thedisputed succession but he had already made uphis rind to this result though it is probable that hispassion for violetta had not entirely blinded him tothe fact that her roman signories would be nounequal offset for the loss he believed that he mightpossibly return to his palace with impunity so far asany personal injury was concerned for the greatconsideration he enjoyed in his native land and thehigh interest he possessed at the court of romewere sufficient pledges that no open violence wouldbe done him the chief reason why his claim hadbeen kept in suspense was the wish to profit by hisnear connexion with the favorite cardinal and thoughhe had never been able entirely to satisfy the everincreasingdemands of the council in this respecthe thought it probable that the power of the vaticanwould not be spared to save him from any very imminentpersonal hazard still he had given the stateof venice plausible reasons for severity and libertyjust at that moment was of so much importancethat he dreaded falling into the hands of the officialsas one of the greatest misfortunes which could momentarilyovertake him he so well knew thecrooked policy of those with whom he had to dealthat he believed he might be arrested

gelsomina opened theouter door for the admission of her visitor at thefirst sound of the latter s voice jacopo who hadlittle suspected the fact from a name which was socommon recognized the artful daughter of thewinesellerthou art at thy ease here gelsomina criedthe latter entering and throwing herself into a seatlike one fatigued thy mother is better and thouart truly mistress of the house the

confessor but authority is dear towoman and so is liberty thou wast not with themaskers yesterday in the square i seldom wear a disguise and i could not quitmy motherwhich means that thou w r ould st have been gladto do it thou hast good reason for thy regretssince a gayer marriage of the sea or a braverregatta has not been witnessed in venice sincethou wast born but the first was to be seen fromthy windowi saw the galley of state sweeping toward thelido and the train of patricians on its deck butlittle elseno matter thou shalt have as good an ideaof the pageant as if thou had st played the part ofthe doge himself first came the men of the guardwith their ancient dresses nay this i remember to have often seen forthe same show is kept from year to yearthou art right but venice never witnessedsuch a brave regatta thou knowest that the firsttrial is always between gondolas of many oarssteered by the best esteemed of the canals luigiwas there and though he did not win he more thanmerited success by the manner in which he directedhis boat thou knowest luigi i scarce know any in venice annina for thelong illness of my mother and this unhappy officethe bravo of my father keep me within when others are onthe canalstrue thou art not well placed to make acquaintancesbut luigi is second to no gondolierin skill or reputation and he is much the merriestrogue of them all that put foot on the lidohe was foremost then in the grand racehe should have been but the awkwardness ofhis fellows and some unfairness in the crossingthrew him back to be second twas a sight tobehold that of many noble watermen struggling tomaintain or to get a name on the canals santamaria i would thou could st have seen it girl i should not have been glad to see a frienddefeatedwe must take fortune as it offers but the most ilwonderful sight of the day after all though luigiand his fellows did so well was to see a poor fishermannamed antonio in his bare head and nakedlegs a man of seventy years and with a boat nobetter than that i use to carry liquors to the lidoentering on the second race and carrying off theprizehe could not have met with powerful rivals the best of venice though luigi havingstrived for the first could not enter for the secondtrial tis said too continued annina lookingabout her with habitual caution that one who mayscarce be named in venice had the boldness to appearin that regatta masked and yet the fishermanwon thou hast heard of jacopothe name is commonthere is but one who bears it now in veniceall mean the same when they say jacopoi have heard of a monster of that name surelyhe hath not dared to show himself among the nobleson such a festa gessina we live in an unaccountable country e the bravothe man walks the piazza with a step as lordly asthe doge at his pleasure and yet none say aught tohim i have seen him at noonday leaning againstthe triumphal mast or the column of san teodorowith as proud an air as if he were put there tocelebrate a victory of the republic perhaps he is master of some terrible secretwhich they fear he will reveal thou knowest little of venice child holymaria a secret of that kind is a deathwarrant ofitself it is as dangerous to know too much as itis to know too little when one deals with st markbut they say jacopo was there standing eye to eyewith the doge and scaring the senators as if he hadsheen an uncalled spectre from the vaults of theirfathers nor is this all as i crossed the lagunesthis morning i saw the body of a young cavalierdrawn from the water and those who were near itsaid it had the mark of his fatal hand the timid gelsomina shudderedthey who rule she said will have to answerfor this negligence to god if they let the wretchlonger go at largeblessed st mark protect his children

moved swiftly to a window and lookingout his eye fell upon a narrow and gloomy canalcrossing the gallery he cast a glance beneath himand saw the same dark w t watery passage leading bethebravo tween the masonry of two massive piles to the quayand the portgelsomina he cried recoiling from the sight this is the bridge of sighs it is carlo hast thou ever crossed it beforenever nor do i understand

was a transient gleam of distrust in thehasty glance of the bravo as he shot a look at theundisturbed eye of the innocent being who put thisquestion but it scarcely remained long enough tochange the expression of manly interest she wasaccustomed to meet in his looksince thou wilt have me curious he said whyhast thou come hither and more than all being herewhy dost thou lingerthe season is

much it would pain the sensitive andfaithful being who had yielded her affections to himwith a singleness and devotion which arose nearlyas much from her manner of life as from naturalingenuousnessin

swift buteasy movementdeceit like the windings of that subtle animal thefox often crosses its own path it consequentlythrows out those by whom it is practised as wellas those who are meant to be its victims whenjacopo parted from don camillo it was with an understandingthat he should adopt all the means thathis native sagacity or his experience might suggestto ascertain in what manner the council intended todispose of the person of donna violetta they hadseparated on the lido and as none knew of their the bravointerview but him and none would probably suspecttheir recent alliance the bravo entered on his newduty with some chances of success that might otherwisehave been lost a change of its agents in affairsof peculiar delicacy was one of the ordinarymeans taken by the republic to avoid investigationjacopo had often been its instrument in negotiatingwith the mariner who as has been so plainly intimatedhad frequently been engaged in carrying intoeffect its secret and perhaps justifiable measures ofpolice but in no instance had it ever been foundnecessary to interpose a second agent between thecommencement and the consummation of its bargainsexcept in this he had been ordered to seethepadrone and to keep him in preparation for immediateservice but since the examination of antoniobefore the council his employers had neglectedto give him any farther instructions the dangerof leaving the bride within reach of the agents ofdon camillo was so obvious that this unusual cautionhad been considered necessary it was underthis disadvantage therefore that jacopo entered onthe discharge of his new and important dutiesthat cunning as has just been observed is apt tooverreach itself has passed into a proverb and thecase of jacopo and his employers was one in pointto prove its truth the unusual silence of those whoordinarily sought him on similar occasions had notbeen lost on the agent and the sight of the feluccaas he strayed along the quays gave an accidentaldirectionto his inquiries the manner in whichthey were aided by the cupidity of the calabriahas just been relatedjacopo had no sooner touched the quay and securedhis boat than he hastened

spent the night in those places of amusementwere masked the step of the bravo thoughso unhesitating was leisurely and he found time inpassing up the piazzetta to examine the forms andwhen circumstances permitted the features of allhe met he proceeded in this manner to the pointof junction between the two squares when his elbowwas touched by a light handjacopo was not accustomed unnecessarily totrust his voice in the square of st mark and at thathour but his look of inquiry was returned by a signto follow he had been stopped by one whosefigure was so completely concealed by a dominoas to baffle all conjecture concerning his true characterperceiving however that the other wishedto lead him to a part of the square that was vacantand which was directly on the course he was

was making this protestation ofloyalty the latter was compelled to give vent to therest of his indignation in a soliloquyone of the tendencies of oppression is to createa scale of tyranny descending from those who rule the bravoa state to those who domineer over a single individualhe who has been much accustomed toview men need not be told that none are so arrogantwith their inferiors as those who are oppressed bytheir superiors for poor human nature has a secretlonging to revenge itself on the weak for all the injuriesit receives from the strong on the otherhand no class is so willing to render that deferencewhen unexpected which is the proper meed of virtueand experience and intelligence as he who knowsthat he is fortified on every side against innovationson his natural rights thus it is that there is moresecurity against popular violence and popular insultsin these free states than in any other country onearth for there is scarcely a citizen so debased asnot to feel that in assuming the appearance of a wishto revenge the chances of fortune he is making anundue admission of inferioritythough the torrent may be pent and dammed byart it is with the constant hazard of breaking downthe unnatural barriers but left to its own course itwill become the tranquil and the deep stream untilit finally throws off its superfluous waters into thecommon receptacle of the

stiletto claim andwhat more lovely exercise of our authority than tomake public an act of severe and muchrequiredjusticethe old senators bowed to this sentiment of theircolleague which was uttered

examinationwill enlighten us much on the course whichpolicy may dictatethere can be but one policy when the protectionof the lives of our citizens is in question i havenever before felt impatience to shorten the life ofman but in this trial i can scarce brook delayyour honorable impatience shall be gratifiedsignor soranzo for foreseeing the urgency of thecase my colleague the worthy senator who is joinedwith us in this high duty and myself have alreadyissued the commands necessary to that object the the bravohour is near and we will repair to the chamber ofthe inquisition in time to our dutythe discourse then turned on subjects of a moregeneral concern this secret and extraordinarytribunal which was obliged to confine its meetingsto no particular place which could decide on itsdecrees equally in the piazza or the palace amidstthe revelries of the masquerade or before the altar in the assemblies of the gay or in their own closetshad of necessity much ordinary matter submitted toits inspection as the chances of birth entered intoits original composition and god hath not madeall alike fit for so heartless a duty it sometimeshappened as in the present instance that the moreworldly of its members had to overcome the generousdisposition of a colleague before the action ofthe terrible machine could go onit is worthy of remark that communities alwaysestablish a higher standard of justice and truth thanis exercised by their individual members the reasonis not to be sought for since nature hath left toall a perception of that right which is abandonedonly under the stronger impulses of personal temptationwe commend the virtue we cannot imitatethus it fe that those countries in which public opinionhas most influence are always of the purest publicpractice it follows as a corollary from this propositionthat a representation should be as real as possiblefor its tendency will be inevitably to elevatenational morals miserable indeed is the conditionof that people whose maxims and measures of publicpolicy are below the standard of its private integrityfor the fact not only proves it is not the masterof its own destinies but the still more dangeroustruth that the collective power is employed in thefatal service of undermining those very qualitieswhich are necessary to virtue and which haveenough to do at all times in resisting the attacks ofthe bravo immediate selfishness a strict legal representationof all its interests is far more necessary to a worldlythan to a simple people since responsibility whichis the essence of a free government is more likelyto keep the agents of a nation near to its own standardof virtue than any other means the commonopinion that a republic cannot exist without an extraordinarydegree of virtue in its citizens is so flatteringto our own actual condition that we seldomtake the trouble to inquire into its truth but to usit seems quite apparent that effect is here mistakenfor the cause it is said as the people are virtuallymasters in a republic that the people ought to bevirtuous to rule well so far as this proposition isconfined to degrees it is just as true of a republic asof any other form of government but kings dorule and surely all have not been virtuous and thataristocracies have ruled with the very minimum ofthat quality the subject of our tale sufficiently showsthat other things being equal the citizens of a republicwill have a higher standard of private virtuethan the subjects of any other form of governmentis true as an effect we can readily believe for responsibilityto public opinion existing in all thebranches of its administration that conventionalmorality which characterizes the common sentimentwill be left to act on the mass and will not beperverted into a terrible engine of exemption as isthe case when factitious institutions give a falsedirection to its influencethe case before us was in proof of the truth ofwhat has here been said the signer soranzowas a man of great natural excellence of characterand the charities of his domestic circle had assistedin confirming his original dispositions likeothers of his rank and expectations he had fromtime to time made the history and polity of theselfstyled republic his study and the power of coltsthe bravoelective interests and specious necessities had madehim admit sundry theories which presented in anotherform he would have repulsed with indignationstill the signor soranzo was far from understandingthe full effects of that system which hewas born to uphold even venice paid that homageto public opinion of which there has just been questionand held forth to the world but a false pictureof her true state maxims still many of those whichwere too apparent to be concealed were difficultof acceptance with one whose mind was yet untaintedwith practice and the young senator rathershut his eyes on their tendency or as he felt theirinfluence in every interest which environed himbut that of poor neglected abstract virtue whoserewards were so remote he was fain to seek outsome palliative or some specious and indirect goodas the excuse for his acquiescencein this state of mind the signor soranzo was unexpectedlyadmitted a member of the council ofthree often in the daydreams of his youth hadhe contemplated the possession of this very irresponsiblepower as the consummation of his wishesa thousand pictures of the good he would performhad crossed his brain and it was only as he advancedin life and came to have a near view of thewiles which beset the bestintentioned that he couldbring himself to believe most of that which he meditatedwas impracticable as it was he enteredinto the council with doubts and misgivings hadhe lived in a later age under his own system modifiedby the knowledge which has been a consequenceof the art of printing it is probable that thesignor soranzo would have been a noble in oppositionnow supporting with ardor some measure ofpublic benevolence and now yielding gracefully tothe suggestions of a sterner policy and always influencedby the positive advantages he w r as born tothe bravo possess though scarcely conscious himself he wasnot all he professed to be the fault however wasnot so much that of the patrician as that of circumstanceswhich by placing interest in opposition toduty lures many a benevolent mind into still greaterweaknessesthe companions of the signer soranzo howeverhad a more difficult task to prepare him forthe duties of the statesman which were so verydifferent from those he was accustomed to performas a man than they had anticipated they werelike two trained elephants of the east possessingthemselves all the finer instincts and generous qualitiesof the noble animal but disciplined by a forcequite foreign to their natural condition into creaturesof mere convention placed one on each sideof a younger brother fresh from the plains andwhom it was their duty to teach new services forthe trunk new affections and haply the manner inwhich to carry with dignity the howdah of arajahwith many allusions to their policy but with nodirect intimation of their own intention the seniorsof the council continued the conversation until thehour for the meeting in the doge s palace drewnigh they then separated as privately as theyhad come together in order that no vulgar eyemight penetrate the mystery of their official

character of the judges and in that of theaccused by a peculiar arrangement of the lamptoo most of the light was thrown upon the spot itwas intended the prisoner should occupy while theside of the apartment on which the inquisitors satewas left in a dimness that well accorded with theirgloomy and secret duties previously to the openingof the door by which the person to be examinedwas to appear

his fateas jacopo had often been before the councilthough not as a prisoner he betrayed neither surprisenor alarm at the black aspect of all his eyebeheld his features were composed though palehis

they deemed necessary to theoccasionwilt thou consult thine own safety jacopo andreveal all thou knowest of this affair of the neapolitan continued the inquisitor when this byplaywas endedjacopo betrayed no weakness at the menace impliedby the words of the senator but after a moments reflection he answered with as much franknessas he could have used at the confessionalit is known to you illustrious senator he saidthat the state had a desire to match the heiress oftiepolo to its own advantage that she was belovedof the neapolitan noble and that as is wontbetween young and virtuous hearts she returnedhis love as became a maiden of her high conditionand tender years is there any thing extraordinaryin the circumstance that two of so illustrious hopesshould struggle to prevent

at length the elder of the threeresumed the examinationwilt thou impart the manner of this escapejacopo he demanded remember thou haststill a life to redeem signore it is scarce worth the trouble but todoyou pleasure nothing shall be concealedjacopo then recounted in simple and undisguisedterms the entire means employed by don camilloin effecting his escape his hopes his disappointmentsand his final success in this narrative nothingwas concealed but the place in which theladies had temporarily taken refuge and the nameof gelsomina even the attempt of giacomo grason the life of the neapolitan and the agencyof the hebrew were fully exposed none listenedto this explanation so intently as the young husbandnotwithstanding his public duties his pulses quickenedas the prisoner dwelt on the different chancesof the lovers and when their final union was proclaimedhe felt his heart bound with delight onthe other hand his more practised colleagues heardthe detail of the bravo with politic coolness theeffect of all factitious systems is to render the feelingssubservient to expediency convention andfiction take place of passion and truth and like themussulman with his doctrine of predestination thereis no one more acquiescent in defeat than he whothe bravo has obtained an advantage in the face of nature andjustice his resignation being in common as perfectas his previous arrogance was insupportablethe two old senators perceived at once that doncamillo and his fair companion were completelybeyond the reach of their power and they instantlyadmitted the wisdom of making a merit of necessityhaving no farther occasion for jacopo they summonedthe keepers and dismissed him to his cellit will be seemly to send letters of congratulationto the cardinal secretary on the union of hisnephew with so rich an heiress of our city saidthe inquisitor of the ten as the door closed on theretiring group so great an interest as that of theneapolitan should be propitiatedbut should he urge the state s resistance to hishopes returned the signor soranzo in feeble objectionto so bold a schemewe will excuse it as the act of a former councilthese misconceptions are the unavoidable consequencesof the caprices of liberty signore thesteed that ranges the plains in the freedom of naturecannot be held to perfect command like the dullbeast that draws the car this is the first of yoursittings in the three but experience will show youthat excellent as we are in system we are not quiteperfect in practice this is grave matter of theyoung gradenigo signorii have long known his unworthiness returnedhis more aged colleague it is a thousand pitiesthat so honorable and so noble a patrician shouldhave produced so ignoble a child but neither thestate nor the city can tolerate assassinationwould it were less frequent exclaimed thesignore soranzo in perfect sinceritywould it were indeed there are hints in oursecret information which tend to confirm the charger the bravoof jacopo though long experience has taught usto put full faith in his reportshow is jacopo then an agent of the policeof that more at our leisure signor soranzo atpresent we must look to this attempt on the life ofone protected by our lawsthe three then entered into a serious discussionof the case of the two delinquents venice like alldespotic governments had the merit of great efficiencyin its criminal police when it was disposedto exert it justice was sure enough in those instancesin which the interests of the governmentitself were not involved or in which bribery couldnot well be used as to the latter through thejealousy of the state and the constant agency ofthose who were removed from temptation by beingalready in possession of a monopoly of benefits itwas by no means as frequent as in some other communitiesin which the affluent were less interestedthe signor soranzo had now a fair occasion for theexercise of his generous feelings though relatedto the house of gradenigo he was not backward indecrying the conduct of its heir his first impulseswere to make a terrible example of the accused andto show the world that no station brought with it invenice impunity for crime from this view of thecase however he was gradually enticed by his companionswho reminded him that the law commonlymade a distinction between the intention and theexecution of an offence driven from his first determinationby the cooler heads of his colleaguesthe young inquisitor next proposed that the caseshould be sent to the ordinary tribunals for judgmentinstances had not been wanting in which the aristocracyof venice sacrificed one of its body to theseemliness of justice for when such cases weremanaged with discretion they rather strengthenedthan weakened their ascendency but the presentthe bravo crime was known to be too common to permit solavish an expenditure of their immunities and theold inquisitors opposed the wish of their youngercolleague with great plausibility and with someshow of reason it was finally resolved that theyshould themselves decide on the casethe next question was the degree of punishmentthe wily senior of the council began by proposinga banishment for a few months for giacomo gradenighwas already obnoxious to the anger of thestate on more accounts than one but this punishmentwas resisted by the signor soranzo with theardor of an uncorrupted and generous mind thelatter gradually prevailed his companions takingcare that their compliance should have the air of aconcession to his arguments the result of all thismanagement was that the heir of gradenigo wascondemned to ten years retirement in the provincesand hosea to banishment for life should the readerbe of opinion that strict justice was not meted out tothe offenders he should remember that the hebrewoughtto be glad to have escaped as he didwe must not conceal this judgment nor itsmotive observed the inquisitor of the ten whenthe affair was concluded the state is never aloser for letting its justice be knownnor for its exercise i should hope returnedthe signor soranzo as our affairs are ended forthe night is it your pleasures signori that we returnto our palaces nay we have this matter of jacopohim may we now surely turn over to the ordinarytribunals as you may decide signori is this your pleasureboth the others bowed assent and the usual preparationswere made for departureere the two seniors of the council left the palace the bravohowever they held a long and secret conferencetogether the result was a private order to thecriminal judge and then they returned each to hisown abode like men who had the approbationoftheir own conscienceson the other hand the signor soranzo hastenedto his own luxurious and happy dwelling for thefirst time in his life he entered it with a distrust ofhimself without being conscious of the reasonhe felt sad for he had taken the first step in thattortuous and corrupting path which eventuallyleads to the destruction of all those generous andnoble sentiments which can only flourish apartfrom the sophistry and fictions of selfishness hewould have rejoiced to have been as light of heartas at the moment he handed his fairhaired partnerinto the gondola that night but his head had pressedthe pillow for many hours before sleep drew aveil over the solemn trifling with the most seriousof our duties in which he had been an actorchapter xiiiart thou not guilty no indeed i am notrogersthe following morning brought the funeral ofantonio the agents of the police took the precautionto circulate in the city that the senate permittedthis honor to the memory of the old fishermanon account of his success in the regatta andas some atonement for his unmerited and mysteriousdeath all the men of the lagunes were assembledin the square at the appointed hour in decentguise flattered with the notice that their craftthe bravo received and more than half disposed to forgettheir former anger in the present favor thus easyis it for those who are elevated above their fellowcreaturesby the accident of birth or by the opinionsof a factitious social organization to repair thewrongs they do in deeds by small concessions oftheir conventional superioritymasses were still chanted for the soul of oldantonio before the altar of st mark foremostamong the priests was the good carmelite whohad scarce known hunger or fatigue in his piousdesire to do the offices of the church in behalf ofone whose fate he might be said to have witnessedhis zeal however in that moment of excitementpassed unnoticed by all but those whose business itwas to suffer no unusual display of character norany unwonted circumstance to have place withoutattracting their suspicion as the carmelite finallywithdrew from the altar previously to the removalof the body he felt the sleeve of his robe slightlydrawn aside and yielding to the impulse he quicklyfound himself among the columns of that gloomychurch alone with a strangerfather thou hast shrived many a parting soul i observed rather than asked the otherit is the duty of my holy office sonthe state will note thy services there will beneed of thee when the body of this fisherman iscommitted to the earththe monk shuddered but making the sign of thecross he bowed his pale face in signification of hisreadiness to discharge the duty at that momentthe bearers lifted the body and the procession issuedupon the great square first marched theusual lay underlings of the cathedral who werefollowed by those who chanted the offices of theoccasion among the latter the carmelite hastenedto take his station next came the corpse without the bravoa coffin for that is a luxury of the grave even nowunknown to the italians of old antonio s degreethe body was clad in the holiday vestments of afisherman the hands and feet being naked a crosslay on the breast the gray hairs were blowingabout in the air and in frightful adornment of theghastliness of death a bouquet of flowers wasplaced upon the mouth the bier was rich in gildingand carving another melancholy evidence ofthe lingering wishes and false direction of humanvanitynext to this characteristic equipage of the deadwalked a lad whose brown cheek halfnaked bodyand dark roving eye announced the grandson ofthe fisherman venice knew when to yield gracefullyand the boy was liberated unconditionallyfrom the galleys in pity as it was whispered forthe untimely fate of his parent there was the aspiringlook the dauntless spirit and the rigid honestyof antonio in the bearing of the lad but thesequalities were now smothered by a natural griefand as in the case of him whose funeral escort hefollowed something obscured by the rude chancesof his lot from time to time the bosom of thegenerous boy heaved as they marched along thequay taking the route of the arsenal and therewere moments that his lips quivered grief threateningto overcome his manhoodstill not a tear wetted his cheek until the bodydisappeared from his view then nature triumphedand straying from out the circle he took a seat apartand wept as one of his years and simplicity wouldbe apt to weep at finding himself a solitary wandererin the wilderness of the worldthus terminated the incident of antonio vecchiothe fisherman whose name soon ceased to be mentionedin that city of mysteries except on the laguneswhere the men of his craft long vaunted histhe bravo merit with the net and the manner in which he boreaway the prize from the best oars of venice hisdescendant lived and toiled like others of his conditionand we will here dismiss him by saying thathe so far inherited the native qualities of his ancestorthat he forbore to appear a few hours later inthe crowd which curiosity and vengeance drewinto the piazzettafather anselmo took boat to return to the canalsand when he landed at the quay of the smallersquare it was with the hope that he would now bepermitted to seek those of whose fate he was stillignorant but in whom he felt so deep an interestnot so however the individual who had addressedhim in the cathedral was apparently in waitingand knowing the uselessness as well as the dangerof remonstrance where the state was concernedthe carmelite permitted himself to be conductedwhither his guide pleased they took a deviousroute but it led them to the public prisons herethe priest was shown into the keeper s apartmentwhere he was desired to wait a summons from hiscompanionour business now leads us to the cell of jacopoon quitting the presence of the three he had beenremanded to his gloomy room where he passed thenight like others similarly situated with the appearanceof the dawn the bravo had been led beforethose who ostensibly discharged the duties ofhis judges we say ostensibly for justice neverwas yet pure under a system in which the governorshave an interest in the least separated from thatof the governed for in all cases which involve theascendency of the existing authorities the instinctof selfpreservation is as certain to bias their decisionas that of life is to cause man to shun dangerif such is the fact in countries of milder sway thereader will easily believe in its existence in a state the bravolike that of venice as may have been anticipatedthose who sat in judgment on jacopo had their instructionsarid the trial that he sustained was rathera concession to appearances than an homage tothe laws all the records were duly made witnesseswere examined or said to be examined andcare was

impunity even in the centre of the canalsduring the morning the credulous tradesmen weremuch engaged in recounting to each other the differentflagrant deeds that in the course of the lastthree or four years had been imputed to his handone spoke of the body of a stranger that had beenfound near the gaminghouses frequented by thosewho visited venice another recalled the fate ofthe young noble who had fallen by the assassin sblow even on the rialto and another went into thedetails of a murder which had deprived a motherof her only son and the daughter of a patrician ofher love in this manner as one after another contributedto the list a little group assembled on thequay enumerated no less than fiveandtwenty liveswhich were believed to have been taken by thehand of jacopo without including the vindictiveand useless assassination of him whose funeral riteshad just been celebrated happily perhaps for hispeace of mind the subject of all these rumors andof the maledictions which they drew upon his headknew nothing of either before his judges he hadmade no defence whatever firmly refusing to answertheir interrogatoriesye know what i have done messires he saidhaughtily and what i have not done ye knowas for yourselves look to your own interestswhen again in his cell he demanded food andthe bravo ate tranquilly though with moderation every instrumentwhich could possibly be used against hislife was then removed his irons were finally andcarefully examined and he was left to his thoughtsit was in this situation that the prisoner heard theapproach of footsteps to his cell the bolts turnedand the door opened the form of a priest appearedbetween him and the day the latter howeverheld a lamp which as the cell was again shut andsecured he placed on the low shelf that held thejug and

fiercethan any which it had yet been his fate to endurethe lingering desires of the world conquered andhe broke silencefather he said advancing to the length of hischain and speaking both solemnly and with dignityi had hoped i had prayed that this unhappy butinnocent creature might have turned from her own the bravoweakness with nothing when she came to knowthat the man she loved was a bravo but i didinjustice to the heart of woman tell me gelsomina and as thou values thy salvation deceive menot canst thou look at me without horrorgelsomina trembled but she raised her eyes andsmiled on him as

draw the veil before the scene that followednear an hour must pass before we can again removeit the cell then exhibited a group in its centreover which the lamp shed its feeble light markingthe countenances of the different personages withstrong tints and deep shadows in a manner to bringforth all the force of italian expression the carmelitewas seated on the stool while jacopo andgelsomina knelt beside him the former of the twolast was speaking earnestly while his auditorscaught each syllable that issued from his lips asif interest in his innocence were still stronger thancuriosityi have told you father he continued that afalse accusation of having wronged the customsbrought my unhappy parent under the senate s displeasureand that he was many years an innocentinhabitant of one of these accursed cells while webelieved him in exile among the islands at lengthwe succeeded in getting such proof before the councilas ought to have satisfied the patricians of theirown injustice i am afraid that when men pretendthat the chosen of the earth exercise authority theyare not ready to admit their errors for it would beproof against the merit of their system the councildelayed a weary time to do us justice so longthat my poor mother sank under her sufferings mysister a girl of gelsomina s years followed hersoon for the only reason given by the state whens the bravopressed for proof

without publishingtheir fallibility the credit of certain great patricianswas concerned and i fear there is a moralityin these councils which separates the deed of theman from those of the senators
