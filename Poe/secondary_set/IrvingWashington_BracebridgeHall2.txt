in his perambulations about his estatein which he is often attended by a kind of cabinetcouncil his prime minister the steward is avery worthy and honest old man and one of thoseveteran retainers that assume a right of way that is to say a right to have his own way fromhaving lived time out of mind on the place heloves the estate even better than he does thevol ii english country gentlemensquire and thwarts the latter sadly in many ofhis projects of improvement and alteration indeedthe old man is a little apt to oppose everyplan that does not originate with himself andwill hold long arguments about it over a stileor on a rise of ground until the squire who hasahigh opinion of his ability and integrity is fainto give up the point such concession immediatelymollifies the old steward and it often happensthat after walking a field or two in silencewith his hands behind his back chewing the cudof reflection he will suddenly observe that hehas been turning the matter over in his mindand upon the whole he thinks he will take hishonour's advicechristy the huntsman is another of the squire'sfrequent attendants to whom he continually refersin matters of local history as to a chronicleof the estate having been in a manner acquaintedwith many of the trees from the verytime that they were acorns old nimrod as ihave already shown is rather pragmatical on allthese points of knowledge upon which he valuesenglish country gentlemen himself but the squire never contradicts him and is certainly one of the most indulgent potentatesthat was ever henpecked by his ministershe often laughs about it himself and evidentlyyields to these old men in compliancewith the bent of his own humour he likes thishonest independence of old age for with all hisaristocratical feelings there is nothing that disgustshim sooner than any appearance of fawningor servilityi really have seen no display of royal statethat could compare with one of the squire'sprogresses about his paternal fields and throughhis hereditary woodlands with several of thesefaithful adherents about him and followed by abody guard of dogs he encourages a franknessand manliness of deportment among hisdependants and is the personal friend of histenants inquiring into their concerns and assistingthem in times of difficulty and hardshipthis has rendered him one of the most popularand of course one of the happiest of landlords english country gentlemenindeed i do not know a more enviable conditionof life than that of an english gentlemanof sound judgment and good feelings who passesthe greater part of his time on an

intelligenceand novelties of the capital while he isremoved from its hurry and distractions hehas ample means of occupation and amusementwithin his own domains he may diversify histime by rural occupations by rural sports bystudy and by the delights of friendly societycollected within his own hospitable hallsor if his views and feelings are of a more extensiveand liberal nature he has it greatly in hispower to do good and to have that good immediatelyreflected back upon himself he canrender essential service to his country by assistingin the disinterested administration of thelaws by watching over the opinions and principlesof the lower orders around him by diffcountry gentlemen fusing among them those lights which may beimportant to their welfare by mingling franklyamong them

withoutany sacrifice of personal dignity without anydegrading arts of popularity without any trucklingto vulgar prejudices or concurrence in vulgarclamour but by the steady influence of sincereand

long established names andthat love of order and quiet which characterizesthe nation gives a vast influence to the descendantsof the old families whose forefathers havebeen lords of the soil from time

too that so many become exiles fromtheir native land crowding the hotels of foreignnations and expending upon thankless strangersthe wealth so hardly drained from their laboriouspeasantry having as it

hadnot however his usual briskness and vivacitybut loitered about the room with somewhat ofabsence of manner humming the old song golovely rose tell her that wastes her time andme and then leaning against the window andlooking upon the landscape he uttered a very a bachelor's confessionsbible sigh as i had not been accustomed tosee master simon in a pensive mood i thoughtthere might be some

has been said or sung it must be on sucha morningthe weather certainly had its effect even uponmaster simon for he seemed obstinately bentupon the pensive mood instead of skippingbriskly along smacking his dog whip whistlingquaint ditties or telling sporting anecdotes heleaned on my arm and talked about the bachelor's confessions preaching nuptials from whence he made severaldigressions upon the character of women touched a little upon the tender passion andmade sundry very excellent though rather triteobservations upon disappointments in love itwas evident that he had something on his mindwhich he wished to impart but felt awkward inapproaching it i was curious to see to whatthis strain would lead but i was determined notto assist him indeed i mischievously pretendedto turn the conversation and talked of hisusual topics dogs horses and hunting but hew as very brief in his replies and invariably gotback by hook or by crook into the sentimentalvein at length we came to a clump of treesthat overhung a whispering brook with a rusticbench at their feet the trees were grievouslyscored with letters and devices which had grownout of all shape and size by the growth of thebark and

amorous follies andabove all should never dream of choosing myfriend master simon for a confidant he didnot wait however for a reply the inquiry wasmerely a prelude to a confession on his ownpart and after several circumlocutions and whimsicalpreambles he fairly disburdened himselfof a very tolerable story of his having been crossedin lovethe reader will very probably suppose that itrelated to the gay widow who jilted him notlong since at doncaster races no such thingit was about a sentimental passion that heonce had for a most beautiful young lady whowrote poetry and played on the harp he usedto serenade her and indeed he described severaltender and gallant scenes in which he evidentlywas picturing himself in his mind's eye as someelegant hero of romance though unfortunatelya

and then a sigh and endeavouring tolook sentimental and melancholyall that i recollect is that the lady accordingto his account was certainly a little touchedfor she used to accept all the music that hecopied for her harp and the patterns that hedrew for her dresses and he began to flatterhimself after a long course of delicate attentionsthat he was gradually fanning a gentle flame inher heart when she suddenly accepted the handof a rich boisterous foxhunting baronet withouteither music or sentiment who carried herbystorm after a fortnight's courtship mastersimon could not help concluding by some obsera bachelor's confessionsnation about modest merit and the powerof gold over the sex as a remembrance ofhis passion he pointed out a heart carved onthe bark of one of the trees but which

direction of the sound thestrokes grew louder and louder as we advanced there was evidently a vigorous arm wielding theaxe the squire quickened his pace but invain a loud crack and a succeeding crash toldthat the mischief had been done and some childof the forest laid low when we came to theplace we found master simon and several othersstanding about a tall and beautifully straightyoung larch which had just been felledmayday customs the squire though a man of most harmoniousdisposition was completely put out oftune by this circumstance he felt like a monarchwitnessing the murder of one of his liegesubjects and demanded with some asperity themeaning of the outrage it turned out to be anaffair of master simon's who had selected thetree from its height and straightness for a maypole the old one which stood on the villagegreen being unfit for farther serviceif any thing could have soothed the ire of myworthy host it would have been the reflectionthat his tree had fallen in a good cause and isaw that there was a great struggle between hisfondness for his groves and his devotion to maydayhe could not contemplate the prostrate treehowever without indulging in lamentation andmaking a kind of funeral eulogy and he forbadthat any tree should thenceforward be cut downort his estate without a warrant from himselfbeing determined he said to hold the sovereignpower of life and death in his own hands mayday customsthis mention of the maypole struck my attentionand i inquired whether the old customsconnected with it were still kept up with anyspirit in this part of the countrythe squire shook his head mournfully and ifound i had touched on one of his tender pointsfor he grew quite melancholy in bewailing thetotal decline of old mayday though it is regularlycelebrated in the neighbouring villageyet it has been merely resuscitated by his countenanceand is kept up in a forced state of existenceat his expense he meets with continualdiscouragements and finds great difficulty ingetting the country bumpkins to play their partstolerablyhe manages to have every year a queen ofthe may but as to robin hood friar tuckthe dragon the hobby horse and all

himbrought up as i have been in a new countryi may appreciate too highly the faint vestiges ofancient customs which now and then meetwith and the interest i express in them mayprovoke a smile from those who are negligentlysuffering them to pass away but with whateverindifference they may be regarded by thoseto the manner born yet in my mind thelingering flavour of them imparts a charm torustic life which nothing else could readily suprshall never forget the delight i felt on firstseeing a maypole it was on the banks of thedee close by the picturesque old bridge thatstretches across that

ofthe rude usages and coarse amusements of formerdays i cannot but regret that this innocentand fanciful festival has fallen into disuse itseemed appropriate to this verdant and pastoralcountry and calculated to light up the too pervadinggravity of the nation i value everycustom that tends to infuse poetical feeling intothe common people and to sweeten and softenthe rudeness of rustic manners

bythe apothecary's philosophy which is exactlyone observation deep consisting of indisputablemaxims such as may be gathered from the mottoesof tobacco boxes i had a specimen of hisphilosophy in my

by the strange and melancholy storiesthat are often connected with family paintingsit needs but little stretch of fancy on amoonlight night or by the flickering light of acandle to set the old

stories afloat and connectingthem with the lonely and peculiar places ofthe neighbourhood whenever he read anylegend of a striking nature he endeavoured totransplant it and give it a local habitationamong the scenes of his boyhood many ofthese stories took root and he says he is oftenamused with the odd shapes in which they willcome back to him in some old woman's narrativeafter they have been circulating for yearsamong the peasantry and undergoing rustic additionsand amendments among these maydoubtless be numbered that of the crusader's popular superstitionsghost which i have mentioned in the account ofmy christmas visit and another about thehardriding squire of yore the family nimrodwho is sometimes heard on stormy winternights galloping with hound and horn over awild

subject with mastersimon the other evening in the dark avenue hehinted that he had himself once or twice heardstrange sounds at night very like a pack ofhounds in cry and that once as he was returningrather late from a hunting dinner he hadseen a strange figure galloping along this samemoor but as he was riding rather fast at thetime and in a hurry to get home he did notstop to ascertain what it waspopular superstitions are fast fading away inengland owing to the general diffusion of knowledgeand the bustling intercourse kept upthroughout the country still they have theirpopular superstitions strong holds and lingering places and a retiredneighbourhood like this is apt to be one of themthe parson tells me that he meets with many traditionalbeliefs and notions among the commonpeople which he has been able to draw from themin the course of familiar conversation though theyare rather shy of avowing them to strangers andparticularly to the gentry who are apt tolaugh at them he says there are several of hisold parishioners who remember when the villagehad its barguest or bar ghost a spirit supposedto belong to a town or village and to predict anyimpending misfortune

a differentappellation from any of those by which i have popular superstitionsheretofore heard him called the parson assuresme that many of the peasantry believe inhousehold goblins called dobbies which liveabout particular farms and houses in the sameway that robin good fellow did of old sometimesthey haunt the barns and outhouses andnow and then will assist the farmer wonderfullyby getting in all his hay or corn in a single nightin general however they prefer to live withindoors and are fond of keeping about the greathearths and basking at night after the familyhave gone to bed by the glowing embers whenput into particular good humour by the warmthof their lodgings and the tidiness of the housemaidsthey will overcome their natural lazinessarid do a vast deal of household work

areothers of a more gloomy and unsocial nature that keep about lonely barns at a distance fromany dwelling house or about ruins and oldbridges these are full of mischievous andoften malignant tricks and are fond of playingpranks upon benighted travellers thereis a story among the old people of one thathaunted a ruined mill just by a bridge thatcrosses a small stream how that late one nightas a traveller was passing on horseback thedobbin jumped up behind him and grasped himso close round the body that he had no powerto help himself but expected to be squeezed todeath luckily his heels were loose with whichhe plied the sides of his steed and was carriedwith the wonderful instinct of a traveller'shorse straight to the village inn had the inn popular superstitionsbeen at any greater distance there is no doubtbut he would have been strangled to death asit was the good people were a long time inbringing him to his senses and it was remarkedthat the first sign he showed of returning consciousnesswas to call for a bottom of brandythe only instance of one of the householddobbies that the parson has met with is onethat was said to keep about the old farm houseof ready money jack it has long been traditionali am told that one of these good naturedgoblins is attached to the tibbets family andcame with them when they moved into this partof the country for it is remarked that they keepwith certain families and follow them whereverthey remove there is a large old fashionedfireplace in the farm house which affords finequarters for a chimney corner sprite of the kindthat likes to lie warm especially as readymoney jack keeps up rousing fires in the wintertimethe old people of the village recollectmany stories that were told about this goblin inpopular superstitions their young days it was thought to havebrought good luck to the house and to be thereason why the tibbets were always beforehandin the world why their farm was alwaysin better order their hay got in sooner and their corn better stacked than that of theirneighbours the present mrs tibbets at thetime of her courtship had a number of thesestones told her by the country gossips and whenmarried was a little fearful about living in ahouse where such a hobgoblin was said to hauntjack however who has always treated this storywith great contempt assured her that there wasno spirit kept about his house that he could notat any time lay in the red sea with one flourishof his cudgel still his wife has never got completelyover her notions on the subject shehas had a horseshoe nailed on the thresholdand keeps a branch of country or mountain ashwith its red berries suspended from one of thegreat beams in the parlour sure protections fromall evil spiritsvol ii popular superstitionsthese stories however as i before observedare fast fading away and in another generationor two will probably be completely forgottenthere is something however about these ruralsuperstitions that is extremely pleasing to theimagination i allude to those concerning thegood humoured race of household demons andindeed to the whole fairy mythology theenglish have given an inexpressible charm tothese superstitions by the manner in which theyhave associated them with whatever is mosthomefelt and delightful in rustic life or refreshingand beautiful in nature i do not know amore fascinating race of beings than these littlefabled people that haunted the southern sides ofhills and mountains lurked in flowers and aboutfountain heads glided through keyhole into ancienthalls watched over farm houses and dairies danced on the green by summer moonlight and onthe kitchen hearth in winter they seem to me toaccord with the nature of english housekeepingand english scenery i always have them in mindwhen i see a fine old english mansion with itspopular superstitions wide hall and spacious kitchen or a venerablefarm house in which there is so much firesidecomfort and good housewifery there was somethingof national character in their love of orderand cleanliness in the vigilance with whichthey watched over the economy of the kitchenand the functions of the servants munificentlyrewarding with silver sixpence in shoe the tidyhousemaid but venting their direful wrath inmidnight bobs and pinches upon the sluttishdairy maid i think i can trace the good effectsof this ancient fairy sway over household concernsin the care that prevails to the present dayamong english housemaids to put their kitchensin order before they go to bedi have said too that these fairy superstitionsseemed to me to accord with the nature of englishscenery they suit these small landscapeswhich are divided by honeysuckled hedges intosheltered fields and meadows where the grassis mingled with daisies butter cups and harebellswhen i first found myself among englishscenery i was continually reminded of thepopular superstitionssweet pastoral images which distinguish theirfairy mythology and when for the first time acircle in the grass was pointed out to me as oneof the rings where they were formerly supposedto have held their moonlight revels it seemedfor a moment as if fairy land were no longera fablebrowne in his britannia's pastorals gives apicture of the kind of scenery to which i alludea pleasant meadwhere fairies often did their measures treadwhich in the meadows make such circles greenas if with garlands

nature whichdistinguishes them have closely adhered to thepopular superstitions ssimple and familiar imagery which they foundin these popular superstitions and have thusgiven to their fairy mythology those continualallusions to the farm house and the dairy thegreen meadow and the fountain head that fillour minds with the delightful associations ofrural life it is curious to observe how themost beautiful fictions have their origin amongthe rude and ignorant there is an indescribablecharm about the illusions with which chimericalignorance once clothed every subjectthese twilight views of nature are often morecaptivating than any which are revealed by therays of enlightened philosophy the most accomplishedand poetical minds therefore havebeen fain to search back into these accidentalconceptions of what are termed barbarous agesand to draw from thence their finest imageryand machinery if we look through our mostadmired poets we shall find that their mindshave been impregnated by these popular fancies and that those have succeeded best whohave adhered closest to the simplicity of their popular superstitionsrustic originals such is the case with shakspearein his midsummer's night's dreamwhich so minutely describes the employmentsand amusements of fairies and embodies allthe notions concerning them which were currentamong the vulgarit is thus that poetry in england hasechoed back every rustic note softened intoperfect melody it is thus that it has spread itscharms over every day life displacing nothing taking things as it found them but tinting themup with its own magical hues until every greenhill and fountain head every fresh meadownay every humble flower is full of song andstoryi am dwelling too long perhaps upon a threadbaresubject yet it brings up with it a thousanddelicious recollections of those happy days ofchildhood when the imperfect knowledge i havesince obtained had not yet dawned upon mymind and when a fairy tale was true history tomei have often been so transported by thepleasure of these recollections as almost to wishpopular superstitions that i had been born in the days when the fictionsof poetry were believed even now i cannotlook upon these fanciful creations of ignoranceand credulity without a lurking regret thatthey have all passed away the experience ofmy early days tells me that they were sources ofexquisite delight and i sometimes questionwhether the naturalist who can dissect the flowersof the field receives half the pleasure from contemplatingthem that he did who consideredthem the abodes of elves and fairies i feel convincedthat the true interests and solid happinessof man are promoted by the advancement oftruth yet i cannot but mourn over the pleasanterrors which it has trampled down

to show me as a specimenof a real country inn the head quarters of villagegossip i had remarked it before in myperambulations about the place it has a deepold fashioned porch leading into a large hallwhich serves for a tap room and traveller's roomhaving a wide fireplace with highbacked settleson each side where the wise men of thevillage gossip over their ale and hold their sessionsduring the long winter evenings thea village politician landlord is an easy indolent fellow shaped a littlelike one of his own beer barrels who is aptto stand gossiping at his door with his wig onone side and his hands in his pockets whilst hiswife and daughter attend to customers hiswife however is fully competent to manage theestablishment and indeed from long habituderules over all the frequenters of the tap room ascompletely as if they were her dependents insteadof her patrons not a veteran ale bibberbut pays homage to her having no doubt beenoften in her arrears i have already hinted thatshe is

meagre but activein his make with a long pale bilious face ablack beard so ill shaven as to bloody his shirtcollara feverish eye and a hat sharpened up atthe sides into a most pragmatical shape hehad a newspaper in his hand and seemed to becommenting on its contents to the thorough convictionof mine host at the sight of mastersimon the landlord was a little flurried andbegan to rub his hands edge away from his cornerand make several profound publican bows while the orator took no other notice of my companionthan to talk rather louder than beforeand with as i thought something of an air

cursed busy fellow that had a confoundedtrick of talking and was apt to bother oneabout the national debt and such nonsense from which i suspected that master simon hadbeen rendered wary of him by some accidentalencounter on the field of argument for theseradicals are continually roving about in quest ofwordy warfare and never so happy as whenthey can tilt a gentleman logician out of

has already made two or threecomplete converts or new lights has shaken the a village politicianfaith of several others and has grievously puzzledthe brains of many of the oldest villagerswho had never thought about politics or scarceany thing else during their whole liveshe is lean and meagre from the constant restlessnessof mind and body worrying about withnewspapers and pamphlets in his

becut up into small farms and kitchen gardens orfeed good mutton instead of worthless deerhe is a great thorn in the side of the squirewho is sadly afraid he will introduce politics intothe village and turn it into an unhappy thinkingcommunity he is a still greater grievanceto master simon who has hitherto been able tosway the political opinions of the place withoutmuch cost of learning or of logic but has beenvery much puzzled of late to weed out the doubtsand heresies already sown by this champion ofreform indeed the latter has taken completea village politician command at the tap room

notspare her own soft headed husband for listeningto what she terms such low lived politicswhat makes the good woman the more violentis the perfect coolness with which the radicallistens to her attacks drawing his face up intoa provoking supercilious smile and when shehas talked herself out of breath quietly askingher for a taste of her homebrewedthe only person that is in any way a matchvol ii a village politicianfor this redoubtable politician is ready moneyjack tibbets who maintains his stand in thetap room in defiance of the radical and all hisworks jack is one of the most loyal men in thecountry without being able to reason about thematter he has that admirable quality for atough arguer also that he never knows whenhe is beat he has half a dozen old maximswhich he advances on all occasions and thoughhis antagonist may overturn them never so oftenyet he always brings them anew to the fieldhe is like the robber in ariosto who thoughhis head might be cut off half a hundred timesyet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinklingand returned as sound a man as ever to thechargewhatever does not square with jack's simpleand obvious creed he sets down for frenchpolitics for notwithstanding the peace hecannot be persuaded the french are not stilllaying plots to ruin the nation and get hold of thebank of england the radical attempted tooverwhelm him one day by a long passage froma village politician a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believesin newspapers in reply he gave himone of the stanzas which he has by heart fromhis favourite and indeed only author old tusserand which he calls his golden rules leave princes affairs descanted onand tend to such doings as stand thee uponfear god and offend not the king nor his lawsand keep thyself out of the

pass through the neighbouringvillage i believe have mentioned thatthe hall is situated in a retired part of the countryat a distance from any great coach road inso much that the arrival of a traveller is apt tomake every one look out of the window and tocause some talk among the ale drinkers at thelittle inn i was at a loss therefore to accountfor the squire's indignation at a measure apparentlyfraught with convenience and advantageuntil i found that the conveniences of travellingwere among his greatest grievancesin fact he rails against stage coaches postchaises and turnpike roads as serious causes ofthe corruption of english rural manners theyhave given facilities he says to every humdrumcitizen to trundle his family about the kingdomand have sent the follies and fashions of townwhirling in coach loads to the remotest parts ofthe island the whole country he says is traversedby these flying cargoes every byroad isexplored by enterprizing tourists from cheapsideand the poultry and every gentleman's parktravelling illand lawns invaded by cockney sketchers of bothsexes with portable chairs and portfolios fordrawinghe laments over this as destroying the charmof privacy and interrupting the quiet of countrylife but more especially as affecting thesimplicity of the peasantry and filling theirheads with half city notions a great coachinn he says is enough to ruin the manners ofa whole village it creates a horde of sots andidlers makes gapers and gazers and newsmongers of the common people and knowingjokes of the country bumpkins the squirehas something of the old feudal feeling helooks back with regret to the good old timeswhen journeys were only made on horsebackand the extraordinary difficulties of travellingowing to bad roads bad accommodations andhighway

slepton the night previous to their departure and atthe bottom of the yard was a magnificent signrepresenting them in the act of sallying forthi was pleased too at noticing that though thepresent inn

country when the birds aresinging about the window and the sunbeamspeeping through the curtains i was roused bythe sound of music on going down stairs ifound a number of villagers drest in their holydayclothes bearing a pole ornamented with garlandsand ribbands and accompanied by the vilvolii maydaylage band of music under the direction of thetailor the pale fellow who plays on the clarionthey had all sprigs of hawthorn or as it is called the may in their hats and had broughtgreen branches and flowers to decorate the halldoor and windows they had come to give noticethat the maypole was reared on the greenand to invite the household to witness the sportsthe hall according to custom became a sceneof hurry and delighted confusion the servantswere all agog with may and music and therewas no keeping the tongues or the feet of themaids quiet who were anticipating the sports ofthe green and the evening dancei repaired to the village at an early hour toenjoy the merrymaking the morning waspure and sunny such as a maymorning is alwaysdescribed the fields were white with daisies the hawthorn was covered with its fragrant blossomsthe bee hummed about every bank andthe swallow played high in the air about the villagesteeple it was one of those days whenwe seem to draw in pleasure with the very airmayday we breathe and to feel happy we know not whywhoever has felt the worth of worthy man orhas doated on lovely woman will on such a daycall them tenderly to mind and feel his heart allalive with long buried recollectionsbefore reaching the village i saw the maypoletowering above the cottages with its gaygarlands and streamers and heard the sound ofmusic i found that there had been booths setupnear it for the reception of company and abower of green branches and flowers for thequeen of may a fresh rosycheeked girl of thevillagea band of morris dancers were capering onthe green in their fantastic dresses jingling withhawks bells with a boy dressed up as maidmarian and the attendant fool rattling his boxto collect contributions from the bystandersi noticed also the gipsy women alreadyplying their mystery in scorners of the villagereading the hands of the simple countrygirls and no doubt promising them all goodhusbands and tribes of children maydaythe squire made his appearance in thecourse of the morning attended by the parsonand was received with loud acclamations hemingled among the country people throughoutthe day giving and receiving pleasure whereverhe wentthe amusements of the day were under themanagement of slingsbyby the schoolmaster who is not merely lord of misrule in hisschool but likewise master of the revels to thevillage he was bustling about with the perplexedand anxious air of a man who has theoppressive burthen of promoting other people'smerriment upon his mind he had involvedhimself in a dozen scrapes in consequence ofa politic intrigue which by the bye mastersimon and the oxonian were at the bottom ofwhich had for object the election of the queenof may he had met with violent oppositionfrom a faction of ale drinkers who were in favourof a bouncing bar maid the daughter of the tavernkeeper but he had been too strongly backednot to carry his point though it shows thatmayday these crowns like all others are objects ofgreat ambition and heart burning j am toldthat master simon takes great interest thoughin an underhand way in the election of thesemay day queens and that the chaplet is generallysecured for some rustic beauty that hasfound favour in his eyesin the course of the day there were variousgames of strength and agility on the green atwhich a knot of village veterans presided asjudges of the lists among these i perceivedthat ready money jack took the lead lookingwith a learned and critical eye on the merits ofthe different candidates his hat was drawn alittle on one side over his brow which gaveadditional effect to his decisions and though hewas very laconic and sometimes merely expressedhimself by a nod yet it was evident that hisopinions far outweighed those of the mostloquaciousyoung jack tibbets was the hero of the dayand carried off most of the prizes though insome of the feats of agility he was rivalled by the maydayprodigal son who appeared much in hiselement on this occasion but his most formidablecompetitor was the notorious gipsy the redoubtablestarlight tom i was rejoiced athaving an opportunity of seeing this minionof the moon in broad daylight i found himto be a tall swarthy goodlooking fellow witha lofty air something like i have seen in an indianchieftain and with a certain lounging easy andalmost graceful carriage which i have often remarkedin beings of the macaroni order thatlead an idle loitering life and have a gentlemanlikecontempt of labourmaster simon and the general reconnoitredthe ground together indulging a vast deal ofharmless raking among the buxom country girlsmaster simon would give some of them a kisson meeting with them and would ask after theirsisters for he is acquainted with most of the farmers'families sometimes he would whisperand affect to talk mischievously with them andif bantered on the subject would turn it off witha laugh though it was evident he liked to bemayday suspected of being a gay lothario amongstthemhe had much to say to the farmers about theirfarms and seemed to know all their horses bynamethere was an old fellow with a roundruddy face and a night cap under his hat whois the wit of the village and who took severaloccasions to crack a joke with master simon inthe hearing of his companions to whom hewould turn and wink hard when master simonhad passedthe harmony of the day however had nearlyat one time been interrupted by the appearanceof the radical on the ground with two or threeof his disciples he soon got engaged in argumentin the very thick of the throng abovewhich i could hear his voice and now and thensee his meagre hand half a mile out of thesleeve elevated in the air in violent gesticulationand flourishing a pamphlet by way of truncheonhe was decrying these idle nonsensical amusementsin times of public distress when it wasevery one's business to think of other matters maydayand to be miserable the honest village logicianscould make no stand against him especiallyas he was seconded by his proselytes when totheir great joy master simon and the generalgot embroiled in the discussion i saw that theformer rather entered into it with an ill gracefrom which i was persuaded that he must beforethis have had a brush with the radical but thegeneral was too loyal to suffer such talk in hishearing and thought no doubt that a look anda word from a gentleman would be sufficient toshut up so shabby an orator the latter howeverwas no respecter of persons but ratherseemed to exult in having such important antagonistshe talked with greater volubility thanever and soon drowned them in declamation onthe subject of taxes poor's rates and the nationaldebt master simon endeavoured tobrush along in his usual excursive manner whichhad always answered amazingly well with thevillagers but the radical was one of those pestilentfellows that pin a man down to facts andindeed he had two or three pamphlets in hismayday pocket to support every thing he advanced byprinted documents in a word the two worthiesfrom the hall were completely dumbfoundedand this too in the presence of several of mastersimon's staunch admirers who had alwayslooked up to him as infallible i do not knowhow he and the general would have managed todraw their forces decently from the field hadthere not been a match of grinning through ahorsecollar announced whereupon the radicalretired with great expression of contempt and assoon as his back was turned the argument wascarried against him all hollowin the latter part of the day the ladies fromthe hall paid a visit to the green the fairjulia made her appearance leaning on her lover'sarm and looking extremely pale andinteresting as she is a great favourite inthe village where she has been known fromchildhood and as her late accident had beenmuch talked about the sight of her caused verymanifest delight and some of the old women ofthe village blessed her sweet face as she passedvol ii maydaywhile they were walking about i noticed thelittle schoolmaster in earnest conversation withthe young girl that represented the queen ofmay evidently endeavouring to spirit her up tosome formidable undertaking at length as theparty from the hall approached her bower shecame forth faltering at every step until shereached the spot where the fair julia stood betweenher lover and lady lillycraft the littlequeen then took the chaplet of flowers fromher head and attempted to put it on that of thebride elect but the confusion of both was sogreat that the wreath would have fallen to theground had not the officer caught it andlaughing placed it upon the blushing brows ofhis mistress there was something charmingin the very embarrassment of these two youngcreatures both so beautiful yet so different intheir kinds of beauty master simon told meafterwards that the queen of may was to havespoken a few verses which the schoolmaster hadwritten for her but that she had neither wit tounderstand nor memory to recollect themmayday besides added he between you and i shemurders the king's

apprehension of oldready money himself who was very muchstruck by the intrepid interference of so prettyand delicate a girl and was sadly puzzled to understandthe meaning of the violent agitation inhis familywhen all this came to the ears of the squirehe was grievously scandalized that his maydayfete should have been disgraced by such a brawlhe ordered phoebe to appear before him but thegirl

almost as strange to them as theboors of la marcia were to the customs ofchivalry in the days of the valorous don quixoteindeed i considered it a proof of the discretionwith which the squire rides his hobbythat he had not pushed the thing any farthernor attempted to revive many obsolete usages ofthe day which in the present matteroffacttimes would appear affected and absurd i mustsay however though i do it under the rose thatthe general brawl in which this festival had nearlyterminated has made me doubt whether theserural customs of the good old times werealways so very loving and innocent as we

goodness of her heart kept her fromrunning continually into erroreven while a child her susceptibility wasevinced in an attachment which she formed to aplaymate eugene la forge the only son of awidow who lived in the neighbourhood theirchildish love was an epitome of maturer passion it had its caprices and jealousies and quarrelsand reconciliations it was assuming somethingof a graver character as annette entered her fifteenthand eugene his nineteenth year whenhe was suddenly carried off to the army by theconscription it was a heavy blow to his widowedmother for he was her only pride and comfort but it was one of those sudden bereavementswhich mothers were perpetually doomedto feel in france during the time that continualand bloody wars were incessantly draining heryouth it was a temporary affliction also to annetteto lose her lover with tender embraceshalf childish half womanish she parted fromhim the tears streamed from her blue eyes asshe bound a long braid of her fair hair round his annette delamerewrist but the smiles still broke through forshe was yet too young to feel how serious a thingis separation and how many chances there arewhen parting in this wide world against our evermeeting againweeks months years flew by annette increasedin beauty as she increased in years andwas the reigning belle of the neighbourhood hertime passed innocently and happily her fatherwas a man of some consequence in the ruralcommunity and his house was the resort of thegayest of the village annette held a kind of ruralcourt she was always surrounded by companionsof her own age among whom she shoneunrivalled much of their time was past inmaking lace the prevalent manufacture of theneighbourhood as they sat at this delicate andfeminine labour the merry tale and sprightlysong went round none laughed with a lighterheart than annette and if she sang her voicewas perfect melody their evenings were enlivenedby the dance or by those pleasant socialgames so prevalent among the french andannette delamere when she appeared at the village ball on sundayevenings she was the theme of universal admirationas she was a rural heiress she did not wantfor suitors many advantageous offers weremade her but she refused them all she laughedat the pretended pangs of her admirers andtriumphed over them with the caprice of buoyantyouth and conscious beauty with all herapparent levity however could any one haveread the story of her heart they might have tracedin it some fond remembrance of her earlyplaymate not so deeply graven as to be painful but too deep to be easily obliterated and theymight have noticed amidst all her gayety thetenderness that marked her manner towards themother of eugene she would often steal awayfrom her youthful companions and their amusementsto pass whole days with the good widow listening to her fond talk about her boy andblushing with secret pleasure when his letterswere read at finding herself a constant themeof recollection and inquiry annette delamereat length the sudden return of peice whichsent many a warrior to his native cottage broughtback eugene a young sunburnt soldier to thevillage i need not say how rapturously his returnwas greeted by his mother who saw inhim the pride and staff of her old age he hadrisen in the service by his merit but broughtaway little from the wars excepting a soldierlikeair a gallant name and a scar across theforehead he brought back however a natureunspoiled by the camp he was frank opengenerous and ardent his heart was quick andkind in its impulses and was perhaps a littlesofter from having suffered it was full of tendernessfor annette he had received frequentaccounts of her from his mother and the mentionof her kindness to his lonely parent hadrendered ner doubly dear to him he had beenwounded he had been a prisoner he had beenin various troubles but he had always preservedthe braid of her hair which she had bound roundhis arm it had been a kind of talisman tohim when wounded and in prison he had manyannette delamere a time looked upon it as he lay on the hardground and the thought that he might one daysee annette again and the fair fields about hisnative village had cheered his heart and enabledhim to bear up against every hardshiphe had left anne te almost a child he foundher a blooming woman if he had loved herbefore he now adored her annette was equallystruck with the improvement which time hadmade in her lover she noticed with secret admirationhis superiority to the other young menof the village the frank lofty military air thatdistinguished him from all the rest at their ruralgatherings the more she saw of him the moreher light playful fondness of former years deepenedinto ardent and powerful affection butannette was a rural belle she had tasted thesweets of dominion and had been renderedwilful and capricious by constant indulgence athome and admiration abroad she was consciousof her power over eugene and delightedin exercising it she sometimes treated himwith petulant caprice enjoying the pain whichvol ii annette delamereshe inflicted by her frowns from the idea howsoon she would chace it away again by hersmiles she took a pleasure in alarming hisfears by affecting a temporary preference to someoneor other of his rivals and then would delightin allaying them by an ample measure ofreturning kindness perhaps there was somedegree of vanity gratified by all this it might beamatter of triumph to show her absolute powerover the young soldier who was the universalobject of female admiration eugene howeverwas of too serious and ardent a nature to betrifled with he loved too fervently not to befilled with doubt he saw annette surroundedby admirers and full of animation the gayestamong the gay at all their rural festivitiesand apparently most gay when he was mostdejected every one saw through this capricebut himself every one saw that in reality shedoated on him but eugene alone suspected thesincerity of her affection for some time hebore this coquetry with secret impatience anddistrust but his feelings grew sore and irritableannette delamere and overcame his self command a slight misunderstandingtook place a quarrel ensuedannette unaccustomed to be thwarted and contradictedand full of the insolence of youthfulbeauty assumed an air of disdain she refusedall explanations to her lover and they parted inanger that very evening eugene saw her fullof gayety dancing with one of his rivals andas her eye caught his his fixed on her with unfeigneddistress it sparkled with more than usualvivacity it was a finishing blow to his hopesalready so much impaired by secret distrustpride and resentment both struggled in his breast and seemed to rouse his spirit to all its wontedenergy he retired from her presence withthe hasty determination never to see her againa woman is more considerate in affairs oflove than man because love is more the studyand business of her life annette soon repentedof her indiscretion she felt that she had usedher lover unkindly she felt that she had trifledwith his sincere and generous nature and thenhe looked so handsome when he parted after annette delameretheir quarrel his fine features lighted up by indignationshe had intended making up with himat the evening dance but his sudden departureprevented her she now promised herself thatwhen next they met she would amply repayhim by the sweets of a perfect reconciliationand that thenceforward she would never nevertease him more that promise was not to be fulfilled dayafter day passed but eugene did not make hisappearance sunday evening came the usualtime when all the gayety of the village assembledbut eugene was not there she inquiredafter him he had left the village she nowbecame alarmed and forgetting all coyness andaffected indifference called on eugene's motherfor an explanation she found her full of afflictionand learnt with surprise and consternationthat eugene had gone to seawhile his feelings were yet smarting withher affected disdain and his heart a prey to alternateindignation and despair he had suddenlyembraced an invitation which had repeatedlyannette delamere been made him by a relative who was fittingout a ship from the port of honfleur and whowished him to be the companion of his voyageabsence appeared to him the only cure for hisunlucky passion and in the temporary transportsof his feelings there was something gratifyingin the idea of having half the world intervenebetween them the hurry necessary forhis departure left no time for cool reflection itrendered him deaf to the remonstrances of hisafflicted mother he hastened to honfleur justintime to make the needful preparations for thevoyage and the first news that annette receivedof this sudden determination was a letter deliveredby his mother returning her pledges ofaffection particularly the long treasured braidof her hair and bidding her a last farewell interms more full of sorrow and tenderness thanupbraidingthis was the first stroke of real anguish thatannette had ever received and it overcame her the vivacity of her spirits were apt to hurry herto extremes she for a time gave way to ungo annette delamereenable transports of affliction and remorse anddiscovered by her violent exclamations the realardour of her affection the thought occurredto her that the ship might not yet have sailed she seized on the hope with eagerness and hastenedwith her father to honfleur the shiphad sailed that very morning from the heightsabove the town she saw it lessening to a speckon the broad bosom of the ocean and beforeevening the white sail had faded from her sightshe turned full of anguish to the neighbouringchapel of our lady of grace and throwingherself on the pavement poured out prayers andtears for the safe return of her loverwhen she returned home the cheerfulness ofher spirits was at an end she looked back withremorse and self upbraiding at her past caprices she turned with distaste from the adulation ofher admirers and had no longer any relish forthe amusements of the village with humiliationand diffidence she sought the widowed motherof eugene but was received by her withan overflowing heart for she only beheld in herannette delamere one who could sympathize in her doating fondnessfor her son it seemed some alleviation ofher remorse to sit by the mother all day tostudy her wants to beguile her heavy hours to hang about her with the caressing endearmentsof a daughter and to seek by every means if possibleto supply the place of the son whom shereproached herself with having driven awayin the mean time the ship made a prosperousvoyage to her destined port eugene's motherreceived a letter from him in which he lamentedthe precipitancy of his departure the voyagehad given him time for sober reflection if annettehad been unkind to him he ought not tohave forgotten what was due to his mother whowas now advanced in years he accused himselfof selfishness in only listening to the suggestionsof his own inconsiderate passions hepromised to return with the ship to make hismind up to his disappointment and to think ofnothing but making iii mother happy andwhen he does return said annette clasping her annette delamerehands with transport it shall not be tiny faultif he ever leaves us again the time approached for the ship's returnshe was daily expected when the weather becamedreadfully tempestuous day after daybrought news of vessels foundered or driven onshore and the sea coast was strewed withwrecks intelligence was received of the lookedfor ship having been seen dismasted in a violentstorm and the greatest fears were entertained forher safetyannette never left the side of eugene's mothershe watched every change of her countenancewith painful solicitude and endeavouredto cheer her with hopes while her own mindwas racked by anxiety she tasked her effortsto be gay but it was a forced and unnaturalgayety a sigh from the mother would completelycheck it and when she could no longerrestrain the rising tears she would hurry awayand pour out her agony in secretevery anxious look every anxious inquiry ofthe mother whenever a door opened or a strangeannette delamere face appeared was an arrow to her soul sheconsidered every disappointment as a pang of herown infliction and her heart sickened under thecareworn expression of the maternal eye atlength this suspense became insupportable sheleft the village and hastened to honfleur hopingevery hour every moment to receive some tidingsof her lover she paced the pier and weariedthe seamen of the port with her inquiries shemade a daily pilgrimage to the chapel of ourlady of grace hung votive garlands on thewall and passed hours either kneeling beforethe altar or looking out from the brow of thehill upon the angry seaat length word was brought that the longwished for vessel was in sight she was seenstanding into the mouth of the seine shatteredand crippled bearing marks of having been sadlytempest tost there was a general joy diffusedby her return and there was not a brighter eyenor a lighter heart than annette's in the littleport of honfleur the ship came to anchor inthe river and shortly after a boat put off for thevol ii annette delamereshore the populace crowded down to thepier head to welcome it annette stood blushingand smiling and trembling and weeping for a thousand painfully pleasing emotions agitatedher breast at the thoughts of the meetingand the reconciliation that was about to takeplace her heart throbbed to pour itself outand atone to her gallant lover for all its errorsher agitation increased as the boat drew near until it became distressing at one momentshe placed herself in a conspicuous place whereshe might at once catch his view and surprizehim by her welcome the next moment sheshrunk among the throng trembling and faintand gasping with her emotionsit was almost a relief to her when she perceivedthat her lover was not in the boat shepresumed that he had remained on board to preparefor his return home and she felt as if thedelay would enable her to gather more selfpossession for the meeting as the boat was nearingthe shore there were a thousand inquiriesmade and laconic answers returned at lengthannette delamere annette heard some one inquire after her loverher heart palpitated there was a moment'spause the reply was brief but awful he hadbeen washed from the deck with two of thecrew in the midst of a stormy night when itwas impossible to render any assistance apiercing shriek broke from among the crowdand annette had nearly fallen into the wavesthe sudden revulsion of feelings after suchwearing anxiety was too much for her frameshe was carried home senseless her life wasfor some time despaired of and it was monthsbefore she recovered her health but she neverhad perfectly recovered her mind it still remainedunsettled with respect to her lover'sfatethe subject continued my informer isnever mentioned in her hearing but she sometimesspeaks of it and it seems as though therewere some vague train of impressions in hermind in which hope and fear are strangelymingled some imperfect idea of his shipwreckand yet some expectation of his returnannette delamereher parents have tried every means to cheerher up and to banish these gloomy images fromher thoughts they assemble round her theyoung companions in whose society she used todelight and they will work and chat and singand laugh as formerly but she will sit silentlyamong them and will sometimes weep in themidst of their gayety and if spoken to willmake no reply but look up with streaming eyesand sing a dismal little song which she has learntsomewhere about a shipwreck it makes everyone'sheart ache to see her in this way for sheused to be the happiest creature in the villageshe passes the greater part of the time witheugene's mother whose only consolation is hersociety and who doats on her with a mother'stenderness she is the only one that has perfectinfluence over annette in every mood thepoor girl seems as formerly to make an effort tobe cheerful in her company but will sometimesgaze upon her with the most piteous look andthen put back her cap and kiss her gray hairsand fall on her neck and weepannette delamere she is not always melancholy however she has occasional intervals when she will bebright and animated for days together but thereis a degree of wildness attending these fits ofgayety that prevents their yielding any encouragementto her friends at such times she willarrange her room which is all covered with picturesof ships and legends of saints and willwreath a white chaplet as if for a wedding andprepare wedding ornaments she will listenanxiously at the door and look frequently at thewindow as if expecting some one s arrival itis supposed that at such times she is looking forher lover's return but as no one touches uponthe theme or mentions his name in her presencethe current of her thoughts are for the most partmerely conjecturenow and then she will rriake a pilgrimageto the chapel of notre dame de grace whereshe will pray for hours at the altar and decoratethe images with wreaths that she has woven orwill wave her handkerchief from the terrace annette delamereas you have seen if there is any vessel to beseen in the distancenearly two years he informed me hadnow elapsed without effacing from her mindthis singular taint of insanity still her friendshoped it might gradually wear away theyhad at one time removed her to a distant part ofthe country in hopes that absence from the scenesconnected with her story might have a salutaryeffect but when her periodical melancholy returnedshe became more restless and wretchedthan usual and privately escaping from herfriends set out on foot without knowing theroad on one of her pilgrimages to the chapelthis little story entirely drew my attentionfrom the gay scene of the fete and fixed it uponthe beautiful

thatshe w r ould now return home and in all probabilitybe calm and cheerful for days and evenweeks in which time it was supposed that hopepredominated in her mental malady and thatwhen the dark side of her mind as her friendscalled it was about to turn up it would be knownby her neglecting her distaff or her lace singingplaintive songs and weeping in silenceshe passed on from the chapel without

beaten route atrouen to revisit some of the most striking scenesof lower normandy has ing passed throughthe lovely country of the pays d'ange i reachedhonfleur on a fine afternoon intending tocross to havre the next morning and embark forengland as i had no other way of passingthe evening i strolled up the hill to enjoy thefine prospect from the chapel of notre dame degrace and while there i thought of inquiringafter the fate of poor annette delarbre thepriest who had told me her story was officiatingat vespers after which i accosted him and learntfrom him the remaining circumstanceshe told me that from the time i had seen heratthe chapel her disorder took a sudden turn forthe worse and her health rapidly declined hercheerful intervals became shorter and less freedelamere quest and attended with more incoherency shegrew languid silent and moody in her melancholy her form was wasted her looks paleand disconsolate and it was feared she wouldnever recover she became impatient of allsounds of gayety and was never so contentedas when eugene's mother was near her thegood woman watched over her with patient andyearning solicitude and in seeking to beguileher sorrows would half forget her own sometimesas she sat looking upon her pallid face thetears would fill her eyes which when annetteperceived she would anxiously wipe them awayand tell her not to grieve for that eugene wouldsoon return and then she would affect a forcedgayety as in former times and sing a lively air but a sudden recollection would come over herand she would burst into tears hang on the poormother's neck and entreat her not to curse herfor having destroyed her sonjust at this time to the astonishment of everyonenews was received of eugene who it appearedwas still living when almost drowned annette delamerehe had fortunately seized upon a spar which hadbeen washed from the ship's deck findinghimself nearly exhausted he had fastened himselfto it and floated for a day and a night until allsense had left him on recovering he had foundhimself on board a vessel bound to india but soill as not to move without assistance his healthhad continued precarious throughout the voyageon arriving in india he had experienced manyvicissitudes and had been transferred from shipto ship and hospital to hospital his constitutionhad enabled him to struggle through everyhardship and he was now in a distant portwaiting only for the sailing of a ship to returnhomegreat caution was necessary in impartingthese tidings to the mother and even then shewas nearly overcome by the transports of herjoy but how to impart them to annette was amatter of still greater perplexity her state ofmind had been so morbid she had been subject tosuch violent changes and the cause of her derangementhad been of such an inconsolableannette delamere and hopeless kind that her friends had alwaysforbore to tamper with her feelings they hadnever even hinted at the subject of her griefs nor encouraged the theme when she adverted toit but had passed it over in silence hoping thattime would gradually wear the traces of it fromher recollection or at least would render themless painful they now felt at a loss how to undeceiveher even in her misery lest the suddenrecurrence of happiness might confirm the estrangementof her reason or might overpowerher enfeebled frame they ventured howeverto probe those wounds which they formerly didnot dare to touch for they now had the balm topour into them they led the conversation tothose topics which they had hitherto shunned and endeavoured to ascertain the current of herthoughts in those varying moods that had formerlyperplexed them they found howeverthat her mind was even more affected than theyhad imagined all her ideas were confused andwandering her bright and cheerful moodswhich now grew seldom than ever were all annette delamerethe effects of mental delusion at such timesshe had no recollection of her lover's havingbeen in danger but was only anticipating

her of what shehad said in her gayer moments and to assureher that eugene would indeed return shortlyshe wept on in silence and appeared insensible totheir words but at times her agitation

for herthan ever for they feared that her senses wereannette delamere irrecoverably gone and her constitution completelyunderminedin the mean time eugene returned to the villagehe was violently affected when the storyof annette was told him with bitterness ofheart he upbraided his own rashness and infatuationthat had hurried him away from her andaccused himself as the author of all her woeshis mother would describe to him all the anguishand remorse of poor annette the tendernesswith which she clung to her and endeavouredeven in the midst of her insanity toconsole her for the loss of her son and thetouching expressions of affection that weremingled with her most incoherent wanderingsof thought until his feelings would be woundup to agony and he would intreat her to desistfrom the recital they did not dare as yet tobring him into annette's sight but he was permittedto see her when she was sleeping thetears streamed down his sunburnt cheeks as hecontemplated the ravages which grief and maladyhad made and his heart swelled almost to annette delamerebreaking as he beheld round her neck the verybraid of hair which she once gave him in tokenof girlish affection and which he had returnedto her in angerat length the physician that attended her determinedto adventure upon an experiment totake advantage of one of those cheerful moodswhen her mind was visited by hope and to endeavourto engraft as it were the reality uponthe delusions of her fancy these moods hadnow become very rare for nature was sinkingunder the continual pressure of her mentalmalady and the principle of reaction was dailygrowing weaker every effort was tried tobring on a cheerful interval of the kind severalof her most favourite companions were keptcontinually about her they chatted gayly they

talked of the return of eugeneas a matter of course they congratulatedher upon her approaching happiness and assistedher in her preparations the next morningthe same theme was resumed she was

the room and advanced towardsher she looked at him with an eager searchinglook murmured some indistinct words and beforehe could reach her sunk upon the floorshe relapsed into a wild and unsettled state ofmind butnow that the first shock was over thephysician ordered that eugene should keep continuallyin her sight sometimes she did notknow him at other times she would talk to himas if he were going to sea and would implorehim not to part from her in anger and when hewas not present she would speak of him as buriedin the ocean and would sit with clasped handslooking upon the ground the picture of despairas the agitation of her feelings subsided andher frame recovered from the shock which ithad received she became more placid and coherenteugene kept almost continually near herhe formed the real object round which her annette delameretered ideas once more gathered and which linkedthem once mor with the realities of life buther changeful disorder now appeared to take anew turn she became languid and inert andwould sit for hours silent and almost in a state oflethargy if roused from this stupor it seemedas if her mind would make some attempts tofollow up a train of thought but soon becameconfused she would regard every one that approachedher with an anxious and inquiring eyethat seemed continually to disappoint itselfsometimes as her lover sat holding her hand shewould look pensively in his face without sayinga word until his heart was overcome and afterthese transient fits of intellectual exertion shewould sink again into lethargyby degrees this stupor increased her mindappeared to have subsided into a stagnant andalmost deathlike calm for the greater part ofthe time her eyes were closed her face almostas fixed and passionless as that of acorpse she no longer took any notice ofsurrounding objects there was an awfulnessannette delamere in this tranquillity that filled her friends withapprehension the physician ordered that sheshould be kept perfectly quiet or that if sheevinced any agitation she should be gently lulledlike a child by some favourite tuneshe remained in this state for hours hardlyseeming to breathe and apparently sinking intothe sleep of death her chamber was profoundlystill the attendants moved about itwith noiseless tread every thing was communicatedby signs and whispers her lover sat byher side watching her with painful anxiety andfearing that every breath which stole from herpale lips would be the lastat length she heaved a deep sigh and fromsome convulsive motions appeared to be troubledin her sleep her agitation increased accompaniedby an indistinct moaning one ofher companions remembering the physician's instructionsendeavoured to lull her by singingin a low voice a tender little air which was aparticular favourite of annette's probably ithad some connection in her mind with her story annette delamerefor every fond girl has some ditty of the kindlinked in her thoughts with sweet and sad remembrancesas she sang the agitation of annette subsideda streak of faint colour came into hercheeks her eyelids became swoln with risingtears w r which trembled there for a moment andthen stealing forth coursed down her pallidcheek when the song was ended she openedher eyes and looked about her as one awakingin a strange placeoh eugene eugene said she it seemsas if i have had a long and dismal dream whathas happened and what has been the matterwith me the questions were embarrassing and beforethey could be answered the physician who wasin the next room entered she took him by thehand looked up in his face and made the sameinquiry he endeavoured to put her off withsome evasive answer no no cried shei know i've been ill and i have been dreamingstrangely i thought eugene had left us andannette delamere that

reached the front of thehouse they were brought to a halt by a kind ofadvanced guard composed of old christy thegamekeeper and two or three servants of thehouse who had been brought out by the

surrounded by the tailor theschoolmaster and several other dignitaries of thethe culpritvillage and by the clamorous brood of gipsieswho were neither to be silenced nor intimidatedby this time the whole household were broughtto the doors and windows and the squire to theportal an audience was demanded by readymoney jack who had detected the prisoner inthe very act of sheep stealing on his domainsand had borne him off to be examined beforethe squire who is in the commission of thepeacea kind of tribunal was immediately held inthe servant's hall a large chamber with a stonefloor and a long table in the centre at one endof which just under an enormous clock wasplaced the squire's chair of justice while mastersimon took his place at the table as clerk ofthe court an attempt had been made by oldchristy to keep out the gipsy gang but in vain and they with the village worthies and thehousehold half filled the hall the old housekeeperand the butler were in a panic at this

commanded by master simonbut it was difficult to be enforced in such a mostlyassemblage there was a continual snarlingand yelping of dogs and as fast as it was quelledin one corner it broke out in

resistance the very curs of my lady lillycraftbullied them with impunitythe culprit the examination was conducted with greatmildness and indulgence by the squire partlyfrom the kindness of his nature and partly isuspect because his heart yearned towards theculprit who as i have before mentioned hadfound great favour in his eyes from the skill hehad at various times displayed in archery morricedancing and other obsolete accomplishmentsproofs however were too strong readymoney jack told his story in a straight forwardindependent way nothing daunted by the presencein which he found

his side seekingthe culprit every now and then by a soft word to soothe anyexacerbation of his ire or to qualify any harshexpression he now ventured to make a fewobservations to the squire in palliation of thedelinquent's offences but poor slingsbyby spokemore from the heart than the head and was evidentlyactuated merely by a general sympathyfor any poor devil in trouble and a liberal tolerationfor all kinds of vagabond existencethe ladies too large and small with thekindheartedness of the sex were zealous on theside of mercy and interceded strenuously withthe squire insomuch that the prisoner findinghimself unexpectedly surrounded by activefriends once more reared his crest and seemeddisposed for a time to put on the airs of injuredinnocence the squire however with all hisbenevolence of heart and his lurking weaknesstowards the prisoner was too conscientiousto swerve from the strict path of justice therewas abundant concurring testimony that madethe proof of guilt incontrovertible and starlighttom's mittimus was made out accordingly the culpritthe sympathy of the ladies was now greaterthan ever they even made some attempts tomollify the ire of ready money jack but thatsturdy potentate had been too much incensedby the repeated incursions that had been madeinto his territories by the predatory band ofstarlight tom and he was resolved he saidto drive the

intercedingfriend slingsbyby and followed by a detachmentof the gipsy gang who hung on his rear assailinghim with mingled prayers and declarationsthe question now was how to dispose of theprisoner a matter of great moment in thispeaceful establishment where so formidable acharacter as starlight torn was like a hawkentrapped in a dove cote as the hubbub andexamination had occupied a considerable

some of them were rather hackneyedand tedious and others i did not feel warrantedin betraying into print i was suddenly startledlately by a call from the squire to furnish a storyin my turn and having been a profound listenerto those of others i could not in conscience refuse so i begged leave to read a manuscript talefrom the pen of the late mr heinrich knickerbockerthe historian of new yorkas some curiosity was expressed about the authori had to explain that he was a native ofnew york a descendant of one of the ancientdutch families that originally settled that provinceand remained there after it was takenpossession of by the english in thatthe historian sthe descendants of these dutch families still remainedin villages and neighbourhoods in variousparts of the country retaining with singularfidelity the dresses manners and even languageof their ancestors and forming a very distinctand curious feature in the population of thestatethat mr knickerbocker had written a historyof his native city comprising the reign of thethree first governors who held a delegated swayunder the hogen moyens of holland that inthis the worthy little dutchman had displayedgreat historical research and a wonderful senseof the dignity of his subject but that his workhad been so little understood as to be pronounceda mere work of humour satirizing the folliesof the times in politics and morals and givingwhimsical views of human naturethat among the papers left behind him wereseveral tales of a lighter nature apparentlythrown together from materials which he hadgathered during his profound researches for hishistory and which he seemed to have thrown the historianby with neglect as unworthy of publicationthat these had fallen into my hands by an accidentwhich it was needless to mention and oneof those stories with its prelude in the words ofmr knickerbocker i now undertook to readby way of acquitting myself of the debt whichi owed to the other storytellers in companythe haunted housefrom the mss of the late heinrich knickerbockerformerly almost every place had a house of this kind if a housewas seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romanticmanner or if any particular accident had happened in it suchas murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had amark set on it and was afterwards esteemed the habitation of abourne s antiquitiesin the neighbourhood of the ancient city ofmanhattoes there stood not very many yearssince an old mansion which when i was a boywent by the name of the haunted house it wasone of the very few remains of the architectureof the early dutch settlers and must have beena house of some consequence at the time whenit was built it consisted of a centre and twowings the gable ends of which were shapedlike stairs it was built partly of wood and the haunted housepartly of small dutch bricks such as the worthycolonists brought with them from holland before they discovered that bricks could bemanufactured elsewhere the house stood remotefrom the road in the centre of a largefield with an avenue of old locust trees leadingup to it several of which had been shiveredby lightning and two or three blown downa few apple trees grew straggling about thefield there were traces also of what had beena kitchen garden but the fences were brokendown the vegetables had disappeared or hadgrown wild and turned to little better thanweeds with here and there a ragged rose bushor a tall sunflower shooting up from among thebrambles and hanging its head sorrowfully asif contemplating the desolation around it partof the roof of the old house had fallen in thewindows were shattered the pannels of thedoors broken and mended with rough boards and there were two rusty weathercocks at theends of the house which made a great jinglingacaciasthe haunted house and whistling as they whirled about but alwayspoiutecl wrong the appearance of the wholewas forlorn and desolate at the best of times but in unruly weather the howling of the windabout the crazy old mansion the screeching ofthe weathercocks the slamming and bangingof a few loose window shutters had altogetherso wild and dreary an effect that the neighbourhoodstood perfectly in awe of the place andpronounced it the rendezvous of hobgoblins irecollect the old building well for i recollecthow many times when an idle unlucky urchini have prowled round its precincts with someof my graceless companions on holyday afternoonswhen out on a freebooting cruise amongthe orchardsthere was a tree standing near the housethat bore the most beautiful and tempting fruit but then it was on enchanted ground for theplace was so charmed by frightful stories that wedreaded to approach it sometimes we wouldventure in a body and get near the hesperiantree keeping an eye upon the old mansion and the haunted housedarting fearful glances into its shattered windows when just as we were about tf seizeupon our prize an exclamation from some oneof the gang or an accidental noise would throwus all into a panic and we wo old scamper headlongfrom the place nor ever stop until we hadgot quite into the road then there were sureto be a host of anecdotes told about strangecries and groans or of some hideous face suddenlyseen staring out of one of the windowsby degrees we ceased to venture into these lonelygrounds but would stand at a distance andthrow stones at the building and there was somethingfearfully pleasing in the sound as theyrattled along the roof or sometimes struck somejingling fragments of glass out of the windowsthe origin of the house was lost in the obscuritythat covers the early period of the provincewhilst under the government of their highmightiness the states general some reportedit to have been a country residence of wilhelmkieft commonly called the testy one ofthe dutch governors of newamsterdam othersthe haunted house said that it had been built by a naval commanderwho served under van tromp and who onbeing disappointed of preferment retired fromthe service in disgust became a philosopherthrough sheer spire and brought over all hiswealth to the province that he might live accordingto his humour and despise the world thereason of its having fallen to decay was likewisea matter of dispute some said that it was inchancery and had already cost more than itsworth in legal expenses but the most currentand of course the most probable account wasthat it was haunted and that nobody could livequietly in it there can in fact be very littledoubt that this last was the case there were somany corroborating stories to prove it riot anold woman in the neighbourhood but could furnishat least a score there was a gray headedcurmudgeon of a negro that lived hard by whohad a whole budget of them

spent in hearing and telling thenews of the province he recollected old poipey and his stories about the haunted house but he assured me he could give me one stillmore strange than any that pompey had

comfort for of all unlucky urchinsdolph heyliger was the most mischievous notthat the whisper was really vicious he wasonly full of fun and frolick and had that daringgamesome spirit which is extolled in a rich man'schild but execrated in a poor man's he wascontinually getting into scrapes his mother wasincessantly harassed with complaints of somewaggish prank which he had played off billswere sent in for windows that he had broken invol it s adolph heyligeka word he had not reached his fourteenth yearbefore he was pronounced by all the neighbourhoodto be a wicked dog the wickedest dogin the street nay one old gentleman in aclaret coloured coat with a thin red face andferret eyes went so far as to assure dame heytigerthat her son would one day or other cometo the gallows yet notwithstanding all this the poor old soulloved her boy it seemed as though she lovedhim the better the worse he behaved and thathe grew more in her favour the more he grewout of favour with the world mothers arefoolish fond hearted beings there's no reasoningthem out of their dotage and indeed thispoor woman's child was all that was left to loveher in this world so w e must not think it hardthat she turned a deaf ear to her good friendswho sought to prove to her that dolph must inevitablycome to a halter to do the varlet justicetoo he was strongly attached to his parenthe would not willingly have given her pain onany account and when he had been doing wrongadolph heyliger it was but foe him to catch his poor mother's eyefixed wistfully and sorrowfully upon him to fillhis heart with bitterness and contrition but hewas a heedless youngster and could not for thelife of him resist any new temptation to fun andmischief though quick at his learning wheneverhe could be brought to apply himself yet hewas always prone to be led away by idle company and would play truant to hunt after bird'snests to rob orchards or to swim in the hudsonin this way he grew up a tall lubberly boyand his mother began to be greatly perplexedwhat to do with him or how to put him in away to do for himself for he had acquired suchan unlucky reputation that no one seemed willingto employ him many was the consultationthat she held with peter de groodt the clerkand sexton who was her prime councillorpeter was as much perplexed as herself for hehad no great opinion of the boy and thought hewould never come to good he at one timeadvised her to send him to sea a piece of advice adolph heyligeronly given in the most desperate cases but dameheyliger would not listen to such an idea shecould not think of letting dolph go out of hersight she was sitting one day knitting by herfireside in great perplexity when the sextonentered with an air of unusual vivacity and brisknesshe had just come from a funeral it hadbeen that of a boy of dolph's years who hadbeen apprentice to a famous german doctorwho had died of a consumption it is true therehad been a whisper that the deceased had beenbrought to his end by being made the subject ofthe doctor's experiments on which he was aptto try the effects of a new compound or a quietingdraught this however it is likely was amere scandal at any rate peter de groodt didnot think it worth mentioning though had wetime to philosophize it would be a curious matterfor speculation why a doctor's family is aptto be so lean and cadaverous and a butcher's sojolly and rubicundpeter de groodt as i said before entered thehouse of dame heyliger with unusual alacrityadolph heyliger he was full of a bright idea that had poppedinto his head at the funeral and over which hehad chuckled as he shovelled the earth into thegrave of the doctor's disciple it had occurredto him thar as the situation of the deceased wasvacant at the doctor's it would be the veryplace for dolph the boy had parts and couldpound a pestle and run an errand with any boy inthe town and what more was wanted in a studentthe suggestion of the sage peter was a visionof glory to the mother she already saw dolphinher mind's eye with a cane at his nose aknocker at his door and an m d at the endof his name one of the established dignitaries ofthe town the matter once undertaken was soon effected the sexton had some influence with thedoctor they having had much dealing togetherin the way of their separate professions andthe very next morning he called and conductedthe urchin clad in his sunday clothes to undergo adolph heyligerthe inspection of doctor karl lodovich knipperhausenthey found the doctor seated in an elbowchair in one corner of his study or laboratorywith a large volume in german print before himhe was a short fat man with a dark squarelace rendered more dark by a black velvet caphe had a little robbed nose not unlike the aceof spades with a pair of spectacles gleamingon each side of his dusky countenance like acouple of bow windowsdolph felt struck with awe on entering intothe presence of this learned man and gazedabout him with boyish wonder at the furnitureof this chamber of knowledge which appearedto him almost as the den of a magician in thecentre stood a claw footed table with pestle andmortar phials and galli pots and a pair of smallburnished scales at one end was a heavyclothes press turned into a receptacle for drugsand compounds against which hung the doctor'shat and cloak and goldheaded cane and onthe top grinned a human scull along the randolphheyliger timepiece were glass vessels holding snakes andlizards and a human foetus preserved in spiritsa closet the doors of which were taken offcontained three whole shelves full of books andsome too of mighty folio dimensions a collectionthe like of which dolph had never beforebeheld as however the library did nottake up the whole of the closet the doctor'sthrifty housekeeper had occupied the rest withpots of pickles and preserves and had hungabout the room among awful implements of thehealing art strings of red peppers and corpulentcucumbers carefully preserved for seedpeter de groodt and his protege were receivedwith great gravity and stateliness by thedoctor who was a very wise dignified littleman and never smiled he surveyed dolphfrom head to foot above and under and throughhis spectacles and the poor lad's heart quailed asthese great glasses glared on him like two fullmoons the doctor heard all that peter degroodt had to say in favour of the youthful candidate and then wetting his thumb with the adolph belligerentof his tongue he began deliberately to turnoverpage after page of the great black volumebefore him at length after many hums andhaws and stroking of the chin and all that hesitationand deliberation with which a wise manproceeds to do what he intended to do from thevery first the doctor agreed to take the lad as adisciple to give him bed board and clothingand to instruct him in the healing art in returnfor which he was to have his services until histwentyfirst year behold then our hero all atonce transformed from an unlucky urchin runningwild about the streets to a student of medicinediligently pounding a pestle under the auspicesof the learned doctor karl lodovichknipperhauseri it was a happy transition forhis fond old mother she was delighted withthe idea of her boy's being brought up worthyof his ancestors and anticipated the day whenhe would be able to hold up his head with thelawyer that lived in the large door opposite orperadventure with the dominie himselfadolph heyliger doctor knipperhausen was a native of the palatinatein germany from whence in companywith many of his countrymen he had taken refugein england on account of religious persecutionhe was one of nearly three thousandpalatines who came over from england in under the protection of governor hunter wherethe doctor had studied how he had acquiredhis medical knowledge and where he had receivedhis diploma it is hard at present to sayfor nobody knew at the time yet it is certainthat his profound skill and abstruse knowledgewere the talk and wonder of the common peoplefar and near his practice was totally differentfrom that of any other physician consistingin mysterious compounds known only to himselfin the preparing and administering ofwhich it was said he always consulted the starsso high an opinion was entertained of his skillparticularly by the german and dutch inhabitantsthat they always resorted to him in desperatecases he was one of those infallible doctorsthat are always effecting sudden and surpriseii adolph heyligersing cures when the patient has been given upby all the regular physicians unless as isshrewdly observed the case has been left toolong before it was put into his hands thedoctor's library was the talk and marvel of theneighbourhood i might almost say of the entireburgh the good people looked with reverenceat a man that had read three whole shelves fullof books and some of them too as large as afamily bible there were many disputes amongthe members of the little lutheran church asto which was the wisest man the doctor or thedominie some of his admirers even went so faras to say that he knew more than the governorhimself in a word it was thought that therewas no end to his knowledge no sooner was dolph received into the doctor'sfamily than he was put in possession of thelodgings of his predecessor it was a garretroom of a steep roofed dutch house where therain pattered on the shingles and the lightninggleamed arid the wind piped through the cranniesin stormy weather and where whole troopsadolph heyligeiu of hungry rats galloped about like don cossacksin defiance of traps and ratsbanehe was soon up to his ears in medical studiesbeing employed morning noon and night inrolling pills filtering tinctures or pounding thepestle and mortar in one corner of the laboratory while the doctor would take his seat inanother corner when he had nothing else to doorexpected visitors and arrayed in his morninggown and velvet cap would pore over the contentsof some folio volume it is true that theregular thumping of dolph's pestle or perhapsthe drowsy buzzing of the summer flies wouldnow and then lull the little man into a slumber but then his spectacles were always wide awakeand studiously regarding the bookthere was another personage in the househowever to whom dolph was obliged to payallegiance though a bachelor and a man ofsuch great dignity and importance yet the doctorwas like many other wise men subject topetticoat goverment he was completely underthe sway of his housekeeper a spare busy adolph heyligerfretting housewife in a little round

precious bit of news nay shewould sometimes discuss a whole volume of secrethistory as she held the street door ajar andgossiped with one of those garrulous cronesin the very teeth of a december blastbetween the doctor and the housekeeper itmay easily be supposed that dolph had a busylife of it as frau f isy kept the keys and literallyruled the roast it was starvation to offendher though he found the study of her tempermore perplexing even than that of medicinewhen not busy in the laboratory she kept himrunning hither and thither on her own errands and on sundays he was obliged to

heyligerand her cronies were huddled together waggingtheir heads and tearing some unlucky characterto pieceswith allhis advantages however dolph madebut very slow progress in his art this was nofault of the doctor's certainly for he took unweariedpains with the lad keeping him closeto the pestle and mortar or on the trot abouttown with phials and pillboxes and if he everflagged in his industry which he was rather aptto do the doctor would fly into a passion andask him if he ever expected to learn his professionunless he applied himself closer to the studythe fact is he still retained the fondness forsport and mischief that had marked his childhoodthe habit indeed strengthened with hisyears and gained force from being thwarted andconstrained he daily grew more and more untractable and lost favour in the eyes both of thedoctor and the housekeeperin the mean time the doctor went on waxingwealthy and renowned he was famous for hisskill in managing cases not laid down in theadolph heyliger books he had cured several old women andyoung girls of witchcraft a terrible complaintnearly as prevalent in the province in those daysas hydrophobia is at present he had even restoredone strapping country girl to perfect healthwho had gone so far as to vomit crooked pinsand needles which is considered a desperatestage of the malady it was whispered alsothat he was possessed of the art of preparinglove ponders and many applications had he inconsequencefrom lovesick patients of bothsexes but all these cases formed the mysteriouspart of his practice in which according to thecant phrase secrecy and honour might bedepended on dolph therefore was obliged toturn out of the study when such consultationsoccurred though it is said he learnt more of thesecrets of the art at the key hole than by all therest of his studies put togetheras the doctor increased in wealth he began toextend his possessions and to look forward likeother great men to the time when he should retireto the repose of a country seat for thisadolph heyligekpurpose he had purchased a farm or as thedutch settlers called it a bower a few milesfrom town it had been the residence of a wealthyfamily that had returned some time since toholland a large mansion house stood in thecentre of it very much out of repair and whichin consequence of certain reports had receivedthe appellation of the haunted house eitherfrom these reports or from its actual drearinessthe doctor had found it impossible to get a tenantand that the place might not fall to ruinbefore he could reside in it himself he had placeda country boor with his family in one wingwith the privilege of cultivating the farm onsharesthe doctor now felt all the dignity of a landholderrising within him he had a little of thegerman pride of territory in his compositionand almost looked upon himself as owner of aprincipality he began to complain of the fatigueof business and was fond of riding outto look at his estate his little expeditionsto his lands were attended with a bustle and paadolphheyliger rade that created a sensation throughout theneighbourhood his walleyed horse stood stampingand whisking off the flies for a full hour beforethe house then the doctor's saddle bagswould be brought out and adjusted then aftera little while his cloak would be rolled up andstrapped to the saddle then his umbrella wouldbe buckled to the cloak while in the meantimea group of ragged boys that observantclass of beings would gather before the doorat length the doctor would issue forth in a pairof jack boots that reached above his knees anda cocked hat flapped down in front as he wasa short fat man he took some time to mountinto the saddle and when there he took sometimeto have the saddle and stirrups properlyadjusted enjoying the wonder and admirationof the urchin crowd even after he had setoff he would pause in the middle of the streetor trot back two or three times to give someparting orders which were answered by thehousekeeper from the door or dolph from thestudy or the black cook from the cellar or thevol n adolph heyligerchambermaid from the garret window andthere were generally some last words bawledafter him just as he was turning the cornerthe whole neighbourhood would be arousedby this pomp and circumstance the cobblerwould leave his last the barber would thrustout his frizzed head with a comb sticking in itaknot would collect at the grocer's door andthe word would be buzzed from one end of thestreet to the other the doctor's riding out tohis country seat these were golden moments for dolph nosooner was the doctor out of sight than pestleand mortar were abandoned the laboratory wasleft to take care of itself and the student wasoff on some madcap frolick indeed it must beconfessed the youngster as he grew up seemedin a fair way to fulfil the prediction of the oldclaret coloured gentleman he was the ringleaderof all holyday sports and midnight gambols ready for all kinds of mischievous pranksand harebrained adventure there is nothingso troublesome as a hero on a small scale oroolph heyliger rather a hero in a small town dolph soon becamethe abhorrence of all drowsy housekeepingold citizens who hated noise and had no relishfor waggery the good dames too consideredhim as little better than a reprobate gathered their daughters under their wingswhenever he approached and pointed him outas a warning to their sons no one seemed tohold him in much regard excepting the wildstriplings of the place who were captivated byhis openhearted daring manners and the negroeswho always look upon every idle donothing youngster as a kind of gentleman eventhe good peter de groodt who had consideredhimself a kind of patron of the lad began todespair of him and would shake his head dubiouslyas he listened to a long complaint of thehousekeeper's and sipped a glass of her raspberrybrandystill his mother was not to be wearied outof her affection by all the waywardness of herboy nor disheartened by the stories of his misdeedswith which her good friends were adolph heyligerannually regaling her she had it is true verylittle of the pleasure which rich people enjoyin always hearing their children praised butshe considered all this ill will as a kind of persecutionwhich he suffered and she liked himthe better on that account she saw him growingup a fine tall good looking youngster andshe looked at him with the secret pride of a mother'sheart it was her great desire that dolphshould appear like a gentleman and all the moneyshe could save went towards helping outhis pocket and his wardrobe she would lookoutof the window after him as he sallied forthin his best and her heart would yearn with delight and once when peter de groodt struckwith the youngster's gallant appearance on abright sunday morning observed well afterall dolph does grow a comely fellow thetear of pride started into the mother's eye ahneighbour neighbour exclaimed she theymay say what they please poor dolph will yethold up his head with the best of them dolph heyliger had now nearly attained hisadolph heyliger oneandtwentieth year and the term of hismedical studies was just expiring yet it mustbe confessed that he knew little more of the professionthan when he first entered the doctor'sdoors this however could not be from anywant of quickness of parts for he showed amazingaptness in mastering other branches ofknowledge which he could only have studied atintervals he was for instance a sure marksmanand won all the geese and turkeys at christmasholidays he was a bold rider he wasfamous for leaping and wrestling he played tolerablyon the fiddle could swim like a fishand was the best hand in the whole place atfives and ninepinsall these accomplishments however procuredhim no favour in the eyes of the doctor whogrew more and more crabbed and intolerant thenearer the term of apprenticeship approachedfrau ilsyy too was forever finding some occasionto raise a windy tempest about his ears and seldom encountered him about the housewithout a clatter of the tongue so that at length adolph heyligerthe jingling of her keys as she approached wasto dolph like the ringing of the prompter's bellthat gives notice of a theatrical thunder stormnothing but the infinite good humour of theheedless youngster enabled him to bear all thisdomestic tyranny without open rebellion itwas evident that the doctor and his housekeeperwere preparing to beat the poor youth out of thenest the moment his term should have expired a shorthand mode which the doctor had of providingfor useless disciplesindeed the little man had been rendered morethan usually irritable lately in consequence ofvarious cares and vexations which his countryestate had brought upon him the doctor hadbeen repeatedly annoyed by the rumours andtales which prevailed concerning the old mansionand found it difficult to prevail even uponthe countryman and his family to remain thererent free every time he rode out to the farmhe was teased by some fresh complaint of strangenoises and fearful sights with which the tenantswere disturbed at night and the doctor wouldadolph meyliger come home fretting arid fuming and vent hisspleen upon the whole household it was indeeda sore grievance that affected him both inpride and purse he was threatened with anabsolute loss of the profits of his property andthen what a blow to his territorial consequenceto be the landlord of a haunted house it wasobserved however that with all his vexationthe doctor never proposed to sleep in the househimself nay he could never be prevailed uponto remain on the premises after dark but madethe best of his way for town as soon as the batsbegan to flit about in the twilight the factwas the doctor was a secret

undertook to garrison the haunted housethe youngster had been listening to all the stonesof claus hopper and peter de groodt hewas fond of adventure he loved the marvellous and his imagination had become quite excitedby these tales of wonder besides he hadled such an uncomfortable life at the doctor'sbeing subjected to the intolerable thraldom ofearly hours that he was delighted at the prospectof having a house to himself even though itshould be a haunted one his offer was eagerlyaccepted and it was determined that he shouldmount guard that very night his only stipulationwas that the enterprize should be kept secretfrom his mother for he knew the poor souladolph heyliger would not sleep a wink if she knew that her sonwas waging war with the powers of darknesswhen night came on

herbyan african conjuror as a charm against evilspirits dolph was escorted on his way by thedoctor and peter de groodt who had agreed toaccompany him to the house and to see him safelodgedthe night was overcast and it was very darkwhen they arrived at the grounds which surroundedthe mansion the sexton led the waywith a lanthorn as they walked along the avenueof acacias the fitful light catching frombush to bush and tree to tree often startled thedoughty peter and made him fall back upon hisfollowers and the doctor grappled still closerhold of dolph's arm observing that the groundwas very slippery and uneven at one time theywere nearly put to total rout by a bat whichc adolph heyligercame flitting about the lanthorn and the notesof the insects from the trees and the frogs froma

american country houses to servefor sitting rooms in warm weather from hencethey went up a wide staircase that groaned andcreaked as they trod every step making its particularnote like the key of a harpsichord thisled to another hall on the second story fromwhence they entered the room where dolph wasto sleep it was large and scantily furnishedthe shutters were closed but as they weremuch

whistledas they hurried down increasing their agitationand speed by its noises the front door slammedafter them and dolph heard them scramblingdown the avenue till the sound of their feetwas lost in the distance that he did not join inthis precipitate retreat might have been owingto his possessing a little more courage than his adolph heylgercompanions or perhaps that he had caught aglimpse of the cause of their dismay in a nestof chimney swallows that came tumbling downinto the fireplacebeing now left to himself he secured the frontdoor by a strong bolt and bar and having seenthat the other entrances were fastened he returnedto his desolate chamber having made hissupper from the basket which the good old cookhad provided he locked the chamber door andretired to rest on a mattress in one corner thenight was calm and still and nothing brokeupon the profound quiet but the lonely chirpingof a cricket from the chimney of a distant chamberthe rush light which stood in the centreof the deal table shed a feeble yellow ray dimlyillumining the chamber and making uncouthshapes and shadows on the walls from the clotheswhich dolph had thrown over a chairwith all his boldness of heart there was somethingsubduing in this desolate scene and hefelt his spirits flag within him as he lay on hishard bed and gazed about the room he wasadolph heyligeh turning over in his mind his idle habits hisdoubtful prospects and now and then heavinga heavy sigh as he thought on his poor old mother for there is nothing like the silence andloneliness of night to bring dark shadows overthe

allwas vacant yet still he heard these mysteriousfootsteps solemnly walking about the chamberthey ceased and all was dead silence therewas something more appalling in this invisiblevisitation than there would have been in anythingthat addressed itself to the eyesight itwas awfully vague and indefinite he felt hisheart beat hard against his ribs a cold sweatbroke out upon his forehead he lay for sometimein a state of violent agitation nothinghowever occurred to increase his alarm hislight gradually burnt down into the socket andhe felt asleep when he awoke it was broaddaylight the sun was peering through theadolph heyliqercracks of the window shutters and the birdswere merrily singing about the house thebright cheery day soon put to flight all the terrorsof the preceding night dolph laughed orrather tried to laugh at all that had passed andendeavoured to persuade himself that it was amere freak of the imagination conjured up bythe stories he had heard but he was a littlepuzzled to find the door of his room locked onthe inside notwithstanding that he had positivelyseen it swing open as the footsteps enteredhe returned to town in a state of considerableperplexity but he determined to say nothing onthe subject until his doubts were either confirmedor removed by another night's watchinghis silence was a grievous disappointment to thegossips who had gathered at the doctor's mansionthey had prepared their minds to heardireful tales and they were almost in a rage atbeing assured that he had nothing to relatethe next night then dolph repeated hisvigil he now entered the house with sometrepidation he was particular in examining adolph heyligekthe fastenings of all the doors and securingthem well he locked the door of his chamberand placed a chair upon it

as well as curiosity was piqued he endeavouredto calm the apprehensions of his motherand to assure her that there was no truthin all the rumours she had heard she lookedat him dubiously and shook her

same way motionless andfascinated staring at the figure which regardedhim as before with a dead fixed chillinggaze in this way they remained for a longtimetill by degrees dolph's courage began graduallyto revive whether alive or dead thisbeing had certainly some object in his visitationand he recollected to have heard it said thatspirits have no power to speak until they arespoken to summoning up resolution thereforeand making two or three attempts before hecould get his parched tongue in motion he addressedthe unknown in the most solemn formof adjuration that he could recollect and demandedto know what was the motive of hisvisitadolph heylifier no sooner had he finished than the old manrose and took down his hat the door opened andhe went out looking back upon dolph just ashecrossed the threshold as if expecting him tofollow the youngster did not hesitate an instanthe took the candle in his hand and thebible under his arm and obeyed the tacit invitationthe candle emitted a feeble uncertainray but still he could see the figure before himslowly descending the stairs he followed tremblingwhen it had reached the bottom of thestairs it turned through the hall towards the backdoor of the mansion dolph held the light overbalustrades but in his eagerness to catch a sightof the unknown he flared his feeble taper sosuddenly that it went out still there

when he got therethe unknown had disappeared the door remainedfast barred and bolted there was no adolph heyligerother mode of exit yet the being whatever hemight be was gone he unfastened the doorand looked out into the fields it was a hazymoonlight night so that the eye could distinguishobjects at some distance he thought hesaw the unknown in a footpath that led fromthe door he was not mistaken

the orchard of apple trees thatstood near the house always keeping to the footpathit led to a well situated in a little hollowwhich had supplied the farm with water justat this well dolph lost sight of him he rubbedhis eyes and looked again but nothing wasto be seen of the unknown he reached thewell but nobody was there all the surroundingground was open and clear there was nobush nor hiding

mysterious conductor hereturnedto the house full of awe and wonderhe bolted the door groped his way back tobed and it was long before he could composehimself to sleephis dreams were strange and

shore now amidst stormsand tempests and now wandering quietly in unknownstreets the figure of the unknown wasstrangely mingled up with the incidents of thedream and the whole distinctly wound up byhis finding himself on board of the vessel againreturning home with a great bag of money adolph heyligerwhen he woke the gray cool light of dawnwas streaking the horizon and the cocks passingthe rcveil from farm to farm throughout thecountry he rose more harassed and perplexedthan ever he was singularly confounded byall that he had seen and dreamt and began todoubt whether his mind was not affected andwhether all that was passing in his thoughtsmight not be mere feverish fantasy in his presentstate of mind he did not feel disposed toreturn immediately to the doctor's and undergothe crossquestioning of the household hemade a scanty breakfast therefore on the remainsof his last night's provisions and thenwandered out into the fields to meditate on allthat had befallen him lost in thought he rambledabout gradually approaching the town untilthe morning was far advanced when he wasroused by a hurry and bustle around him hefound himself near the water's edge in a throngof people hurrying to a pier where there was avessel ready to make sail he was unconsciouslycarried along by the impulse of the crowd andadolph heyliger found that it was a sloop on the point of sailingup the hudson to albany there was muchleavetaking and kissing of old women andchildren and great activity in carrying on boardbaskets of bread and cakes and provisions of allkinds notwithstanding the mighty joints ofmeat that dangled over the stern for a voyageto albany was an expedition of great momentin those days the commander of the sloopwas hurrying about and giving a world of orderswhich were not very strictly attended to one man being busy in lighting his pipe and anotherin sharpening his snickerseethe appearance of the commander suddenlycaught dolph's attention he was short and swarthywith cried black hair blind of one eyeand lame of one leg the very commander thathe had seen in his dream surprized and arousedhe considered the scene more attentively andrecalled still further traces of his dream theappearance of the vessel of the river and of aa variety of other objects accorded with the imperfectimages vaguely rising to recollection adolph heyligeras he stood musing on these circumstancesthe captain suddenly called to him in dutchstep on board young man or you'll be leftbehind he was startled by the summonshe saw that the sloop was cast loose and wasactually moving from the pier it seemed as if hewas actuated by some irresistible impulse hesprung upon the deck and the next moment thesloop was hurried off by the wind and tidedolph's thoughts and feelings were all in tumultand confusion he had been stronglyworked upon by the events that had recentlybefallen him and could not but think that therewas some connexion between his present situationand his last night's dream he felt as if hewas under supernatural influence and he triedto assure himself with an old and favourite maximof his that one way or other all would turnoutfor the best for a moment the indignationof the doctor at his departure without leavepassed across his mind but that was a matter oflittle moment then he thought of the distress ofhis mother at his strange disappearance and theadolph heyliger idea gave him a sudden pang he would haveintreated to he put on shore but he knew withsuch wind and tide the entreaty would have beenin vain then the inspiring love of novelty andadventure nine rushing in full tide through hisbosom he felt himself launched strangely andsuddenly on the world and under full way to explorethe regions of wonder that lay up this mightyriver and beyond those blue mountains that hadbounded his horizon since childhood while hewas lost in this whirl of thought the sails strainedto the freeze the shores seemed to hurry awaybehind him and before he perfectly recoveredhis selfpossession the sloop was ploughing herway past spiking devil and yonkers and thetallest chimney of the manhattoes had fadedfrom his sighti have said that a voyage up the

undertookit without putting his affairs in order makinghis will and having prayers said for him in thelow dutch churchesin the course of such a voyage thereforedolph was satisfied he would have time enoughto reflect and to make up his mind what heshould do when he arrived at albany the captainwith his blind eye and lame leg would it istrue bring his strange dream to mind and perplexhim sadly for a few moments but of late hislife had been made up so much of dreams aridrealities his nights and days had been so jumbledtogether that he seemed to be moving continuallyin a delusion there is always howevera kind of vagabond consolation in a man'sadolph heyliger having nothing in this world to lose with thisdolph comforted his heart and determinedto make the most of the present enjoymentin the second day of their voyage they cameto the highlands it was the latter part of acalm sultry day that they floated gently withthe tide between these stern mountains therewas that perfect quiet which prevails over naturein the languor of summer heat the turningof a plank or the accidental falling of anoar on deck was echoed from the mountain sideand reverberated along the shores and if bychance

heart turned faint within him and hehad well nigh let go his hold and tumbleddown the precipice the serpent stood on thedefensive but for an instant it was an instinctivemovement of defence and finding therewas no attack it glided away into a cleft of therock dolph's eye followed it with fearful intensityand he saw at a glance that he was inthe vicinity of a nest of adders that lay

perceived a light gleamingthrough the trees near the shore where thewinding of the river made a deep bay itcheered him with the hopes that here might be adolph heyligersome human habitation where he might getsomething to appease the clamorous cravings ofhis stomach and what was equally necessary inhis shipwrecked condition a comfortable shelterfor the night it was with extreme difficultythat he made his way towards the light alongledges of rocks down which he was in dangerof sliding into the river and over great trunksof fallen trees some of which had been blowndown in the late storm and lay so thickly togetherthat he had to struggle through theirbranches at length he came to the brow of arock that overhung a small dell from whencethe light proceeded it was from a fire at thefoot of a great tree that stood in the midst of agrassy interval or plat among the rocks thefire cast up a red glare among the gray crags andimpending trees leaving chasms of deep gloomthat looked like entrances to caverns a smallbrook rippled close by betrayed by the quiveringreflection of the frame there were twofigures moving about the fire and others squattedbefore it as they were between him

returned and the stragglerwas invited to join them at the fire adolph heyligeron approaching he found to his consolationthat the party was composed of white men aswell as indians one who was evidently theprincipal personage or commander was seatedon a trunk of a tree before the fire he was alarge stout man somewhat advanced in lifebut hale and hearty his face was bronzed almostto the colour of an

shortin his neck he wore a hunting frock withindian leggings and mockasons and a tomahawkin the broad wampum belt round his waistas dolph caught a distinct view of his personand features he was struck with something thatreminded him of the old man of the hauntedhouse the man before him however was differentin his dress and age he was more cheerytoo in his aspect and it was hard to define wherethe vague resemblance lay but a resemblancethere certainly was dolph felt some degree ofadolph heyliger awe in approaching him but was assured bythe frank hearty welcome with which he wasreceived as he cast his eyes about too hewas still farther encouraged by perceiving thatthe dead body which had caused him some alarmwas that of a deer and his satisfaction wascomplete in discovering by the savoury steamswhich issued from a kettle suspended by ahooked stick over the fire that there was a partcooking for the evening's repast he now foundthat he had fallen in with a rambling huntingparty such as often took place in those daysamong the settlers along the river the hunter isalways hospitable and nothing makes men moresocial and unceremonious than meeting in thewilderness the commander of the partypoured him out a dram of cheering liquor whichhe gave him with a merry leer to warm hisheart and ordered one of his followers to fetchsome garments from a pinnace which wasmoored in a cove close

of albany ofwhom dolph had many a time heard he wasadolph heyliger in fact the hero of many a story being a man ofsingular humours and whimsical habits thatwere matters of wonder to his quiet dutch neighboursas he was a man of property havinghad a father before him from whom he inheritedlarge tracts of wild land and whole barrels fullof wampum he could indulge his humourswithout control instead of staying quietly athome eating and drinking at regular meal timesamusing himself by smoking his pipe on thebench before the door and then turning into acomfortable bed at night he delighted in allkinds of rough wild expeditions he wasnever so happy as when on a hunting party inthe wilderness sleeping under trees or barksheds or cruising down the river or on somewoodland lake fishing and fowling and livingthe lord knows howhe was a great friend to indians and to anindian mode of life which he considered truenatural liberty and manly enjoyment when athome he had always several indian

entered a househe would slap the good man familiarly on hisback shake him by the hand till he roared andkiss his wife and daughters before his face inshort there was no pride nor ill humour aboutheer

occasionally on his expeditions itwas with a medley of such retainers that he wasadolph heyliger at present on a cruize along the shores of thehudson in a pinnace which he kept for his ownrecreation there were two white men withhim dressed partly in the indian style withmockasons and hunting shirts the rest of hiscrew consisted of four favourite indians theyhad been prowling about the river

never had dolph madea more delicious repast and when he had washedit down by two or three draughts from theheer antony's flask and felt the jolly liquor sendingits warmth through his veins and glowinground his heart he would not have changed hissituation no not with the governor of theprovincethe heer antony too grew chirping andjoyous he told half a dozen fat stories at whichhis white

made their supper in silence from the contentsof the kettle and having drank their allowanceand smoked their pipes they wrappedthemselves in their blankets stretched themselveson the ground with their feet to the fire andsoon fell asleep the others remained chatting adolph heyligerbefore the fire which the gloom of the forest andthe dampness of the air from the late storm renderedextremely comfortable and cheeringthe conversation gradually moderated fromthe hilarity of supper time and turned uponhunting adventures and exploits and perils in thewilderness many of which were so strange andimprobable that i will not venture to repeatthem lest the veracity of heer antony and hiscomrades be brought into question there weremany legendary tales told also about the riverand the settlements on its borders and as heerantony sat in a twisted root of a fallen tree thatserved him for a kind of arm chair and told thesewild stories with the fire gleaming on his stronglymarked face dolph was again repeatedlystruck with something in his looks that remindedhim of the nightly visiter to the haunted housethe circumstance of dolph's falling overboardled to the relation of anecdotes of mishaps thathad befallen voyagers on this great river manyof which were attributed to supernatural causeson dolph's staring at this suggestion antonyadolph heyliger vander heyden assured him that it was verycurrently believed among the settlers along theriver that these highlands were under the dominionof supernatural and mischievous beings which seemed particularly to vent their spleenupon the dutch skippers some he said believedthem to be the evil spirits conjured up bythe indian wizards in the early times of theprovince to revenge themselves on the strangerswho had dispossessed them of their country thegreater part however accounted for them bythe legend of the storm ship which hauntedpointnopoint finding dolph to be utterlyignorant of this tradition heer antony undertookto tell it in the very words in which it hadbeen written out by mynheer selon an earlypoet of the newnetherlands giving thereforea stir to the fire he adjusted himself comfortablyin his root of a tree and throwing back hishead and closing his eyes for a few moments tosummon up his recollection he related the follow t ing legend adolph heyligerthe storm shipin the golden age of the province of thenew

breaking fromunder the fringed borders of the clouds madethe broad bosom of the bay to gleam like a seaof molten goldthe word was given from the fort that a shipwas standing up the bay it passed from mouthto mouth and street to street and soon put thelittle capital in a bustle the arrival of a shipin those early times of the settlement was anevent of vast importance to the inhabitants itbrought

adolph heyligerof the bay and that she broke suddenly uponhis sight just as if she had come out of the bosomof the black thunder cloud the bystanderslooked at hans van pelt to see what hewould say to this report hans van pelt screwedhis mouth closer together and said nothing upon which some shook their heads and othersshrugged their shouldersthe ship was now repeatedly hailed but madeno reply and passing by the fort stood on up thehudson a gun was brought to bear on herand with some difficulty loaded and fired byhans van pelt the garrison not being expert inartillery the shot seemed absolutely to passthrough the ship and to skip along the wateron the other side but no notice was taken of itwhat was strange she had all her sails set andsailed right against wind and tide which wereboth down the riverupon this hans van pelt who was likewiseharbour master ordered his boat and set off toboard her but after rowing for two or three hourshe returned without success sometimes headolph heyliger would get within one or two hundred yards ofher and then in a twinkling she would be halfa mile off some said it w r as because his oarsmenwho were rather pursy and short windedstopped every now and then to take breath andspit on their hands but this it is probable was amere scandal h e got near enough however tosee the crew who were all dressed in the dutchstyle the officers in doublets and high hats andfeathers not a word was spoken by any oneon board they stood as motionless as so manystatues and the ship seemed as ifleft to her owngovernment thus she kept on away up theriver lessening and lessening in the evening sunshineuntil she faded from sight like a littlewhite cloud melting away in a summer skythe appearance of this ship threw the governorinto one of the deepest doubts that ever besethim in the whole course of his administrationfears were entertained for the security of theinfant settlements on the river lest this mightbe an enemy's ship in disguise sent to takepossession the governor called together hiscounsel repeatedly to assist him with their conadolphheyligerlectures he sat in his chair of state built oftimber from the sacred forest of the hague andsmoked his long jasmin pipe and listened toall that his counsellors had to say on a subjectabout which they knew nothing but in spite ofall the conjecturing of the sagest and oldest headsthe governor still continued to doubtmessengers were despatched to different placeson the river but they returned without anytidings the ship had made no port day afterdny and week after week elapsed but she neverreturned down the hudson as however thecouncil seemed solicitous for intelligence theysoon had it in abundance the captains of thesloops seldom arrived without bringing some reportof having seen the strange ship at differentparts of the river sometimes near the pallisadoes sometimes off croton point and sometimesin the highlands but she was never reportedas having been seen above the highlandsthe crews of the sloops it is true generally differedamong themselves in their accounts ofthese apparitions but that may have arisenadolph heyliger from the uncertain situations in which they sawher sometimes it was by the flashes of a thunderstorm lighting up a pitchy night and givingglimpses of her careering across tappaan zee orthe wide waste of haverstraw bay at onemoment she would appear close upon them as iflikely to run them down and would throwthem into great bustle and alarm when the nextflash would show her far off always sailingagainst the wind sometimes in quiet moonlightnights she would be seen under some highbluff of the highlands all in deep shadow exceptingher topsails glittering in the moonbeamsby the time however that the voyagerswould reach the place there would be no shipto be seen and when they had passed on forsome distance and looked back behold thereshe was again with her topsails in the moonshine her appearance was always just afteror just before or just in the midst of unrulyweather and she was known by all the skippersand voyagers of the hudson by the name of thestorm ship adolph heyligeuthese reports perplexed the governor and hiscouncil more than ever and it would be endlessto repeat the conjectures and opinions thatwere uttered on the subject some quotedcases in point of ships seen off the coast ofnewengland navigated by witches and goblinsold hans van pelt who had been morethan once to the dutch colony at the cape ofgood hope insisted that this must be the flyingdutchman which had so long haunted tablebay but being unable to make port hadnow sought another harbour others suggestedthat if it really was a supernatural apparitionas there was every natural reason to believeit might be hendrick hudson and his crew ofthe half moon who it was well known hadonce run aground in the upper part of the riverin seeking a northwest passage to china thisopinion had very little weight with the governor but it passed current out of doors indeed ithad already been reported that hendrick hudsonand his crew haunted the kaatskill mountain and it appeared very reasonable to heyliger pose that his ship might infest the river wherethe enterprise was baffled or that it might bearthe shadowy crew to their periodical revels inthe mountainother events occurred to occupy the thoughtsand doubts of the sage outer and his council and the storm ship ceased to be a subject ofdeliberation at the board it continued howeverto be a matter of popular belief and marvellousanecdote throughout the whole time ofthe dutch goverment and particularly just beforethe capture of newamsterdam and thesubjugation of the province by the englishsquadron about that time the storm shipwas repeatedly seen in the tappaan zee aboutweehawk and even down as far as hobokenand her appearance was supposed to be ominousof the approaching squall in public affairsand the downfall of dutch dominationsince that time we have no authentic accountsof her though it is said she still hauntsthe highlands and cruises about pointnopointpeople who live along the river insist that theyvol n adolph heyligersometimes see her in summer moonlight andthat in a deep still midnight they have heardthe chant of her crew as if heaving the lead but sights and sounds are so deceptive alongthe mountainous shores and about the widebays and long reaches of this great river thati confess i have very strong doubts upon thesubjectit is certain nevertheless that strange thingshave been seen in these highlands in stormswhich are considered as connected with the oldstory of the ship the captains of the rivercraft talk of a little bulbousbottomed dutchgoblin in trunk hose and su garloaf d hat witha speaking trumpet in his hand which they saykeeps about the dunderberg mountain theydeclare that they have heard him in stormyweather in the midst of the turmoil giving ordersin low dutch for the piping up of a fresh gust ofwind or the rattling off of another thunder clapthat sometimes he has been seen surrounded bya crew of little imps in broad breeches and shortdoublets tumbling head over heels in the rackadolph meyligerand mist and playing a thousand gambols inthe air or buzzing like a swarm of flies aboutantony's nose and that at such time thehurryscurry of the storm was always greatestone time a sloop in passing by dunderbergwas overtaken by a thunderous that camescouring down from the mountain and seemedto burst just over the vessel though tight andwell ballasted yet she laboured dreadfully androcked until the water came over the gunwaleall the crew were amazed when it was discoveredthat there was a little white sugarloaf hat onthe mast head w which was known at once forthe hat of the heer of the dunderberg nobodyhowever dared to climb to the mast headand get rid of this terrible hat the sloop continuedlabouring and rocking as if she wouldhave rolled her mast overboard she seemedin continual danger either of upsetting or of runningon shore in this way she drove quitethrough the highlands until she had passedpollopeps island where it is said the jurisdictionof the dunderberg potentate ceases no adolph heyligersooner had she passed this bourne than the littlehat all at once spun up into the air like a top whirled up all the clouds into a vortex andhurried them back to the summit of the under while the sloop righted herself and sailedon as quietly as if in a millpond nothingsaved her from utter wreck but the fortunatecircumstance of having a horse shoe nailedagainst the mast a wise precaution against evilspirits which has since been adopted by all thedutch captains that navigate this haunted riverthere is another story told of this foul weatherurchin by skipper daniel ouslesticker offishkill who was never known to tell a liehe declared that in a severe squall he saw himseated astride of his bowsprit riding the sloopashore full butt against antony's noseand that he was exorcised by dominie vangibson of esopus who happened to be onboardand who sung the hymn of st nicholas whereupon the goblin threw himself up in theair like a ball and went off in a whirlwindcarrying away with him the nightcap of theadolph heyliger dominie's wife which was discovered the nextsunday morning hanging on the weathercockof esopus church steeple at least forty milesoff after several events of this kind had takenplace the regular skippers of the river for along time did not venture to pass the underwithout lowering their peak out of homageto the heer of the mountain and it wasobserved that all such as paid this tribute of respectwere suffered to pass unmolestedsuch said antony vander heyden areafew of the stories written down by selon thepoet concerning this storm ship which he affirmsto have brought this colony of mischievousimps into the province from some old ghostridden country of europe i could give you ahost more if necessary for all the accidentsthat so often befall the river craft in the highlandsare said to be tricks played off by these adolph heyligerimps of the dunderberg but i see that you arenodding so let us turn in for the nightthe moon had now just raised her silverhorns above the round back of old bull hill and lit up the gray rocks and shagged forests and glittered on the waving bosom of the riverthe night dew was falling and the late gloomymountains began to soften and put on a grayaerial tint in the dewy light the hunters stirredthe fire and threw on fresh fuel to qualifythe damp of the night air they then prepareda bed of branches and dry leaves under aledge of rocks for dolph while antony wanderheyden wrapping himself up in a huge coatmade of skins stretched himself before the fireit was some time however before dolphcould close his eyes he lay contemplating thestrange scene before him the wild w r gods androcks around the fire throwing fitful gleams onthe faces of the sleeping savages and the heerantony too who so singularly yet vaguely remindedhim of the nightly visitant to the hauntedhouse now and then he heard the cry ofadolph heyliger some animal from the forest or the hooting ofthe owl or the notes of the whippoorwill whichseemed to abound among these solitudes or thesplash of a sturgeon leaping out of the riverand falling back full length on its placid surfacehe contrasted all this with his accustomed nestin the garret room of the doctor's mansion where the only sounds he heard at night werethe church clock telling the hour the drowsyvoice of the watchman drawling out that all waswell the deep snoring of the doctor's clubbednose from below stairs or the cautious laboursof some carpenter rat gnawing in the wainscothis thoughts then wandered to his poor oldmother what would she think of his mysteriousdisappearance what anxiety and distresswould she not suffer this was the thought thatwould continually intrude itself to mar his presentenjoyment it brought with it a feeling ofpain and compunction and he fell asleep withthe tears yet standing in his eyeswere this a mere tale of fancy here wouldbe a fine opportunity for weaving in strange adolph heyligerventures among these wild mountains and rovinghunters and after involving my hero inavariety of perils and unheardof difficultiesrescuing him from them all by some miraculouscontrivance but as this is absolutely a truestory i must content myself with simple factsand keep to probabilitiesat an early hour of the next day therefore aftera hearty morning's meal the encampmentbroke up and our adventurers embarked in thepinnace of antony vander heyden there beingno wind for the sails the indians rowed hergently along keeping time to a kind of chantof one of the white men the day was sereneand beautiful the river without a wave andas the vessel cleft the glassy water it left a longundulating track behind the crows who hadscented the hunters banquet were alreadygathering and hovering in the air just where acolumn of thin blue smoke rising from amongthe trees showed the place of their last night'squarters as they coasted along the bases ofthe mountains the heer antony pointed out toadolph heyliger dolph a bald eagle the sovereign of these regionswho sat perched on a dry tree that projectedover the river and with eye turned upwardsseemed to be drinking in the splendourof the morning sun their approach disturbedthe monarch's meditations he first spread onewing and then the other balanced himself foramoment and then quitting his perch withdignified composure wheeled slowly over theirheads dolph snatched up a gun and sent awhistling ball after him that cut some of thefeathers from his wing the report of the gunleaped sharply from rock to rock and awakeneda thousand echoes but the monarch of theair sailed calmly on ascending higher and higherand wheeling widely as he ascended soaringup the green bosom of the woody mountainuntil he disappeared over the brow of a beetlingprecipice dolph felt in a manner rebuked bythis proud tranquillity and almost reproachedhimself for having so wantonly insulted thismajestic bird heer antony told him laughingto remember that he was not yet out of the tervoln adolph heyligelthistories of the lord of the dunderberg and an oldindian shook his head and observed that therewas bad luck in killing an eagle the hunter onthe contrary should always leave horn a portionof his spoilsnothing however occurred to molest themon their voyage they passed pleasantly throughthese magnificent and lonely scenes until theycame to where pollopel's island lies like a floatingbower at the extremity of the highlandshere they landed until the heat of the day shouldabate or a breeze spring up that might supersedethe labour of the oar some prepared the middaymeal while others reposed under the shadeof the trees in luxurious summer indolence looking drowsily forth upon the beauty of thescene on the one side were the highlandsvast and cragged feathered to the top with forestsand throwing their shadows on the glassywater that dimpled at their feet on the otherside was a wide expanse of the river like abroad lake with long sunny reaches and greenheadlands and the distant line of shawungunkadolph heyliger mountains waving along a clear horizon or chequeredby a fleecy cloudbut i forbear to dwell on the particulars oftheir cruize along the river this vagrant amphibiouslife careering across silver sheets ofwater coasting wild woodland shores banquettingon shady promontories with the spreadingtree overhead the river curling its light foamto one's feet and distant mountain and rock andtree and snowy cloud and deep blue sky allmingling in summer beauty before one all thisthough never cloying in the enjoyment wouldbe but tedious in narrationwhen encamped by the water side some ofthe party would go into the woods and hunt others would fish sometimes they would amusethemselves by shooting at a mark by leaping byrunning by wrestling and dolph gained greatfavour in the eyes of antony vander hey denby his skill and adroitness in all these exerciseswhich the heer considered as the highest ofmanly accomplishments adolph heyligekthus did they coast jollily on choosing onlythe pleasant hours for voyaging sometimes inthe cool morning dawn sometimes in the soberevening twilight and sometimes when themoonshine spangled the crisp curling wavesthat whispered along the sides of their little barknever had dolph felt so completely in his element never had he met with any thing so completelyto his taste as this wild haphazard lifehe was the very man to second antony vanderheyden in his rambling humours and gainedcontinually on his affections the heart of theold bushwhacker yearned towards the youngman who seemed thus growing up in his ownlikeness and as they approached the end of theirvoyage he could not help inquiring a little intohis history dolph frankly told him his courseof life his severe medical studies his little proficiencyand his very dubious prospects theheer vas shocked to find that such amazingtalents and accomplishments were to be crampedand buried under a doctor's wig he had a sovereigncontempt for the healing art having neveradolph heyliger had any other physician than the butcher hebore a mortal grudge to all kinds of study alsoever since he had been flogged about an unintelligiblebook when he was a boy but to thinkthat a young fellow like dolph of such wonderfulabilities who could shoot fish run jumpride and wrestle should be obliged to roll pillsand administer juleps for a living twas monstrous he told dolph never to despair but tothrow physic to the dogs for a young fellowof his prodigious talents could never fail to makehis way as you seem to have no acquaintancein albany said heer antony you shall gohome with me and remain under my roof untilyou can look about you and in the mean time ywe can take an occasional bout at shooting andfishing for it is a pity such talents should beidledolph who was at the mercy of chance wasnot hard to be persuaded indeed on turningover matters in his mind which he did very sagelyand deliberately he could not but think that antonyvander heyden was somehow or other adolph heyligekconnected with the story of the haunted house that the misadventure in the highlands whichhad thrown them so strangely together wassomehow or other to work out somethinggood in short there is nothing so convenient asthis somehow or other way of accommodatingone's self to circumstances it is the mainstayof a heedless actor and tardy reasoner likedolph heyliger and he who can in this looseeasy way link foregone evil to anticipated goodpossesses a secret of happiness almost equal tothe philosopher's stoneon their arrival at albany the sight of dolph'scompanion seemed to cause universal satisfactionmany were the greetings at the river sideand the salutations in the streets the dogsbounded before him the boys whooped as hepassed every body seemed to know antonyvander heyden dolph followed on in silenceadmiring the neatness of this worthy burgh forin those days albany was in all its glory inhabitedalmost exclusively by the descendants ofthe original dutch settlers it had not as yetadolph heyliger been discovered and colonized by the restlesspeople of newengland every thing was quietand orderly every thing was conducted calmlyand leisurely no hurry no bustle no strugglingand scrambling for existence the grassgrew about the unpaved streets and relieved theeye by its refreshing verdure tall sycamoresor pendent willows shaded the houses with caterpillarsswinging in long silken strings fromtheir branches or moths fluttering about likecoxcombs in joy at their gay transformationthe houses were built in the old dutch stylewith the gable ends towards the street thethrifty housewife was seated on a bench beforeher door in a close crimped cap bright floweredgown and white apron busily employed in knittingthe husband smoked his pipe on the oppositebench and the little pet negro girl seatedon the step at her mistress feet was industriouslyplying her needle the swallows sportedabout the eaves or skimmed along the streetsand brought back some rich booty for their clamorousyoung and the little housekeeping wren adolph heyligerflew in and out of a lilliputian house or an oldhat nailed against the wall the cows werecoming home lowing through the streets to bemilked at their owners doors and if perchancethere were any loiterers some negro urchin witha long goad was gently urging them homewardsas dolph's companion passed on he receiveda tranquil nod from the burghers and a friendlyword from their wives all calling him familiarlyby the name of anton j for it was the customin this strong hold of the patriarchs where theyhad all grown up together from childhood tocall every one by the christian name theheer did not pause to have his usual jokes withthem for he was impatient to reach his homeat length they arrived at his mansion it wasof some magnitude in the dutch style withlarge iron figures on the gables that gave thedate of its erection and showed that it had beenbuilt in the earliest times of the settlementthe news of heer antony's arrival had precededhim and the whole household was onthe look out a crew of negroes large anddolfh heyliger small had collected in front of the house to receivehim the old whiteheaded ones whohad grown gray in his service grinned for joyand made many awkward bows and grimaces and the little ones capered about his knees butthe most happy being in the household was alittle plump blooming lass his only child andthe darling of his heart she came boundingout of the house but the sight of a strangeyoung man with her father called up for a momentall the bashfulness of a homebred damseldolph gazed at her with wonder and delightnever had he seen as he thought any thing socomely in the shape of woman she was dressedin the good old dutch taste with long staysand full short petticoats so admirably adapted toshow and set off the female form her hairturned up under a small round cap displayedthe fairness of her forehead she had fine bluelaughing eyes a trim slender waist and softswell but in a word she was a little dutchdivinity and dolph who never stopped halfvol ii adolph heyligerway in a new impulse fell desperately in lovewith herdolph was now ushered into the house witha hearty welcome in the interior was a mingleddisplay of heer antony's taste and habits andthe opulence of his predecessors the chamberswere furnished with good old carved mahoganythe beaufets and cupboards glittered with embossedsilver and painted china over the parlourfireplace was as usual the family coat ofarms painted and framed above which was along duck fowling piece flanked by an indianpouch and a powderhorn the room was decoratedwith many indian articles such as pipesof peace tomahawks scalping knives huntingpouches and belts of wampum and there werevarious kinds of fishing tackle and two or threefowling pieces in the corners the householdaffairs seemed to be conducted in some measureafter the master's humours corrected perhapsby a little quiet management of the daughter'sthere was a great degree of patriarchal simplicityand good humoured indulgence the neadolphheyliger goes came into the room without being calledmerely to look at their master and hear of hisadventures they would stand listening at thedoor until he had finished a story and then gooff on a broad grin to repeat it in the kitchena couple of pet negro children were playingabout the floor with the dogs and sharing withthem their bread and butter all the domesticslooked hearty and happy and when the tablewas set for the evening repast the variety andabundance of good household luxuries bore testimonyto the open handed liberality of the heerand the notable housewifery of his daughterin the evening there dropped in several of theworthies of the place the van rensselaerand the gansevoorts and the rosebooms andothers of antony vander heyden's intimatesto hear an account of his expedition for he wasthe sindbad of albany and his exploits and adventureswere favourite topics of conversationamong the inhabitants while these sat gossipingtogether about the door of the hall andtelling long twilight stories dolph was cosily adolph heyligerseated entertaining the daughter on a windowbench he had already got on intimate termsfor those were not times of false reserve andidle ceremony and besides there is somethingwonderfully propitious to a lover's suit in thdelightful dusk of a long summer evening itgives courage to the most timid tongue andhides the blushes of the bashful the starsalone twinkled brightly and now and then afirefly streamed his transient light before thewindow or wandering into the room flewgleaming about the ceilingwhat dolph whispered in her ear that longsummer evening it is impossible to say hiswords were so low and indistinct that they havenever reached the ear of the historian it isprobable however that they were to the purposefor he had a natural talent at pleasing thesex and was never long in company with a petticoatwithout paying proper court to it inthe mean time the visitors one by one departedantony vander heyden who had fairly talkedhimself silent sat nodding alone in his chair byadolph heyliger the door when he was suddenly aroused by thehearty salute with which dolph heyliger hadunguardedly rounded off one of his periods andwhich echoed through the still chamber like thereport of a pistol the heer started up rubbedhis eyes called for lights and observed that itwas high time to go to bed on parting for thenight he squeezed dolph heartily by the hand looked waggishly in his face shook his headknowingly ah dolph dolph said hechuckling i see you're a sly dogjust like iwas at your age the chamber in which our hero was lodgedwas spacious and panelled with oak it wasfurnished with clothes presses and mighty chestsof drawers well waxed and glittering with brassornaments these contained ample stock offamily linen for the dutch housewives had alwaysa laudable pride in showing off their householdtreasures to strangersdolph's mind however was too full to takeparticular note of the objects around him yethe could not help continually comparing the free adolph heyligekopenhearted cheeriness of this establishmentwith the starveling sordid joyless housekeepingat doctor knypperhausen's still there wassomething that marred the enjoyment the ideathat he must take leave of his hearty host andpretty hostess and cast himself once more adriftupon the world to linger here would be follyhe should only get deeper in love and for apoor varlet like himself to aspire to the daughterof the great heer vander heyden it wasmadness to think of such a thing the verykindness that the girl had shown towards himprompted him on reflection to hasten his departure it would be a poor return for the frankhospitality of his host to entangle his daughter'sheart in an injudicious attachment in a worddolph was like many other young reasoners ofexceeding good hearts and giddy heads whothink after they act and act differently from whatthey think who make excellent determinationsover night and forget to keep them the nextmorningadolph heyliger this is a fine conclusion truly of my

reached out his handto extinguish the candle when he was suddenlystruck with astonishment and dismay for hethought he beheld the spectre of the hauntedhouse staring at him from a dusky part of thechamber a second look reassured him as heperceived that what he had taken for the spectrewas in fact nothing but a flemish portrait thathung in a shadowy corner just behind a clothes adolph heyligerpress it was however the precise representationof his nightly visiter the same cloak andbelted jerkin the same grizzled beard and fixedeye the same broad slouched hat with a featherhanging over one side dolph now called tomind the resemblance he had frequently remarkedbetween his host and the old man of the hauntedhouse and was fully convinced that they werein some way connected and that some especialdestiny had governed his voyage he lay gazingon the portrait with almost as much awe as hehad gazed on the ghostly original until theshrill house clock warned him of the lateness ofthe hour he put out the light but remainedfor a long time turning over these curious circumstancesand coincidences in his mind untilhe fell asleep his dreams partook of the natureof his waking thoughts he fancied that hestill lay gazing on the picture until by degreesit became animated that the figure descendedfrom the wall and walked out of the roomthat he followed it and found himself by thewell to which the old man pointed smiled onhim and disappearedrolph heyliger in the morning when dolph waked he foundhis host standing by his bed side who gave hima hearty morning's salutation and asked him howhe had slept dolph answered cheerily and tookthe occasion to inquire about the portrait thathung against the wall ah said heer antony that's a portrait of old killian vanderspiegel once a burgomaster of amsterdam who onsome popular troubles abandoned holland andcame over to the province during the governmentof peter stuyvesant he was my ancestorby the mother's side and an old miserly curmudgeonhe was when the english tookpossession of new amsterdam in he retiredinto the country he fell into a melancholyapprehending that his wealth would betakenfrom him and that he would come tobeggary he turned all his property into cashand used to hide it away he was for a yearor two concealed in various places fancyinghimself sought after by the english to strip himof his wealth and finally was found dead inhis bed one morning without any one beingvol h adolph heylgekable to discover where he had concealed thegreater part of his moneywhen his host had left the room dolph remainedfor some time lost in thought hiswhole mind was occupied by what he hadheard vanderspiegel was his mother's familyname and he recollected to have heard herspeak of this very killian vanderspiegel as oneof her ancestors he had heard her say toothat her father was killian's rightful heir onlythat the old man died without leaving any thingto be inherited it now appeared that heerantony was likewise a descendant and perhapsan heir also of this poor old rich man and that thus the heyligers and the vanderhey dens were remotely connected whatthought he if after all this is the interpretationof my dream j that this is the way i am tomake my fortune by this voyage to albanyand that i am to find the old man's hiddenwealth in the bottom of that well butwhat an odd roundabout mode of communicatingthe matter why the vengeance could notadolph heyliger the old goblin have told me about the well atonce without sending me all the way to albanyto hear a story that was to send me allthe way back again these thoughts passed through his mind ashewas dressing he descended the stairs fullof perplexity when the bright face of marievander heyden suddenly beamed in smilesupon him and seemed to give him a clue to thewhole mystery after all thought he theold goblin is in the right if am to get hiswealth he means that i shall marry his prettydescendant thus both branches of the familywill be again united and the property go on inthe proper channelno sooner did this idea enter his head than itcarried conviction with it he was now all impatienceto hurry back and secure the treasure which he did not doubt lay at the bottom ofthe well and which he feared every momentmight be discovered by some other personwho knows thought he but this nightwalkingold fellow of the haunted house may adolph heyligerbe in the habit of haunting every visiter and maygive a hint to some shrewder fellow than myselfwho will take a shorter cut to the well than bythe way of albany he wished a thousandtimes that the babbling old ghost was laid in thered sea and his rambling portrait with himhe was in a perfect fever to depart two orthree days elapsed before any opportunity presentedfor returning down the river they wereages to dolph notwithstanding that he wasbasking in the smiles of the pretty marie anddaily getting more and more enamoured atlength the very sloop from

excursions into the wilderness and hisindians were actually preparing for a grand expeditionto one of the lakes he took dolphaside and exerted his eloquence to get him togive up all thoughts of business and to remainwith him but in vain and he at length gaveadolph heyliger up the attempt observing that it was a thousandpities so fine a young man should throwhimself away heer antony however gavehim a hearty shake by the hand at parting witha favourite fowling piece and an invitation tocome to his house whenever he revisited albanythe pretty little marie said nothing but as hegave her a

continually goaded by theidea of the uneasiness she must experience onhis account on his way thither he endeavouredto arrange some mode of accounting for hisabsence but felt sadly at a loss for with all hisheedlessness he was naturally frank and sincereand had never deceived her he had connedover something that he thought would do whenon entering the street in which her house wassituated he was thunderstruck on beholding itaheap of ruins there had been a great firewhich had destroyed several large houses andthe humble dwelling of poor dame heyliger hadbeen involved in the conflagration the

doubts and conversations between ladylilly craft master simon and the parson on thesubject of marrying in the month of may against which i find there is an ancient prejudiceas being an unfortunate month for matrimonyfrom the discussions that took placeon these occasions i picked up much valuableinformation relative to weddings such as thatif there were two celebrated in the same churchtol n the weddingon the same day the first would be happy thesecond otherwise if in going to church theyshould meet the funeral of a female the bridewould die first if of a male the bridegroomif the new married couple were to dance togetheron their wedding day the wife wouldthenceforth rule the roast with many more curiousfacts of the same kind which made meponder more than ever upon the perils whichsurround this happy state and how little menknow the awful risks they run in venturing uponit i abstain however from enlarging on thistopic as i have no wish to promote the increaseof bachelorsthe squire however though he gave dueweight to all these ancient saws yet had a hostof poetical authorities in favour of this lovingmonth which i suppose were conclusive withthe young couple as i found they were perfectlywilling to marry in may and abide the consequencesthe wedding has accordingly taken place atthe village church in presence of a numerousthe wedding company of relations and friends and many ofthe tenantry the squire must needs havesomething of the old ceremonies observed on theoccasion so at the gate of the churchyardseveral little girls of the village dressed in whitewere in readiness with baskets of flowers whichthey strewed before the bride and the butlerbore before her the bride cup a great embossedsilver bowl one of the family reliques from thedays of the hard drinkers this was filled withrich wine and decorated with a branch of rosemarytied with gay ribbands according to ancientcustomhappy is the bride that the sun shines onsays the old proverb and it was as sunny andauspicious a morning as heart could wish thebride looked uncommonly beautiful but infact what woman does not look interesting on herwedding day there is something extremelytouching in the appearance of a young and timidbride in her robes of virgin white led up tremblingto the altar when thus i behold a lovelygirl in the tenderness of her years forsaking her the weddingfather's house and the home of her childhoodand giving herself up with implicit confiding tothe man of her choice in the good old languageof the ceremony for better for worse forricher for poorer in sickness and in health tolove honour and obey till death us do partit brings to my mind the beautiful self devotionof ruth whither thou goes i will go andwhere thou longest i will lodge thy people shallbe my people and thy god my godthe fair julia was supported on the tryingoccasion by lady lillycraft whose heart wasoverflowing with its wonted sympathy in allmatters of love and matrimony as the brideapproached the altar her face would be one momentcovered with blushes and the next deadlypale and she seemed almost ready to shrink fromsight among her female companions i do notknow what it is that makes every one seriousand as it were awe struck at a marriage ceremony which is generally considered as an occasionof festivity and rejoicing as the ceremonywas performing i observed many a rosythe wedding face among the country girls turn pale and idid not see a smile throughout the church theyoung ladies from the hall were almost as muchfrightened as if it had been their own case andstole many a look of sympathy at their tremblingcompanion a tear stood in the eye of the sensitivelady lillycraft and as to phoebe wilkinswho was present the soft hearted baggage absolutelywept and sobbed aloud but it is hard totell half the time what these fond foolish creaturesare crying aboutthe captain too though naturally gay andunconcerned was much agitated on the occasionand in attempting to put the ring upon thebride's finger dropped it on the floor which i amsince told is a very lucky omen even mastersimon had lost his usual vivacity and had assumeda most whimsically solemn face whichhe is apt to do on all occasions of ceremonyhe had much whispering with the parson andparish clerk for he is always a busy personagein the scene and he echoed the clerk's amenwith a solemnity and devotion that edified thewhole assemblage the weddingthe moment however that the ceremonywas over the transition was magical thebride cup was passed round according to ancientusage for the company to drink to ahappy union every one's feelings seemed tobreak forth from restraint master simon had aworld of bachelor pleasantries to utter andas to the gallant general he bowed and cooedabout the dulcet lady lillycraft like a mightycock pigeon about his damethe villagers gathered in the churchyard tocheer the happy couple as they left the churchand the musical tailor had marshalled his bandand set up a hideous discord as the blushingand smiling bride passed through a lane of honestpeasantry to her carriage the childrenshouted and threw up their hats the bells ranga merry peal that threatened to bring down thebattlements of the old tower and set all thecrows and rooks flying and cawing about theair and there was a continual popping off ofrusty firelock from every part of the neighbourhoodthe wedding the prodigal son distinguished himself onthe occasion but had nearly done mischief asthe horses of the bride's carriage took frightfrom the discharge of a row of old gun barrelswhich he had mounted as a park of artillery infront of the school house to give the captain amilitary salute as he passedthe day passed off with great rustic rejoinkings tables were spread under the trees inthe park where all the peasantry of the neighbourhoodwere regaled with roast beef andplum pudding and oceans of ale ready moneyjack presided at one of the tables and becameso full of good cheer as to unbend fromhis

have seen severalflirtations among the young people that havebeen brought together on this occasion mastersimon however has told me in great confidencethat he thinks the old general's case isdesperate with lady lillycraft she having determinedthat he is quite destitute of sentimentit is with some concern therefore that i haveseen him throwing away tender glances uponher at the w r adding dinner during the changingof the dishesi am told moreover that young jack tibiii the weddingbets was so touched by the wedding ceremonyat which he was present and captivated by thesensibility of poor phoebe wilkins that he hada reconciliation with her that very day after dinnerin one of the groves of the park and dancedwith her at the village in the evening to thecomplete confusion of old dame

loversundertook the critical task of breaking the matterto ready money jack she thought therewas no time like the present and attacked thesturdy old yeoman that very evening in the parkwhile his heart was yet lifted up with the squire'sgood cheer jack was a little surprised at beingdrawn aside by her ladyship but was not to beflurried by such anhonour he was still moresurprised by the nature of her communication and this first intelligence of an affair that hadbeen passing under his eye he listened howthewedding ever with his usual gravity as her ladyship representedthe advantages of the match

in the narrative had gone wrongand hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiteratingthe soft hearted phoebe's merit andfidelity and her great unhappiness when oldready money suddenly interrupted her byexclaiming that if jack did not marry thewench he'd break every bone in his body the match therefore is considered a settledthing dame tibbets and the housekeeper havemade friends and drank tea together and phoebehas again recovered her good looks and goodspirits and is caroling from morning till nightlike a larkbut the most whimsical caprice of cupid isone that i should be almost afraid to

preparations for her departure anaudience was requested by her immaculate handmaidmrs hannah who with much primmingof the mouth and many maidenly hesitationsrequested leave to stay behind and that

interference she did not know what she should do withoutmrs hannah she had been used to have herabout her so long a timethe squire on the contrary rejoiced in thematch as relieving the good lady from a kind oftoilette tyrant under whose sway she had sufferedfor years instead of thwarting the affairtherefore he has given it his full countenanceand declares that he will set up the youngcouple in one
