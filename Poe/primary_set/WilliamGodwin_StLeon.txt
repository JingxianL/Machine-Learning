of a raw youthwho is placed about his person the state of doubt inwhich the reader might for a time be as to the truthof the charges and the consequences growing out ofthese causes seemed to me to afford scope for a narrativeof no common interest i was not disappointedcaleb williams was honoured with the public favourthe consequence was that i was solicited to try myhand again in a work of fiction i hesitated long idespaired of finding again a topic so rich of interestand passion in those days it was deemed a mostdaring thought to attempt to write a novel with thehope that it might hereafter rank among the classicsof a language the most successful english writersvi advertisementin that province of literature had scarcely gonebeyond three it had not then been conceived that thesame author might produce twenty or thirty at therate of two or three per annum and might still at leastretain his hold upon the partiality of his contemporariesto sir walter scott we are indebted for thisdiscoveryat length after having passed some years in astate of diffidence and irresolution i ventured on thetask it struck me that if i could mix human feelingsand passions with incredible situations i mightthus attain a sort of novelty that would conciliate thepatience at least even of some of the severest judgesto this way of thinking st leon was indebted for alocal habitation and a nameone of my most valued friends mr northcotehas often told me that the public may sometimes beinterested in the perusal of a book but that they nevergive themselves any trouble about the author hetherefore kindly advised me on no occasion to say anythingin print about myself the present race ofreaders seem scarcely disposed to verify this maximthey are understood to be desirous to learn somethingof the peculiarities the life character and behaviourof an author before they consign him to thegulph of oblivion and are willing to learn from his owntestimony what train of thoughts induced him to adoptthe particular subject and plan of the work upon theperusal of which they are engagedjune prefacethe following passage from a work said to be written bythe late dr john campbel and entitled hermippus redivivusj suggested the first hint of the present performancethere happened in the year an odd accident atvenice that made a very great stir then and which ithink deserves to be rescued from oblivion the greatfreedom and ease with which all persons who make a goodappearance live in that city is known sufficiently to allwho are acquainted with it such will not therefore be surprisedthat a stranger who went by the name of signorgualdi and who made a considerable figure there wasadmitted into the best company though nobody knew whoor what he was he remained at venice for some monthsand three things were remarked in his conduct the firstwas that he had a small collection of fine pictures whichhe readily showed to any body that desired it the nextthat he was perfectly versed in all arts and sciences andspoke on every subject with such readiness and sagacity asastonished all who heard him and it was in the third placeobserved that he never wrote or received any letter neverdesired any credit or made use of bills of exchange butpaid for every thing in ready money and lived decentlythough not in splendourcf this gentleman met one day at the coffeehouse witha venetian nobleman who was an extraordinary good judgeof pictures he had heard of signor gualdi's collection andin a very polite manner desired to see them to which theother very readily consented after the venetian hadvlll prefaceviewed signer gualdi's collection and expressed his satisfactionby telling him that he had never seen a finer consideringthe number of pieces of which it consisted he casthis eye by chance over the chamberdoor where hung apicture of this stranger the venetian looked upon it andthen upon him this picture was drawn for you sirsays he to signor gualdi to which the other made no answerbut by a low bow you look continued the venetian like a man of fifty and yet i know this picture tobe of the hand of titian who has been dead one hundredand thirty years how is this possible it is not easysaid signor gualdi gravely to know all things that arepossible but there is certainly no crime in my being likea picture drawn by titian the venetian easily perceivedby his manner of speaking that he had given the strangeroffence and therefore took his leavec he could not forbear speaking of this in the eveningto some of his friends who resolved to satisfy themselvesby looking upon the picture the next day in order tohave an opportunity of doing so they went to the coffeehouseabout the time that signor gualdi was wont to comethither and not meeting with him one of them who hadoften conversed with him went to his lodgings to enquireafter him where he heard that he had set out an hour beforefor vienna this affair made a great noise and founda place in all the

descended from one of the most ancient and honourablefamilies of the kingdom of france i was the onlychild of my father who died while i was an infant mymother was a woman of rather a masculine

the greatness of my ancestorsand she indefatigably sought to kindle in my bosoma similar flame it has been a longestablished custom forthe barons and feudal vassals of the kings of france toenter with great personal expense into the brilliant anddazzling expeditions of their sovereigns and my fathergreatly impaired his fortune in preparations for that verycampaign in which he terminated his life my

excitedzealously to apply myself to the lessons they taughti became intimately acquainted with the italian writers ofthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries i was initiated in thestudy of the classics to the cultivation of which the revivalof letters at this time gave particular ardour i was instructedin the principles of the fine arts there was nospecies of accomplishment at that time in vogue that mymother was not anxious i should make my own the onlyscience i neglected was the very science which has sincegiven rise to the most extraordinary events of my life butthe object to which my attention was principally calledwas the pursuit of military exercises and the cultivation ofevery thing that could add to the strength agility or graceof my body and to the adventurousness and enterprise ofmy mind my mother loved my honour and my famemore than she loved my persona circumstance that tended perhaps more than any otherto fix the yet fluctuating character of my youthful mindwas my being present as a spectator at the celebrated meetingbetween francis the first and henry the eighth kingof england in a field between ardres and guineas mymother refused to accompany me being already arrived atan age in which curiosity and the love of festive scenes areusually diminished and the expenses incurred by all thenobility who attended upon this scene being incompatiblewith the economy to which she rigidly adhered i wastherefore placed under the protection of the marquis devilleroy her brother and with two servants who attendedme formed a part of his suitetravels of st leon oi was at this time fifteen years of age my contemplationshad been familiar with ideas of magnificence andgrandeur but my life had been spent in the most sequesteredretirement this contrast had a particular effectupon my disposition it irritated to a very high degree mypassion for splendour and distinction i lived in the fairyfields of visionary greatness and was more than indifferentto the major part of the objects around me i pined forevery thing the reverse of my present condition i cultivatedthe exercises in which i was engaged only as theywere calculated to prepare me for future achievementsby the incident i have mentioned i was transported atonce from a scene of modest obscurity to a scene of themost lavish splendour that the world perhaps ever contemplatedi never remembered to have seen even paris itselfthe prevailing taste of europe has for some time led verymuch to costliness in dress this taste in its present profusioni believe took its rise in the field of the vale ofardres the two kings were both in the vigour of theiryouth and were said to be the handsomest men of the agein which they lived the beauty of henry was sturdy andmuscular that of francis more refined and elegant withoutsubtracting in any considerable degree from the firmnessof his make henry was four years older than hisbrother monarch the first of them might have been takenas a model to represent a youthful

hisshoulders nor was the variety of garments inferior to therichness wolsey a man whose magnificence of dispositionwas only surpassed by the pride of his soul was for themost part the director of the whole he possessed the mostabsolute ascendancy over the mind of his master at thesame time that francis artfully indulged his caprice thathe might claim from him in return a similar indulgence inweightier mattersthe pomp of processions and the ceremony of openingthis memorable festival went first a sort of solemn andb travels of st leonhalfmoving pageant which the eye took in at leisure andtook in till it was filled this was succeeded by everythingthat was rapid animated and interesting masquesand exhibitions of ah kinds and which was still more tomeand which my soul devoured with indescribable ardourhustings tilts and tournaments without end the beautyof the armour the caparisons of the steeds the mettle ofthe animals themselves and the ardour and grace of thecombatants surpassed every thing that my fancy had everpainted these scenes were acted in the midst of a vastamphitheatre of spectators where all that was noble andeminent of either country was assembled the manliness ofaspiring youth and the boundless varieties of female attractionall were in their gayest attire every eye waslighted up with complacency and joy if heraclitus orany other morose philosopher who has expatiated on theuniversal misery of mankind had entered the field of ardreshe must have retracted his assertions or fled from thescene with confusion the kings were placed at either endof the lists surrounded with their courtiers every eyethrough this vast assembly was fixed upon the combatants the body of every one present was inclined this way or thatin unconscious sympathy with the redoubled knights fromtime to time as the favourites of either party prevailed theair was rent with shouts and acclamationswhat added to the fascination of all that i have yetmentioned was that now for the first time in an equaldegree perhaps for centuries the stiffness of unwieldy formwas laid aside and the heart of man expanded itself withgenerosity and confidence it burst the fetters of ages and having burst them it seemed to revel in its newfoundliberty it is well known that after a few days of idleprecaution and specious imprisonment on both sides francisone morning mounted his horse and appeared withoutguards or any previous notice before the tent of henrythe example was contagious and from this time all ceremonywas laid aside the kings themselves entered personallyinto the combats of their subjects it was adelightful and a ravishing spectacle to witness the freedomof the old roman manners almost of the old roman saturnof st leon alia polished and refined with all that was graceful andhumane in the age of chivalryit may easily be imagined what an effect a scene likethis was calculated to produce upon a youth of my age andmy education i recollected with anguish that the immaturityof my years precluded me from taking any activepart in the spectacle my appearance however was sufficientlyadvantageous i was presented to francis thefirst he did me the honour to question me respectingmy studies and finding in me some knowledge of thosearts and that literature of which he was himself so zealousa favourer he expressed to my uncle a great satisfactionwith my figure and acquisitions i might from this timehave been taken to court and made one of the pages tothis illustrious monarch but the plan of my mother wasdifferent she did not wish for the present that my eyeshould be satiated with public scenes or that the publicshould grow too familiarly acquainted with my person sherightly judged that my passion for the theatre of glorywould grow more impetuous by being withheld for sometimefrom the gratifications for which it panted she wishedthat i should present myself for the first time amongthe nobility of france an accomplished cavalier and notsuffer the disadvantage of having exposed in the eye of theworld those false steps and frailties from which the inexperienceof youth is never entirely free these motives beingexplained to the king he was graciously pleased tosanction them with his approbation i accordingly returnedto finish the course of my education at my paternal chateauupon the banks of the garonnethe state of my mind during the three succeeding yearsamply justified the sagacity of my mother i was moreeager for improvement than i had ever yet been ihad before formed some conceptions of the career of honourfrom the books i had read and from the conversation ofthis excellent matron but my reveries were impotent andlittle compared with what i had now seen like the authorof our holy religion i had spent my forty days withoutfood in the wilderness when suddenly my eyes wereopened and i was presented with all the kingdoms of theb travels of st leonworld and all the glory of them the fairy scene continuedfor a moment and then vanished leaving nothingbehind it on all sides but the same barrenness and gloomby which it had been preceded i never shut my eyeswithout viewing in imagination the combats of knights andthe train of ladies i had been regarded with distinctionby my sovereign and francis the first stood before mymind the abstract and model of perfection and greatnessi congratulated myself upon being born in an age andcountry so favourable to the acquisition of all that my souldesiredi was already eighteen years of age when i experiencedthe first misfortune that ever befel me it was the deathof my

result of a most sincere and exclusive attachment and never did man more deserve to be loved than reginaldde st leon when he died the whole world would havebeen nothing to me but one vast blank if he had not leftbehind him the representative of his person and the heirto his virtues while i was busied in your education iseemed to be discharging the last duty to the memory ofmy husband the occupation was sacred to the honour ofthe dead even before it became so peculiarly pleasing tomeupon its own account as i afterwards found it i hopei have in some measure discharged the task in the mannerin which my lord your father would have wished it to havebeen discharged if he had lived i am thankful to heaventhat i have been spared so long for so dear and honourablea purposeyou must now my son stand by yourself and be thearbitrator of your own actions i could have wished thatthis necessity might have been a little further deferred but i trust your education has not been of that sort whichtravels of st leon is calculated to render a young man helpless and contemptibleyou have been taught to know your rank in societyand to respect yourself you have been instructed in everythingthat might most effectually forward you in the careerof glory there is not a young cavalier among all the nobilityof france more accomplished or that promises to dogreater honour to his name and his

severe blow to my heartfor some time all the visions of greatness and renown whichhad hitherto been my chosen delight appeared distastefulto me i hung over her insensible corpse when it hadbeen committed to the earth i repaired every day to thespot where it was deposited at the hour of dusk when allvisible objects faded from the eye when nature assumedher saddest tints and the whole world seemed about to bewrapped in the darkness of the tomb the dew of nightdrizzled unheeded on my head and i did not turn againtowards the turrets of the chateau till the hour of midnighthad already

over that i should remain in indolence the tenderremembrance of my mother itself in no long time furnisheda new stimulus to my ambition i forgot the melancholyspectacle of the last struggles of her expiring lifei even became accustomed no longer to hear her voice nolonger to expect her presence when i returned to the chateaufrom a short excursion her last advice was now all thatsurvived of the author of my existencechapter iii was in this state of mind when early one morning in thebeginning of summer soon after i rose i was startled bythe sound of trumpets in the plain near the chateau thebugle at the gate was presently sounded the drawbridgewas let down and the marquis de villeroy entered thecourtyard accompanied by about thirty knights in completearmour i saluted him with respect

heard something imperfectlyof the state of my country but my mother carefullykept me in ignorance that my ambition might not be excitedtoo soon and that when excited it might be with thefullest effect while i impatiently longed for an occasionof glory i was far from apprehending what i now foundto be true that the occasion which at this period presenteditself was such that all the licence of fiction could scarcelyhave improved itthe marquis de villeroy described to me the league nowsubsisting against france he revived in my memory byterms of the most fervent loyalty the accomplishments andtalents of my royal master he spoke with aversion of thephlegmatic and crafty disposition of his imperial rival and with the language of glowing indignation inveighedagainst the fickleness of the capricious henry t he describedthe train of disasters which had at length inducedthe king to take the field in person he contrasted withgreat effect the story of the gallant chevalier bayard theknight

had urged to join theenemies of his country in neglect of his loyalty and hisoath he stimulated me by the example of the one andthe infamy of the other and assured me that there neverwas an

waswitnessed by the setting sun my excellent mother hadleft my revenues in the best order and i spared no expensein the gratification of my favourite passionhowever eager i felt myself to take the field the desireto appear in a manner worthy of a count de st leon restrainedme and i did not join the royal army till theimperialists having broken up the siege of marseilles andretreated with precipitation into italy the king had alreadycrossed the alps entered the milanese and gained un contestedpossession of the capitalfrom milan francis proceeded to pavia glory was theidol of his heart

acquired such at least were themotives that he assigned for his proceedings in realityperhaps he was principally induced by the brilliancy whichhe conceived would attend on the undertakingit was a few weeks after the opening of the siege thati presented myself to my royal master he received mewith those winning and impressive manners by which hewas so eminently distinguished he recollected immediatelyall that had passed at our interview in the vale ofardres and warmly expressed the obligations which francehad at various times owed to my ancestors he spoke withearnest respect of the

defended by a small but veteran garrison and byone of the ablest captains that europe at that time possessedhe interrupted the approaches of the besiegersby frequent and furious sallies in vain by the aid of ourexcellent artillery did we make wide and repeated breachesin the fortifications no sooner did we attempt to enter bythe passage we had opened than we found ourselves encounteredby a body composed of the choicest and bravestsoldiers of the garrison the governor of the city whothough greyheaded and advanced in years was profuse ofevery youthful exertion was ordinarily at the head of thisbody if we deferred our attack or not having succeededin it proposed to commence it anew with the dawn of thefollowing day we were sure to find a new wall sprung upin the room of the other as if by enchantment frequentlythe governor anticipated the success of our batteries and the old fortification was no sooner demolished than webeheld to our astonishment and mortification a new wallwhich

which it might be gratifiedstrange as it may seem this scene of a wintercamp in themidst of blood and sweat surrounded with dangers and calledon for unparalleled exertions appears to me through the vistaof years that is now interposed between to have been one ofthe happiest of my life the gay labours and surprises ofthe day were succeeded by a convivial evening in whichwe did not the less open our hearts though frequentlyliable to be interrupted in our midnight revels by the inexhaustibleactivity and stratagems of the enemy in thisvarious and evershifting scene i forgot the disasters thatoccurred and the blood that flowed around me all senseof a large and impartial morality was for the time at leastdeadened in my breast i was ever upon the alert thediversity of events neither

recruit his vigour and renovatehis strength there was yet another class of persons in thecamp whose gaiety was much less interrupted than minethese were the king and the generals who commandedunder

eventantonio de leyva governor of the city necessarily felthimself alarmed at the extraordinary project in which wewere engaged and made every exertion to prevent it oneevening the king sent for me to his tent and told me inconfidence that the enemy intended that very night to makethree several attacks upon our mound one on each side ofthe stream and one by means of boats in the centre twoof these he said were merely intended as feints the westbank of the tesino was the point against which their principalexertions would be directed on that side he wasresolved to command in person the boats with which heproposed to resist their flota he confided to one of the mostfamous and valuable officers of his army the detachmenton the east bank he purposed to intrust to my uncle andmyself he observed that the detachment he could sparefor that purpose after having formed the other two bodiesand reserved a sufficient number for the defence of thecamp and the works would be small and he warned meto

me to approach very near to the expectedroute of our assailants without being perceived bythem the night was extremely dark yet the vicinity ofmy position was such that i could count the numbers ofthe

king a youngknight my particular friend who happened to be with meto urge the necessity of a reinforcement at the same timei sent a messenger to my uncle by a circuitous route toinform him of what i

blows were struck at random afrenchman was not less dreadful than a spaniard whenthe battle ceased scarcely one of the enemy was left alive but we observed with astonishment and horror the numberc

jocundness of the campaign all after thiswas one continued series of disaster about the close ofjanuary our work though not wholly interrupted was considerablyretarded by a succession of heavy rains thiswas injurious to us in many ways our project which wasexecuted in the midst of waters rendered additional dampa matter of serious consideration we were also seizedwith an apprehension of still greater magnitude which wasspeedily realised the snows being at length completelydissolved and the quantity of water continually increasingwe perceived one afternoon strong symptoms that ourmound the principal subject of our labour and source ofour hope was giving way in various places the nextmorning at daybreak it rushed down every where at oncewith wonderful violence and noise it is difficult to describethe sensation of anguish which was instantly anduniversally diffused the labour of many weeks was overthrownin a moment as we had proceeded in our workwe every day saw ourselves nearer the object to which weaspired at this time our project was almost completed andpavia was in imagination already in our hands to gainpossession of which had cost us such unremitted exertionsthe display of so much gallantry and the loss of so manysoldiers we were confounded at the catastrophe we sawwe gazed at each other each in want of encouragementand every one unable to afford itstill however we were not destitute of advantages thegarrison began to be in want both of ammunition and provisionsthey were in a general state of discontent almostof mutiny which scarcely all the address and authority ofthe governor were able to suppress if the town continuedlonger unrelieved it was sure to fall into our hands buteven this our last hope was considerably diminished by theintelligence we received the very day after the destructionof our mound that the imperial army after having receivedlarge reinforcements was approaching in considerable forcethe king had some time before in the height of his contravelsof st leon licence and elation of his heart sent off a detachment ofsix thousand men to invade the kingdom of naples forupon that as well as the milanese he had inherited pretensionsfrom his

and their country's honourthe king who commanded them seemed expressly formedto obtain their attachment and affection his nobles becameenthusiastic by the example of his enthusiasm and willinglydisbursed their revenues to give prosperity and eclat to thecampaignthe first question that arose upon the approach of theenemy was whether we should break up the siege andattend in some strong post the slow but sure effect of theirwant of money and the consequent dispersion of theirtroops or wait their attack in our present posture theformer advice was safe but to the gallant spirit of francisit appeared ignominious he was upon all occasions thepartisan of rapid measures and decisive proceedings andhis temper with the exception of a few wary and deliberatecounsellors accorded with that of our whole army forsome days we congratulated ourselves upon the wisdom ofour choice we presented to the enemy so formidable anappearance that notwithstanding the cogent motives hehad to proceed he hesitated long before he ventured toattack us at length however the day came that waspregnant with so momentous expectationif through the whole limits of our camp there was notaman that did

there was no object of sight so ravishing as the firmand equal steps of the martial bands the impatience of thewarhorse and the display of military standards nor anymusic so enchanting as the shrillness of the pipe theclangor of the trumpet the neighing of steeds and theroaring of cannon it is thus that man disguises to himselfthe real nature of his occupation and clothes that whichis of

saw one of my most intimateand familiar companions killed before my eyes itwas not long however before a party of fugitive frenchcame up to the spot where i stood and i like the rest washurried from the field my uncle perished in the battleit is wonderful how men can harden their hearts againstsuch scenes as i then witnessed it is wonderful howthey can be brought to cooperate in such demoniac furyand more than demoniac mischief barbarity and murderbut they are brought to it and enter not from a deplorablenecessity but as to a festival in which each man is eagerto occupy his place and share the amusements it seemedto me at that time as it seems to me now that it shouldbe enough for a man to contemplate such a field as i sawat pavia to induce him to abjure the trade of violence foreverand to commit his sword once more to the bowelsof the earth from which it was torn for so nefarious apurposethese sensations though now finally established in mymind were at the time of which i am writing

passion returned upon meinits original ardour my convictions and the moral integrityof my soul were temporary and i became myselfa monument of that inconstancy and that wonder to whichi have just

france by this eventfound the list of her noblesse considerably reduced in numbers add to which those whose loss she sustained werealmost all of them taken from among the most distinguishedand meritorious in the cataloguebut what constituted the principal feature in this memorableevent was that the king himself was found in thenumber of the prisoners nor was he released by his ungenerouscompetitor till after more than a twelvemonth'sconfinement during this period francis tasted of thedregs of adversity inclined in the first instance to judgeof his rival by himself he expected a liberal treatment inthis he was deeply disappointed after a detention ofmany months in the milanese the scene of his former successeshe was transferred to madrid he was personallyneglected by the emperor while his disloyal subject wastreated with singular distinction the most rigorous termswere proposed to him all this had the effect in one instanceof sinking him into a disease of languor and dejectionwhich he was not expected to survive and in anotherof inducing him to execute an instrument by which he abdicatedthe crown and declared his resolution of remaininga prisoner for life his confinement was at length terminatedby his solemnly engaging to compulsory articles whichhe was determined to break as soon as he found himself atliberty an alternative peculiarly grating to the liberalityof his spirit this reverse of fortune materially changed hischaracter the fine spirit of his ambition was from thistime evaporated and while he still retained the indefeasiblequalities

indulgences of the table that concentrated spirit which had sought to expand itselfupon the widest stage now found vent in the exhibition ofindividual expense and above all the sordid and

alleged indeed and with considerable justicethat the habit of gaming is an exception to this statementit was with hesitation and reluctance that i entered intothis habit i saw it as it was and as every ingenuous anddebauched mind must see it base and sordid the possessionof some degree of wealth i regarded indeed as indispensableto a man who would fill a lofty and respectablecharacter in the

amorous constitution i should perhaps havequieted the restlessness of my appetites without ostentationand eclat had not the conduct of my youthful associates ingeneral led me to regard gallantry as an accomplishmentindispensably necessary in a young man of rank it mustbe confessed indeed that this offence against the rigour ofdiscipline has a thousand advantages over that of gamingfew women of regular and reputable lives have that ease ofmanners that flow of fancy and that graceful intrepidityof thinking and expressing themselves that is sometimes tobe found among those who have discharged themselves fromthe tyranny of custom there is something irresistiblycaptivating in that voluptuousness which while it assumesa certain air of freedom uniformly and with preferenceconforms itself to the dictates of unsophisticated delicacya judicious and limited voluptuousness is necessary to thecultivation of the mind to the polishing of the manners tothe refining of sentiment and the

fortune has blindly lavished her favoursit is honourable if he have declined the means ofenriching himself by the sacrifice of his independence andhis principles but of all earthly things the most contemptibleis the man who having wasted his goods inriotous living yet hungers after the luxuries that haveproved his bane and feasts himself upon the steam ofdainties of which he has lost the

should have a more genuine and instantaneous relishfor one sort of excellence and another for another thuswe added to each other's stores and acquired a largeness ofconception and liberality of judgment that neither of uswould have arrived at if separate it is difficult to imaginehow prolific this kind of amusement proved of true happinesswe were mutually delighted to remark the accordof our

unfortunatecoincidence miserable rather let me say guilty abandonedmiscreant as soon as i rose in the morning i went to the closetwhere the evening before i had deposited my recent acquisitionsi spread out the gold before me i gazedupon it with intentness my eyes a moment after rolledin vacancy i traversed the apartment with impatient stepsall the demon seemed to make his descent upon my

overwhelmed me my mind did not oncerecur to the possibility of any serious mischief i dweltonly as gamesters perhaps usually do upon the alternativebetween acquisition and no acquisition i did not

i felt though darkly and unwillinglythe immorality of my conception to game mayin some instances not be in diametrical opposition to liberalityof mind but he who games for the express purposeof improving his circumstances must be an idiot if he doesnot sometimes recollect that the money lost may be as seriousa mischief to his neighbour as the money gained canpossibly be a benefit to himself it is past a question thathe who thus turns his amusement into his business losesthe dignity of a man of honour and puts himself upon alevel with the most avaricious and usurious merchantthough i was far from having digested a specific planof enriching myself by these discreditable means yet thevery tumult of my thoughts operated strongly to lead meonce more to the gamingtable i was in no humour tobusy myself with my own thoughts the calmness of literarydiscussion and the polished interchange of wit which hadlately so much delighted me had now no attraction for myheart the turbulence of a scene of high play alone hadpower to distract my attention from the storm within iwon a second time i felt the rapidity and intenseness ofmy contemplations still further accelerated i will not

adventures it threw me in the first place intothe hands of notorious gamblers men of real propertyshrunk from the stakes i proposed as though they werein some degree infected with the venom of gaming theirinfection was not so deep as mine nor with my desperationof thought the players with whom i engaged were forthe most part well known to every one but myself not tobe able to pay the sums they played for if they lost naythis fact might be said in some sense to be known to me aswell as the rest though i obstinately steeled myself againstthe recollection of it one evening i won of one of thesepersons a very large sum for which i suffered him to playwith me upon honour the consequence was simple thenext morning he took his departure from paris and i heardof him no morebefore this however the tide of success had set stronglyagainst me i had sustained some serious vicissitudes and while i was playing with the wretch i have just mentionedmy eagerness increased as my good luck

project of supplyingthe inadequateness of my fortune by this expedient beganto produce an effect exactly opposite i could not but withthe extremest difficulty string my mind to write to themistress of

changethe animosity with which she has lately pursued me iwill repair the breaches that have been sustained and ishall then return with tenfold avidity to subjects that atpresent i dare not fix my mind upon my letters wereaccordingly short unfrequent and unsatisfactory andthose of marguerite discovered increasing anguish perturbationand anxiety what a change in the minds ofboth had the lapse of a few months produced not thatmy attachment had suffered the diminution of a singleparticle but that attachment which had lately been thesource of our mutual felicity was now fraught only withdistress my mind was filled with horrors and margueriteexpected from me an encouragement and consolation inabsence which alas i had it not in my power to give i had now continued in paris for a time vastly greaterthan i had originally proposed after having remainedmore than ten days without receiving one word of intelligencea letter of mine was delivered to marguerite moreshort mysterious and distressing to her feelings than anythat had preceded the ten days silence from me whoat first had never missed an opportunity of pouring outmy soul to her and contributing to her pleasure was exquisitelypainful there is scarcely any thing that producessuch a sickness of the heart as the repeated prorogationof hope but when the letter arrived that hadbeen so anxiously looked for when the handwriting ofthe superscription was recognised when the letter wastreasured up for the impatiently desired moment of solitudethat the sacred emotions of the heart might suffer nointerruption and when it at last appeared so cold soominous so withering to the buds of affection the detertravelsof st leon lmention of marguerite was speedily formed the relationsthat bound us together were of too mighty

contempt of every thing sacred entered into some newattachment had the attractions of some new beauty inthe metropolis made me indifferent to the virtue of mychildren and the life of their mother perhaps the lengthof our attachment had infected me with satiety and theinconstancy of my temper had been roused by the charmsof novelty perhaps the certainty of her kindness andregard had no longer allurements for me and i might beexcited to the pursuit of another by the pleasures of hopecombined with uncertainty and of a coyness that seemedto promise compliance hereafter even while it pronounceda present denial these were the images that haunted hermind they engendered all the wildness and all the tormentsof a delirious paroxysm she resolved that no timeshould be sacrificed to needless uncertainty and that noeffort of hers should be unexpected to prevent the mischiefshe fearedit was evening when she arrived i was upon thepoint of repairing to that scene of nightly resort the sourceof all my guilt and all my miseries i enquired of myson's valet where he was and how he had been in thecourse of the day he was gone to bed he had appearedunusually sad sometimes in tears and while he wasoxs travels op st leonundressing had sighed deeply two or three times whilei was collecting this account in my own apartment thegates of the hotel opened and a number of

expectedher arrival i should infallibly have met her at thismoment with anxiety and confusion i should have goneround the circle of my thoughts and should not have hadconfidence to encounter the beam

rose and during the hours of darkness its roaringwere hollow and tempestuousin the morning the clouds were hurried rapidly alongand the air was changed from a long series of sultriness toa nipping cold this change of the atmosphere i disregardedand pursued my rambles a little before noonhowever the air suddenly grew so dark as to produce asensation perfectly tremendous i felt as if the darkestnight had never exceeded it the impetuous motion towhich i had been impelled partly by the fever in my bloodand partly by the turbulence of the season was suspendedmechanically i looked round me for shelter but i couldill distinguish the objects that were near me when a flashof lightning blue and sulphureous came directly in myface with a brightness that threatened to extinguish theorgan of vision the thunder that followed was of alength and loudness to admit of no comparison from anyobject with which i am acquainted the bursts were sofrequent as almost to confound themselves with each otherat present i thought only of myself and the recent habitsof my mind were not calculated to make me peculiarly accessibleto fear i stood awestruck but rather with the awethat inheres to a cultivated imagination than that whichconsists in apprehension i seemed ready to mount amidstthe clouds and penetrate the veil with which nature concealsher operations i would have plunged into the recessesin which the storm was engendered and bared my bosomto the streaming fire meanwhile my thoughts were solemnisedand fixed by observing the diversified dance of thelightnings upon the points of the rocks contrasting as theydid in the strongest manner with the darkness in whichthe rest of the scene was enveloped this added contentionof the elements did not however suspend the ragingtravels of st leon of the wind presently a storm of mingled hail and rainpoured from the clouds and was driven with inconceivableimpetuosity the hailstones were of so astonishing a magnitudethat before i was aware i was beaten by them tothe ground not daring to attempt to rise again i simplyendeavoured to place myself in such a manner as might bestprotect me from their violence i therefore remained prostratelistening to the force with which they struck upon theearth and feeling the rebound of their blows from differentparts of my bodyin about twenty minutes the shower abated and in halfan hour was entirely over when i began to move i wassurprised at the sensation of soreness which i felt in everypart of me i raised myself upon my elbow and saw thehailstones in some places lying in heaps like hillocks ofice while in others they had ploughed up the surface andburied themselves in the earth as i looked further i perceivedimmense trees torn from their roots and thrown toa great distance upon the declivity to the noise that theymade in their descent which must have been astonishinglygreat i had been at the time insensible such were themarks which the tempest had left upon the mountainsin the plain it was still worse i could perceive the soilfor long spaces together converted into a morass the standingcorn beaten down and buried in the mud the vinestorn into a thousand pieces the fruit trees demolished andeven in some places the animals themselves lambs sheep andcows strewing the fields with their mangled carcasses thewhole hopes of the year over which my eyes had glanced afew minutes before for it was near the period of harvestwere converted into the most barren and dreary scene thatany quarter of the globe ever witnessed i was mountedupon a considerable eminence and had an extensive prospectof this horrible devastationas i stood gazing in mute astonishment suddenly a fearcame over me that struck dampness to my very heartwhat was the situation of my own family and their littleremaining property amidst this dreadful ruin i was inaposition where though i nearly faced our habitation apoint of the rock intercepted it from my sight the travels op st

extensive scene openedupon me in an instant what were my sensations wheni perceived that the devastation had been even more completehere than on the side where i first viewed it myown cottage in

idea upon our retreat into switzerlandhad been that of conforming without reserve to the newsituation that was allotted us had immediately expendedthe whole of what remained from the shipwreck of our

greatestdifficulty and not without many circuitous deviations thati proceeded so much was the surface changed and sodeep arid miry the swamps my terror increased as ipassed near to the carcasses of the animals who had fallenvictims to this convulsion of the elements i observedwith inconceivable alarm that the dead or wounded bodiesof some human beings were intermingled with the brutedestruction i stayed not to enquire whether they were yetin a state to require assistance the idea that had takenpossession of me left no room for the sentiment of generalhumanitya little further on i distinctly remarked the body of awoman at some distance from any habitation who appearedto be dead destroyed by the storm near her lay a femaleinfant apparently about six years of age my attentionwas

existence to be compared with this ifi had not felt what i then felt i could never have conceivedit human nature is so constituted that the highestdegree of anguish an anguish in which the heart stretchesitself to take in the mightiness of its woe can be felt butfor a few instants when the calamity we feared is alreadyarrived or when the expectation of it is so certain as toshut out hope

with luxuries you willbe our protector and our support travels op st leonthus saying she took me by the hand and motionedme to view with her the devastation that had been committedthere was one path i had discovered in whichwe might proceed some way with tolerable ease thescene was terrible we were indeed beggars a wholeprovince had been destroyed all the corn and the fruitsof the earth most of the trees in many places cattlein some places men persons who had been rich in themorning saw all the produce of their fields annihilatedand were unable even to guess by what process fertilitywas to be reestablished the comparatively wealthyscarcely knew how they were to obtain immediate subsistence the humbler class who always live by the expedientsof the day saw nothing before them but the prospect ofperishing with hunger we witnessed in one or two instancesthe anguish of their despairour prospect was scarcely in any respect better thantheirs yet we felt differently we were more impressedwith the joy of our personal escape as my error respectingthe value of externals had been uncommonly great thesudden revolution of opinion i experienced was equally memorablethe survey indeed that we took of the generaldistress somewhat saddened our hearts but the sadness itgave was that of sobriety not of dejectionit was incumbent upon us to make a strict examinationinto the amount of our property and our immediate resources and in this office i united myself with margueritenot only with a degree of cheerfulness and application theperfect contrast of my whole conduct ever since our arrivalin switzerland but which greatly exceeded any thing i hadever before exhibited in a business of this nature wefound that though all our hopes of a harvest were annihilatedyet we were not destitute of the instant means ofsubsistence the resources we possessed whether in moneyor provisions that were our dependence till the period whenthe new produce should supply their place were uninjuredour implements of husbandry remained s before theland was not impoverished but had rather derived additionalfertility from the effects of the storm what wehad lost was chiefly the produce of our capital for one yeartravels op st leon together with a part of that capital itself in the live stockthat had been destroyed this was a loss which a certaindegree of care and scope in our external circumstancesmight easily have enabled us to supply but the principleof supply was denied us it was with considerable difficultythat all the economy of marguerite had enabled herto support our family establishment while every thing ofthis kind had gone on prosperously such a shock as thepresent we were totally disqualified to surmount it compelledus to a complete revolution of our affairsmany indeed of our neighbours had scarcely any greateradvantage in their private affairs than ourselves but theypossessed one superiority that proved of the greatest importancein this conjuncture they were natives of the statein which they resided in the cantons of switzerland thedestruction of the fruits of the earth occasioned by inclementseasons and tempests is by no means unfrequent andit is therefore customary in plentiful years to lay up cornin public magazines that the people may not perish in periodsof scarcity these magazines are placed under theinspection and disposal of the magistracy and the inhabitantslooked to them with confidence for the supply of theirneed no storm however had occurred in the memory ofman so terrible and ruinous as the present and it becameevident that the magazines would prove a resource toofeeble for the extent of the emergencythe storm had spread itself over a space of many leaguesin circumference not only in the canton of soleure but inthe neighbouring cantons particularly that of berne thesufferers in our own canton only amounted to scarcely lessthan ten thousand while the women and children forthe most part remained at home the houses having ingeneral suffered little other damage than the destruction oftheir windows the fathers of families repaired to the seatof government to put in their claims for national relief and these alone formed an immense troop that threatenedlittle less than to besiege the public magazines and the magistratesan accurate investigation was entered into of thelosses of each it being the purpose of government as far asits power extended not only to supply the people with the travels of st leonmeans of immediate subsistence but also by disbursementsfrom the public treasury to recruit the stock of cattle andto assist every one to return with revived hopes and expectationto the sphere of his industry the purpose was nodoubt benevolent but in the mean time the unhappyvictims found in uncertainty and expectation a real andcorroding anguishi advanced my claim with the rest but met with aperemptory refusal the harsh and rigorous answer ireceived was that they had not enough for their ownpeople and could spare nothing to strangers upon thisoccasion i was compelled to feel what it was to be an alienand how different the condition in which i was now placedfrom that i had filled in my native country there i hadlived in the midst of a people to whom the veneration ofmy ancestry and name seemed a part of their nature theyhad witnessed for several years the respectable manner inwhich i lived the virtues of marguerite were familiar tothem and they took an interest in every thing that concernedus a sentiment that confessed us at once for kindredand patrons it was the turn of mind only which isgenerated by rank that had compelled us to quit theirvicinity we might have continued in it if not in affluenceat least enjoying the gratifications that arise from generalaffection and respect but here we were beheld with aneye of jealousy and distaste we had no prejudice of birthand habit in our favour indeed in the reverse of fortunewhich had brought us hither marguerite had been less desirousof obtruding than of withdrawing from the publiceye the circumstance of our rank we were too recentinmates to have secured by any thing of a personal naturean advantageous opinion among our neighbours they sawonly a miserable and distracted father of a family and amother who in spite of the simplicity she cultivated sufficientlyevinced that she had been accustomed to a moreelevated situation the prepossessions of mankind areclearly unfavourable to a newcomer an emigrant who hasquitted his former connections and the scenes of his youththey are unavoidably impelled to believe that his takingup his abode in another country must be owing to a weaktravels op st leon and discreditable caprice if it be not owing to somethingstill more disadvantageous to his characterthe calamity therefore which we had suffered in commonwith most of the inhabitants of the province finallyreduced us to the necessity of a second emigration thejealousy with which we were regarded daily became morevisible and threatening though in consequence of thedistribution made by order of the state the price of commoditieswas not so much increased as might have been expectedwe were considered as interlopers upon the portionof the natives the sellers could with difficulty be persuadedto accommodate us and the bystanders treated uswith murmurs and reviling while we were deliberatingwhat course to pursue in this emergency certain officers ofgovernment one morning entered our habitation producingan order of the senate for our immediate removal out of theterritory it is of the essence of coercive regulations toexpel to imprison and turn out of prison the individualsit is thought proper to control without any care as to themischiefs they may suffer and whether they perish underor survive the evil inflicted on them we were accordinglyallowed only from six in the morning till noon to preparefor our departure our guards indeed offered to permitme to remain three days to wind up my affairs upon conditionthat my wife and children were instantly removed intoanother country as a sort of hostages for my own departurethis indulgence however would have been useless in thepresent state of the country no purchaser could be foundfor the little estate i possessed and if there could it mustdoubtless have been disposed of to great disadvantage atsuch an emergency i know not how we should have extricatedourselves out of these difficulties if a member ofthe senate who being one of my nearest neighbours hadbeen struck with admiration of the virtues of margueriteand with compassion for my family had not paid me a visitshortly after the arrival of the officers and generously offeredto take upon himself the care of my property and toadvance me what money might be necessary for my emigrationthis offer which at any other time might havebeen regarded as purely a matter of course under the travels of st leonpresent circumstances when capital was so necessary forthe revival of agriculture in the desolated country implieda liberal and disinterested spirit i accepted the kindnessof my neighbour in both its parts but for the reimbursementof his loan referred him to the french minister tothe united cantons who under all the circumstances ofthe case and taking my estate as security for the moneyadvanced i thought it reasonable to believe would attendto my applicationchapter ixmy affairs being thus far adjusted i took leave of my latehabitation and set off with my wife and children the sameafternoon in the evening we arrived at basle where wewere permitted to remain that night and the next morningwere conducted in form out at the north gate of the citywhere our attendants quitted us with a fresh prohibitionunder the severest penalties if we were found within theensuing twelve months in any of the territories of thehelvetic republicmarguerite and myself had already formed our planwe began with dismissing both our servants an attendantwas no longer necessary to me nor a nurse for the infantthe suggestion of this measure originated in myself mytemper at this time as i have already said underwent astriking change i was resolved to be happy i was resolvedto be active it was hard to part with persons solong familiar to us and who appeared rather in the characterof humble friends than domestics but an imperiousnecessity demanded it let us said i to margueriteincrease and secure our happiness by diminishing ourwants i will be your husbandman and your laboureryou may depend upon my perseverance my education hasfitted me to endure hardship and fatigue though the hardshipsthen thought of were of a different nature you haveever delighted in active usefulness and will not i knowtravels of st leon repine at this accumulation of employment let us accommodateourselves to our circumstances our children iperceive are fated to be peasants and will therefore beeminently benefited by the example of patience and independencewe shall set before themthe next object of our plan related to the choice of ourfuture place of residence this originated with margueriteshe had heard much of the beauty and richness of thecountry bordering on the lake of constance and shethought that while we denied ourselves expensive pleasuresor rather while they were placed out of our reachthere would be a propriety in our procuring for ourselves astock of those pleasures which would cost us nothing thiswas a refinement beyond me and serves to evince the superioritywhich marguerite's virtue and force of mind stillretained over mine the virtue i had so recently adoptedwas a strenuous effort i rather resolved to be happy thancould strictly be said to be happy i loved my childrenindeed with an unfeigned affection it was with sinceritythat i professed to prefer them to all earthly possessionsbut vanity and ostentation were habits wrought into mysoul and might be said to form part of its essence i couldnot but by the force of constant recollection keep them outof my wishes and hopes for the future i could not likemarguerite suffer my thoughts as it were to riot andwanton in the pleasures of poverty i could only reconcilemyself to my fate by a sort of gloomy firmness the tranquillityi seemed to have attained was an unnatural stateof my soul to which it was necessary that i should resolutelyhold myself down and from which my thoughtsappeared ever upon the alert to escape bitter experiencehad at length taught me a hard lesson and that lesson i wasdetermined to practise whatever pangs my resignationmight cost mewe proceeded without hesitation in the direction we hadresolved to pursue our whole journey exceeded the spaceof forty leagues in extent and the expense necessarilyattendant upon it our family even after its reductionconsisting of no less than six persons drained our puieeof a great part of the money which had been supplied toh travels op st leonus by the benevolent senator but he had agreed to undertakethe disposing of the property we were obliged to leavebehind us and in the mean time if any considerable intervaloccurred before that was accomplished to furnish uswith the sums that should be necessary for our subsistencewe placed the utmost reliance upon his fidelity and dismissedfrom our minds all anxiety respecting the intervalwhich our banishment had interposed between us and theresources necessary for our future settlementupon our arrival at constance we found a letter fromour friend and though he transmitted to us no fresh supplythe complexion of his communication was upon thewhole so encouraging as to determine us with no other delaythan that of four days rest from our journey to passto the other side of the lake and explore for ourselves asituation suitable to our design the western bank of thelake with the exception only of the city of constance waspart of the pays conquis of the united cantons the easternbank was a territory dependent on the government of thatcity it was in this territory that we purposed fixing ourresidence and we trusted that our affairs would shortly beput in a train to enable us to take possession of the spot weshould selectthus driven once more into flight by the pressure ofmisfortune and compelled to exchange for a land unknownthe scenes which familiarity might have endeared or tenderrecollections have made interesting we did not sink underthe weight of our adversity this removal was not likeour last switzerland was to none of us endeared like thevales of st leon i was not now goaded and tormentedby conscious guilt in the degree i had then been margueritewas not afflicted by the spectacle of my miseryour present change though it might be denominated a fallwas light in comparison with the former the composurei had gained was new to me and had to my own mind all thegloss of novelty to my companions it proved contagious they were astonished at my serenity and drew from it anunwonted lightness of heartthus circumstanced our tour had its charms for us all and there are few passages of my life that i have felt moretravels of st leonagreeably the lake itself is uncommonly beautiful and itsenvirons are fertile and interesting it is surrounded withan abundance of towns villages country seats and monasteriessufficient to adorn and diversify the view but not toexclude the sweetness of a rural scenery or the grand featuresof nature we coasted a considerable part of the lakethat we might judge in some degree previously to our landingwhich part of the shore promised best to yield us theobject we sought the autumn was now commencing theair was liquid and sweet the foliage was rich and varied and the vinecovered hills exhibited a warmth and luxurianceof colouring that no other object of nature or art isable to cope with surrounded with these objects i sat inmy boat in the midst of my children and as i was butjust awakened to an observation of their worth and my ownhappiness i viewed them with a transport that would be illillustrated by being compared with the transport of a miserover his newrecovered treasure from the bowels of thedeepo poverty exclaimed i with elevated and unconquerableemotion if these are the delights that attend thee willinglywill i resign the pomp of palaces and the splendourof rank to whoever shall deem them worth his acceptance henceforth i desire

sensible that it was onlycalculated to be transitory i might learn to be contentedi was not formed to be satisfied in obscurity and a lowestatethus happy and thus amused we spent two days incoasting the lake landing frequently for the purposes eitherii travels of st leonof variety or enquiry and regularly passing the night onshore on the evening of the second day we were struckwith the neat appearance and pleasing situation of a cottagewhich we discovered in our rambles about a mile and ahalf from the lake we found that it was to be sold andit seemed precisely to correspond with the wishes we hadformed it was at a considerable distance from any populousneighbourhood the nearest town being that of merspurethe usual residence of the bishops of constancewhich was distant from this spot not less than three leaguesthe cottage was situated in a valley the hills being forthe most part crowned with rich and verdant foliage theirsides covered with vineyards and corn and a clear transparentrivulet murmuring along from east to west in thedistance a few similar cottages discovered themselves andin front there was an opening between the hills just wideenough to show us a few sails as they floated along the noweven surface of the lake we approached the cottage andfound in it only one person an interesting girl of nineteenwho had resided there from her birth and had been employedfor the last four years in attendance upon the closingscene of her mother her mother had been dead onlya few weeks and she was upon the point of removing asshe told us to the house of a brother the best creature inthe world who was already married and had a family ofchildren while we were talking with her we perceived afine boy of about eleven years of age skipping along themeadow he proved to be her nephew and hastened tosay that his father and mr henry were just behind andwould be with her in a few minutes we waited theirarrival and it was easy to see that mr henry was by nomeans an indifferent object in the eyes of the beautiful orphan she had probably conditioned that he should permither to remain single as long as she could be of any use toher mother the lovers were well satisfied that the girl'sbrother should be taken aside that i might talk over withhim the affair of the cottage we made a tour of the fieldsthat were part of the property of the deceased and theterms of our intended purchase were easily adjustedthough we had now accomplished the immediate purtravelsop st leon pose of our expedition yet as we had found unusual exhilarationand sweetness in the objects it presented to us wecame to a resolution of continuing it still further and completingthe circuit of the lake we were aware that itwould be vain as yet to expect to receive the money requisitefor completing our purchase and as no pleasuremerely in the way of relaxation could be more delightfulthan that we were now enjoying so was it impossiblethat we could fill up our time in a more frugal manner thanin this little voyage our gratification was not less butmore perfect because it consisted of simple inartificialunsought amusements the scenes around us were refreshingand invigorating they were calculated temporarily atleast to inspire gaiety and youth into decrepitude itselfamidst these scenes we forgot our sorrows they were akind of stream in which weariness and dejection plungedtheir limbs and came forth untired and alert theyawakened in the mind all its most pleasing associationshaving already as we believed chosen the place of ourfuture residence we busied ourselves in imagining ah theaccompaniments that would grow out of it we determinedthat poverty with health would not fail to be attendedwith its portion of pleasures the scenes of nature wereall our own nor could wealth give them a more perfector a firmer appropriation the affections and charities ofhabitude and consanguinity we trusted we should feel uninterruptedunincumbered with the ceremonies and trappingsof life and in that rural plainness which is theirgenial soilafter a leisurely and delightful voyage of six days wereturned to constance we expected to have found on ourreturn some further intelligence from the beneficent senatorbut in this we were disappointed the imagination howevereasily suggested to us a variety of circumstances thatmight have delayed the business he had undertaken andit was no forced inference to suppose that he deferred writingbecause he had nothing important to communicateat first therefore we suffered little uneasiness from thedelay but as time proceeded and the silence of our protectorcontinued the affair began to assume a more serioush travels op st leonaspect the little stock we had brought with us in ourexile was in a rapid progress of decay we had managedit with frugality though not at first with that anxious solicitudethe necessity of which we now began to apprehendwe had procured for ourselves two small and inconvenientapartments in an obscure alley of the city of constancewe were in the act of meditating what steps it would benecessary to take in this unfortunate emergency when intelligencewas brought us of the sudden decease of theperson upon whose kindness and exertions we dependedhe was succeeded in his estate by his nephew a man ofwhom we had heard something during our residence in theneighbourhood and whose habits we understood to be diametricallythe reverse of his predecessor's in short hehad been represented to us as illiberal morose selfish andlitigious a man who having suffered in one part of hislife the hardships of poverty scrupled no means honourableor otherwise of removing it to the greatest practicabledistance he had already reaped the succession some weekswhen we heard of the event that put him in possession ofit and the letters which i had more than once addressedto our protector had probably fallen into his hands thesecircumstances afforded no favourable augury of the treatmentwe might expect from him the first thing whichseemed proper was to write to him which i accordinglydid i acquainted him with the nature of the transactionbetween myself and his uncle and signified how necessaryit was that we should come to a conclusion as speedily aspossible i represented to him pathetically the conditionto which i was born and the opulence in which i hadpassed many years of my life together with the contrastafforded by the present reduced and urgent circumstancesof my family i entreated him to exert his generosity andjustice in behalf of an unfortunate exile whom untowardevents had deprived of the power of doing justice to himselfto this letter i received no answer uncertain as to thecause of my correspondent's silence or even whether myletter had been received i wrote again my heart waswrung with this new adversity i was forbidden undertravels op st leon pain of perpetual imprisonment to return to the territoriesof the republic and i had no friend to solicit in my behalfin constance i was utterly a stranger in switzerland myunfortunate habits of life the depression and solitude inwhich i had been merged deprived me of the opportunityof forming connections the deceased was the only personwho had been disposed to interfere for me it was tooprobable that the silence of his successor was an indicationof the hostility of his views i saw nothing before me butthe prospect of my family perishing with want deprivedof their last resource exiles and penniless thus destituteand forlorn what could we do to what plan could we haverecourse we had not so much as the means of providingourselves with the implements of the humblest labour ifwe had could i under my circumstances resolve uponthis could i give up the last slender pittance of mychildren while there was a chance of recovering it and bysurrendering them to the slavery of perpetual labour devotethem to the lowest degree of ignorance and degradation no i still clung to this final hope and was resolved toundertake any thing however desperate rather than partwith it such were my feelings and in the new letterwhich i now despatched i poured out all the anguish ofmy soula reply to this letter was at length vouchsafed theheir of my protector informed me that he knew nothing ofthe business to which i alluded that he had come intopossession of the lands i described together with the otherproperty of his late uncle and regarded himself as holdingthem by the same tenure that he found in the accounts ofthe estate a sum of money advanced to me which he mightwith the strictest justice regard as a debt and pursue mefor it accordingly he should be liberal enough howeverso far to give credit to my story and to consider the sumin question as advanced upon a pledge of land in that casei might regard myself as sufficiently fortunate in havingobtained even that amount at a time when but for the humanityor weakness of his uncle my estate would not havesold for a farthing meanwhile the forbearance which heproffered would he observed depend upon my conduct and travels of st leonbe retracted if i afforded him cause for resentment headded that he despised my menaces and commands andthat if i took a single step against him i should find itterminate in my utter ruinnothing could be more profligate than the style of hisletter but its impotence was equal to its wickedness itwas absurd to threaten to inflict ruin on a man whom ruinhad already overtaken before the letter arrived i haddisbursed the whole sum i brought with me from switzerlandthis entire annihilation of my resources seemed tosteal on me unperceived finding that all reply to myimportunity was either refused or deferred to an uncertainperiod i would willingly at all risks have sought the villainwho thus obdurately devoted me and my family to destructionand have endeavoured to obtain justice in person butit was now too late before i felt the case thus desperatemy finances were so far reduced as to make it impracticablefor me to leave my wife and children enough to supportthem in my absence even if i had determined myself toset out upon this perilous expedition penny less i resolvedthat if we did perish we would perish togetherpenury was now advancing upon us with such rapidstrides that the lowest and most scanty resources no longeradmitted of neglect had a case thus desperate been encounteredwith timely attention it is not improbable thatsome of the various talents i had acquired in the course ofmy education would have furnished me with a means ofsubsistence not altogether plebeian or incompetent butwith the uncertainty of my situation and totally unaccustomedas i was to regard my person or mind as a machinefitted for productive labour i had not looked to this questiontill the urgency of the case deprived me of every advantagei might otherwise have seized i was glad thereforeto have recourse to menial occupation and soughtemployment under the gardener of the episcopal palace forwhose service i was sufficiently qualified by my ten years'retreat in the bordelois that i might better adapt myselfto the painful necessity of my situation i previously exchangedsome of my own clothes for garments more suitableto the business i now solicited it was not till i had artravelsof st leon rived within a very few days to the end of my resourcesthat even this expedient hy a sort of accident recurred tomy mind marguerite though fully aware of the urgencyof the case had as she afterwards told me imposed onherself a compulsory silence fearing for the inflamed andirritated frame of my mind and aware that the course ofevents would ultimately lead me to a point with which shedreaded to intermeddle this was for her a trying moment my lately recovered insanity obliging her to contemplatein silence our growing distress and to wait the attackof hunger and want that threatened to destroy us with anapparent tranquillity and cheerfulnessfor me so entire a revolution had taken place in mysentiments that i spurned with contempt so far as relatedto myself that pride of rank and romantic gallantry ofhonour which had formerly been my idols i submittedwith a sort of gloomy contentment to the situation uponwhich my destiny drove me i regarded it as the naturalresult of my former misconduct and derived a sentiment ofease and relief from thus expiating as it were with thesweat of my brow the temptations to which i had yieldedhad i been myself only reduced thus low or had the produceof my labour been sufficient to purchase competencefor my wife and the means of instruction for my family ican safely affirm that i should have found no consequenceso direct from my own degradation as the means of silencingthe reproaches of conscience and reconciling me to myselfbut when i returned in the evening with the earnings ofmy day's labour and found it incompetent to the procuringfor those who depended on me the simplest means of subsistencethen indeed my sensations were different myheart died within me i did not return after the fatiguesof the day which to me who had not been accustomed tounremitted labour and who now began to feel that i wasnot so young as i had been at the siege of pavia were extremelytrying i did not return i say to a night ofrepose i became a very woman when i looked forwardand endeavoured to picture to myself the future situation ofmy family i watered my pillow with my tears oftenwhen i imagined that my whole family were asleep i gave travels of st leonvent to my perturbed and distracted mind in groans marguerite would sometimes overhear me and with thegentlest suggestions of her admirable mind would endeavourto soothe my thoughts to peace for the present asi have said my earnings were incompetent and we foundit necessary to supply the deficiency by the sale of the fewgarments not in immediate use that we still possessedwhat then would be the case when these were gone andwhen in addition to this it would be necessary to purchasenot only food to eat and a roof to shelter but alsoclothes to cover us chapter xthese deficiencies i anxiously anticipated but there wasanother evil upon which i had not calculated that was stillhearer and more overwhelming the mode of life in whichi was now engaged so different from any thing to which ihad been accustomed excessive fatigue together with theoccasional heat of the weather the uneasiness of my mindand the sleeplessness of my nights all combined to throwme into a fever which though it did not last long hadraged so furiously during the period of its continuance asto leave me in a state of the most complete debility whilethe disorder was upon me i was sensible of my danger and as the brilliant and consolatory prospects of life seemedfor ever closed upon me i at first regarded my approachingdissolution with complacency and longed to be releasedfrom a series of woes in which i had been originally involvedby my own folly this frame of mind howeverwas of no great duration the more nearly i contemplatedthe idea of separation from those i loved the smaller wasmy resignation i was unwilling to quit those dear objectsby which i still held to this mortal scene i shrunk withaversion from that barrier which separates us from all thatis new mysterious and strange another train of ideassucceeded this and i began to despise myself for my impatravels of st leonthence and cowardice it was by my vices that my familywas involved in a long train of misfortunes could i shrinkfrom partaking what i had not feared to create thegreater were the adversities for which they were reservedthe more ought i to desire to suffer with them i hadalready committed the evil in what remained it was reasonableto suppose i should prove their benefactor andnot their foe it was incumbent on me to soothe and toanimate them to enrich their minds with cheerfulness andcourage and to set before them an example of philosophyand patience by my faculties of industry i was theirprincipal hope and whatever we might suffer combinedit was probable their sufferings would be infinitely greaterif deprived of my assistance these reflections gave meenergy and it seemed as if the resolute predilection i hadconceived for life contributed much to my recoveryone thing which strongly confirmed the change mymind underwent in this respect was a conversation thati overheard at a time when i was supposed to be completelyin a state of insensibility but when though i was toomuch reduced to give almost any tokens of life my facultiesof hearing and understanding what passed around me wereentire charles came up to my bedside laid his handupon mine as if to feel the state of the skin and with ahandkerchief that was near wiped away the moisture thatbedewed my face he had been fitted for many nurselikeoffices by the unwearied attention he had exerted towardsme in the paroxysm of my insanity having finished histask he withdrew from the bed and burst into tears hismother came up to him drew him to the furthest part ofthe room and in a low voice began the conversationdo my dear boy go down stairs and get yourselfsomething to eat you see your papa is

themcome charles though you are but a boy you are thebest boy in the world you are now almost my onlycomfort but you will not be able to comfort me if you donot take care of yourselfdear mamma do you know mamma i heard thatnaughty man below stairs count up last night how muchrent you owed him for and swear you should not stay anylonger if you did not pay him if i were a little bigger iwould talk to him so that he should not dare to insult us inour distress but not being big enough i opened thedoor and went into the room and begged him for god'ssake not to add to your distress and though he is sougly i took hold of his hand and kissed it but it feltlike iron which put me in mind of his iron heart andi cried ready to burst with mortification ha did not sayhardly a wordhe must be paid charles he shall be paid do you know mamma as soon as i left him i wentto the bishop's gardens and spoke to the gardener iasked him if he had heard that my papa was ill and hesaid he had he said too he was very sorry and wantedto know what hand we made of it for want of the wages itold him we were sadly off and the man of the house hadjust been affronting me about his rent but said i cannotyou give me something to do to weed or to rake ican dig a little too and scatter seed he asked if i knewweeds from flowers oh that i do said i well thensaid he there is not much you can do but you are a goodboy and i will put you on the bishop's list but nowmamma i have not the heart to work till i see whetherpapa will get well againtravels of st leon illwhile poor charles told his artless tale marguerite weptover him and kissed him again and again she called himthe best child in the world and said that if i were hut sofortunate as to recover with such a husband and such a sonshe should yet be the happiest of womenoh my poor father exclaimed charles eversince the great hailstorm i have every hour loved himbetter than before i thought that was impossible but he isso gentle so kind so goodhumoured and so patient iloved him when he was harsh and when he was out of hismind but nothing so well then as i have done sincepeople that are kind and smile always do one good butnobody's smiles are like my father's it makes me crywith joy sometimes when i do but think of them praypapa added he coming up to the bedside and whisperingyet with a hurried and passionate accent get well do but get well and we will be so happy never wasthere a family so happy or so loving as we will be iwhile he spoke thus i endeavoured to put out my handbut i could not i endeavoured to smile but i was unable my heart was in a feeble yet soothing tranquillity theaccents of love i had heard dwelt upon my memory theyhad talked of distress but the sentiment of love was uppermostin my recollection i was too weak of frame to sufferintellectual distress no accents but those which carriedbalm to my spirit seemed capable of resting upon my earfrom this hour i regularly grew better and as i recoveredseemed to feel more and more vividly how enviableit was to be the head of a loving and harmoniousfamilymy recovery however was exceedingly slow and it wasseveral weeks before i had so far recruited my strength asto be capable of my ordinary occupations in the meantimethe pecuniary difficulties to which we were exposedhourly increased and the cheerful but insignificant laboursof charles could contribute little to the support of a familythe melancholy nature of our situation might perhapshave been expected to prevent the restoration of my healthat first however it had not that effect the debilitatedstate of my animal functions led me by a sort of irresisu travels op st leonable instinct to reject ideas and reflections which i thouthen have been unable to endure i saw the anxiety andaffection of my family and i was comforted i saw thesmiles of marguerite and i seemed insensible to the languorthe saddened cheerfulness they expressed i did notperceive that while i was provided with every thing necessaryin my condition my family were in want of the verybread that should sustain existencemy health in the mean time improved and my perceptionsbecame proportionably clearer symptoms of desolationand famine though as much as possible covered frommy sight obtruded themselves and were remarked oneday in particular i observed various tokens of this nature insilence and with that sort of bewildered understandingwhich at once labours for comprehension and resists beliefthe day closed and what i had perceived pressed upon mymind and excluded sleep now for the first time i exertedmyself to recollect in a methodical way the state ofmy affairs for the severity of my illness had at lengthsucceeded to banish from me all ideas and feelings but whatrelated to the sensations it produced and to the objectsaround me and it was not without effort that i could oncemore fully call to mind the scenes in which i had beenengaged the truth then by regular degrees rose completelyto view and i began to be astonished that my poorwife and children had been able in any manner to getthrough the horrible evils to which they must have beenexposed this thought i revolved in my mind for neartwo hours and the longer i dwelt upon it the more perturbedand restless i grew at length it became impossiblefor me to hold my contemplations pent up in my own bosomi turned to marguerite and asked her whether shewere asleepshe answered in the negative she had been remarkingmy restlessness and tenderly enquired respecting itscausehow long said i is it since i was taken with thefever a month tomorrow replied she it was of themost malignant and distressing kind while it lasted andtravels of st leon i did not expect you to live but ithas left you a fortnight and i hope reginald you find yourself gettingstrong again and so we are here in constance and we have leftswitzerland three months my love i remember very well the letter we received from monsieurgrimseld has any further intelligence reached us fromthat quarter nonenone no supply of any kind has reached you my dear reginald talk of something else you willsoon i hope be well our children are all alive and thecalamity that has not succeeded to separate us or to diminishour circle of love even by a single member we willlearn to bear let us fix our attention on the better prospectsthat open before us stay marguerite i have other questions to ask beforeyou require me to bear the calamities that have overtakenus let me understand what these calamities arewhile we waited for intelligence from switzerland we expendedthe whole sum that we brought with us and i wasobliged to hire myself to the episcopal gardener for bread was it not so indeed reginald you are to blame pray questionme no further f this was our condition some time ago and now foramonth past i have been incapable of labour margueritewhat have you done indeed my love i have been too anxious for you tothink much of any thing else we had still some thingsyou know that we could contrive to do without and thosei have sold charles too our excellenthearted son haslately hired himself to the gardener and has every nightbrought us home a little though it was but little i am sorry you must wait butyou must learn to have patiencedo you know papa i walked in the garden beforebreakfast and so not thinking of any thing i came tothe summerhouse and i tried to open the door but icould not j found it was locked so i thought juliawas there and i knocked and called julia but nobodyanswered so then i knew julia was not there for i wassure she would have opened the door so i climbed uponthe stump of the peartree and tried to look in at the window but the shutters were shut and i could not get to seeover the top of them and i walked all round the summerhouseand all the shutters were shut papa i wishyou would not let a man get into the summerhouse who travels of st leonshuts all the shutters and locks the door you alwaysused to let me go into every room i liked and do youknow i think none but bad people lock and bolt themselvesup so it puts mind of the giants with their drawbridgesand their pitfalls i shall be quite afraid of this frightful oldmanthis prattle of the child was nothing yet it increasedthe embarrassment of my situation and made the peculiarityof the case more conspicuous finding her pertinaciousin insisting upon a topic that was disagreeable tomeher mother called her from me and put her upon someoccupation that served to divert her attention i felt likea person that was guilty of some crime and this considerationand kindness of my wife when i seemed to myself todeserve her reproach had not the power to calm myuneasinessthese little occurrences appeared like the beginning ofa separation of interests and estrangement of hearts itasked myself severely i summoned the whole force ofmy mind that i might strictly consider what it was inwhich i was about to engage if this slight and casualhint of a secret is felt by both marguerite and myself withso much uneasiness and embarrassment what will be oursituation if i go on to accept the stranger's confidence andbecome the depository of an arcanum so important as herepresents his to be he declares himself able to bestowupon me the highest opulence what will be the feelings ofmy wife and children when they see my condition suddenlychanged from its present humble appearance to splendourand wealth without being able to assign the source of thisextraordinary accession it is difficult to conceive a family picture more enviablethat than to which i was now continually present and ofwhich i formed a part we had been happy on the banksof the garonne and we had pictured to ourselves a plan ofhappiness immediately on our arrival in the city of constancebut these were little and imperfect compared withwhat i now enjoyed in the first situation my childrenwere infants and in the second the eldest was but ten

understanding was matured her judgment decidedher experience more comprehensive as she had agreater compass of materials to work upon her fancy wasmore playful her conversation richer and her reflectionsmore amusing and profound the matron character shehad acquired had had no other effect on her feelings thanto render them more deep more true and magnetical herdisposition was more entirely affectionate than it had beeneven in the first year of our cohabitation her attachmentto her children was exemplary and her vigilance uninterrupted and for myself she was accustomed in all thatrelated to our mutual love to enter into my sentiments andinclinations with so just a tone of equality and kindnessthat we seemed to be two bodies animated by a single soulif the mother were improved the children were still moreimproved in their early years we are attached to our offspringmerely because they are ours and in a way that hasled superficial speculators to consider the attachment less

they were assembled idwell upon the image with fond affection and lingering delightwhere are they now how has all this happinessbeen maliciously undermined and irrevocably destroyed to look back on it it seems like the idle fabric of a dreami awake and find myself alone were there really suchtravels of st leon persons where are they dispersed whither are theygone oh miserable solitude and desertion to which ihave so long been condemned i see nothing around mebut speechless walls or human faces that say as little to myheart as the walls themselves how palsied is my soul how withered my affections but i will not anticipatechapter xiii carried food to the stranger as occasion required in thecourse of the day he seemed indisposed to speak and weexchanged scarcely more than two or three words thenext morning was the implied time to which the questionof his confidence was deferred and i went to him with thefull resolution of refusing it whether it were that hediscerned this resolution in my countenance or that in theinterval that elapsed he had formed a meaner opinion ofmy character and thought me unfit for the purposes he intendedi should answer certain it is that he anticipated meat the same time he magnified the importance of the giftshe had to communicate he expressed himself astonishedat the precipitateness of his yesterday's conduct it wasnot till after much trial and long probation that he couldchoose himself a confidant i was not at present fit for thecharacter nor perhaps ever should be the talent he possessedwas one upon which the fate of nations and of thehuman species might be made to depend god had givenit for the best and highest purposes and the vessel inwhich it was deposited must be purified from the alloy ofhuman frailty it might be abused and applied

not yet purged ofimbecility and weakness though you have passed throughmuch and had considerable experience you are yet a childi had heard your history and expected to find you a differentman go and learn to know yourself for what you arefrivolous and insignificant worthy to have been born apeasant and not fitted to adorn the rolls of chivalry or therank to which you were destined there was something so impressive in the rebuke andcontempt of this venerable sage that made it impossible tocontend with them never was there a man more singularand in whom were united greater apparent contradictionsobserve him in a quiet and unanimated moment you mightalmost take him for a common beggar a poor miserablewretch in whom life lingered and insensate stupidityreigned but when his soul was touched in any of thosepoints on which it was most alive he rose at once and appeareda giant his voice was the voice of thunder androlling in a rich and sublime swell it arrested and stilledwhile it withered all the nerves of the soul his eyebeamsat upon your countenance and seemed to look through youyou wished to escape from its penetrating power but youhad not the strength to move i began to feel as if it weresome mysterious and superior being in human form andnot a mortal with whom i was concernedwhat a strange and contradictory being is man i hadgone to the summerhouse this morning with a firm resolutionto refuse the gifts and the communication of thestranger i felt as if lightened from a burthen which thewhole preceding day had oppressed me while i formed thisresolution i was cheerful and conscious of rectitude andstrength of mind how cheaply we prize a gift which weimagine to be already in our power with what philosophicalindifference do we turn it on every side depreciateits worth magnify its disadvantages and then pique ourselvesupon the sobriety and justice of the estimate we havemade thus it was with me in the present transaction but when i had received the check of the stranger andsaw the proposed benefit removed to a vast and uncertaindistance then it resumed all its charms then the contrasttravels of st leon of wealth and poverty flashed full upon my soul beforei had questioned the reality of the stranger's pretensionsand considered whether he might not be an artful impostorbut now all was clearness and certainty the advantages ofwealth passed in full review before my roused imaginationi saw horses palaces and their furniture i saw the splendourof exhibition and the trains of attendants objectswhich had been for ever dear to my puerile imagination icontemplated the honour love obedience troops of friendswhich are so apt to attend upon wealth when disbursedwith a moderate degree of dignity and munificence wheni compared this with my present poverty and desertion themeanness of our appearance our daily labours the dangerthat an untoward accident might sink us in the deepest distressand the hopelessness that my son or his posterityshould ever rise to that honour and distinction to which theyhad once been destined the effect was too powerfulanother feeling came still further in aid of this it wasthe humiliating impression which the stranger had left uponmy mind this seemed to be his great art if in reality hisconduct is to be imputed to art there is no enemy tovirtue so fatal as a sense of degradation selfapplause isour principal support in every liberal and elevated act ofvirtue if this ally can be turned against us if we can bemade to ascribe baseness effeminacy want of spirit andadventure to our virtuous resolutions we shall then indeedfeel ourselves shaken this was precisely my situation the figure i made in my own eyes was mean i was impatientof my degradation i believed that i had shownmyself uxorious and effeminate at a time that must haveroused in me the spirit of a man if there had been a sparkof manly spirit latent in my breast this impatience cooperatedwith the temptations of the stranger and made meanxious to possess what he offered to my acceptancei reasoned thus with myself what excites my scruples issimply the idea of having one single secret from my wifeand family this scruple is created by the singular andunprecedented confidence in which we have been accustomedto live other men have their secrets nor do theyfind their domestic tranquillity broken by that circumstance travels of st leonthe merchant does not call his wife into consultation uponhis ventures the statesman does not unfold to her his policyand his projects the warrior does not take her advice uponthe plan of his campaign the poet does not concert withher his flights and his episodes to other men the domesticscene is the relaxation of their cares when they enter itthey dismiss the business of the day and call another causei only have concentrated in it the whole of my existenceby this means i have extinguished in myself the true energyof the human character a man can never be respectablein the eyes of the world or in his own except so far as hestands by himself and is truly independent he may havefriends he may have domestic connections but he mustnot in these connections lose his individuality nothingtruly great was ever achieved that was not executed orplanned in solitary seclusionbut if these reasons are sufficient to prove that the plani have lately pursued is fundamentally wrong how muchmore will the importance of what is proposed by the strangerplead my excuse for deviating from it how bitterly havei lamented the degradation of my family shall i notseize this opportunity of reinstalling them in their hereditaryhonours i deemed the ruin i had brought uponthem irreparable shall i not embrace the occasion ofatoning for my fault no man despises wealth who fullyunderstands the advantages it confers does it not confer themeans of cultivating our powers does it not open to usthe career of honour which is shut against the unknownand obscure does it not conciliate the prepossessions ofmankind and gain for us an indulgent and liberal construction does it not inspire us with graceful confidenceand animate us to generous adventure the poor man isdenied every advantage of education and wears out his lifein labour and ignorance from offices of trust from opportunitiesof distinction he is ignominiously thrust aside and though he should sacrifice his life for the public causehe dies unhonoured and unknown if by any accident hecomes into possession of those qualities which when discernedand acknowledged command the applause of mankindwho will listen to him his appearance is mean travels of st leon and the fastidious auditor turns from him ere half his wordsare uttered he has no equipage and attendants no oneto blow the trumpet before him and proclaim his rank how can he propose any thing that shall be worthy of attention aware of the prepossession of mankind in thisrespect he is alarmed and overwhelmed with confusionbefore he opens his lips filled with the conscience of hisworth he anticipates the unmerited contempt that is preparedto oppress him and his very heart dies within himadd to these circumstances the constitution of our naturethe various pleasures of which it is adapted to partake andhow many of these pleasures it is in the power of wealth toprocure yes an object like this will sufficiently apologise formeto those for whose sake alone it was estimable in my sightit is indeed nothing but our poverty and the lowness ofour station that have thus produced in us an habitual andunreserved communication of sentiments wealth wouldto a certain degree destroy our contact and take off thewonder that we had each our thoughts that were not putinto the common stockthese considerations decided my choice i was not indeedwithout some variations of mind and some compunctionof heart for the resolution i had espoused the longerthe stranger remained with me the more evident it wasthat there was something mysterious between us and theunreserved affection and union that had lately reigned undermy roof suffered materially the effects of it the strangerhad been led to my cottage in the first instance by the entiresolitude in which it was placed there was nothingabout which he was so solicitous as concealment the mostatrocious criminal could not be more alarmed at the idea ofbeing discovered i was unable to account for this but i wasnow too anxious for his stay and the promised reward notto be alert in gratifying all his wishes the most inviolablesecresy therefore was enjoined to the whole family andthe younger branches of it particularly the little margueriteit was necessary to keep almost immured to prevent thedanger of their reporting any thing out of the house thatmight be displeasing to the stranger and fatal to my expectationsupon the whole my situation was eminently travels op st leonan uneasy one no experiment can be more precarious thanthat of a halfconfidence and nothing but the sincere affectionthat was entertained for me could have rendered itsuccessful in this instance my family felt that they weretrusted by me only in points where it was impossible toavoid it and that i was not therefore properly entitled totheir cooperation i was conscious of ingratitude inmaking them no return for their fidelity they kept mysecret because they were solicitous to oblige me not fromany conviction that they were conferring on me a benefit but on the contrary suspecting that the object as to whichthey were blindly assisting me would prove injurious tomeas well as to themselvesthe health of the stranger visibly declined but this wasa circumstance which he evidently regarded with complacencyit was the only source of consolation of which heappeared susceptible his mind was torn with painful remembrancesand agitated with terrible forebodings heabhorred solitude and yet found no consolation in societyi could not be much with him my duty to my familywho were principally supported by my labour was a calltoo imperious to be neglected even when i was with himhe commonly testified no desire for conversation staywith me he was accustomed to say give me as much ofyour time as you can but do not talk upon these occasionshe would sit sometimes with his arms folded andwith the most melancholy expression imaginable he wouldthen knit his brows wring his hands with a sadness thatmight have excited pity in the hardest breast or with bothhands closed the one clasping the other strike himself impatientlyon the forehead at other times he would risefrom his seat pace the room with hurried and unquietsteps and then again throw himself on his couch in thegreatest agitation his features were often convulsed withagony often have i wiped away the sweat which wouldsuddenly burst out in large drops on his forehead atthose seasons he would continually mutter words to himselfthe sense of which it was impossible for me to collect icould perceive however that he often repeated the namesof clara henry a wife a friend a friend travels of st leonand then he would groan as if his heart were burstingsometimes in the midst of these recollections he wouldpass the back of his hand over his eyes and then lookingat it shaking his head and biting his under lip exclaimwith a piteous accent dry dry all the moisture ofmy frame is perished then as if recovering himself hewould cry with a startled and terrified voice who is therest leon come to me let me feel that there is ahuman being near me i often call for you but i findmyself alone deserted friendless friendless at times when his recollection was more complete hewould say i know i tire you why should i tire you what gratification can it be to me to occasion emotions ofdisgust upon these occasions i endeavoured to soothehim and assured him i found pleasure in administering tohis relief but he replied no no do not flatter me it is long since i have heard the voice of flattery i neverloved it no i know i am precluded from ever excitingfriendship or sympathy why am i hot dead why do ilive a burthen to myself useful to none my secret icould almost resolve should die with me but you haveearned and you shall receive itthe stranger was not always in this state of extreme anguishnor always indisposed to converse he had lucidintervals and could beguile the sorrow of his heart withsocial communication we sometimes talked of varioussciences and branches of learning he appeared to be wellinformed in them all his observations were ingenious his language copious his illustrations fanciful and picturesque his manner bold and penetrating it was easyto observe in him the marks of a vigorous and masculinegenius sometimes we discussed the events at that timegoing on in the world when we discoursed of events thathad passed and persons that had died more than a centurybefore the stranger often spoke of them in a manner as ifhe had been an eyewitness and directly acquainted withthe objects of our discourse this i ascribed to the vividnessof his conceptions and the animation of his languagehe however often checked himself in this peculiarity andalways carefully avoided what could lead to any thing per travels op st leonsonal to himself i described to him the scenes of my youthand related my subsequent history he on his part wasinvincibly silent on every circumstance of his country hisfamily and his adventuresthe longer i was acquainted with him the more my curiositygrew i was restless and impatient to learn somethingrespecting a man who thus wrapped himself up inmystery and reserve often i threw out as it were a lineby which to fathom his secret i talked of various countriesi mentioned different kinds of calamities and even of crimesthat by some incidental allusion i might discover at unawareshis country his connections or the nature of hisstory when any thing that offered seemed to lead to thedesired point i doubled my questions and endeavoured toconstruct them with the skill of a crafty litigant in a courtof justice there were some subjects the very mention ofwhich gave him uneasiness and upon which he immediatelysilenced me but these were not of themselves enough toafford me a clue or to furnish materials out of which formeto construct the history of the stranger he did notalways perceive the drift of my questions and snares butashen he did he generally became loud resentful andfurious there was nothing else that so completely rousedhis indignationst leon said he to me one day silence this inquisitivetemper of yours check your rash and rude

have very probably conjectured that in mycase it arises from the same source if you have i forgiveyou but i assure you that you are mistaken take fromyourself that uneasiness if it has ever visited you youare not giving sanctuary to a villain i am innocent ican take no crime to my charge i have suffered morealmost than man ever suffered but i have sinned littlethe cause of my uneasiness and prime source of all mymisfortunes i dare not disclose to you be contented withthe plan of my conduct i have digested my purpose ihave determined where to speak and where to be silentthe more i saw of this man the more strange and unaccountableappeared to me every thing that related to himwhy was he so poor possessing as he pretended inexhaustiblewealth why was he unhappy with so greattalents and genius and such various information whywas he friendless being as he solemnly assured me so perfectlyinnocent and of consequence so respectable thathe was an impostor every thing that i saw of him forbademe to believe his sorrows were too profound and excruciatingfor it to be possible for me to rank them amongthe actions that a man may play the greatness of hispowers the dignity of his carriage the irresistible appearanceof sincerity that sparkled in his eye and modulatedhis voice fully convinced me that he really was what hepretended to be i had heard of men who under the presttravels op st leonhence of alchemy fastened themselves upon persons possessingsums of money and beguiling them with a delusiveexpectation of wealth reduced them to beggary and ruinone such person i had had a brief connection with duringmy residence in the bordelois though finding the incidentby no means essential to the progress of my history i havepassed it over together with many others in silence butnothing could be more unlike than that man and the personrespecting whom i was now concerned in reality i possessedat that time if i may be allowed to say so a morethan common insight into the characters of mankind so asto be little likely except under the tyranny of passion asin the instance of gaming to be made the prey of impositioni had studied my species as it exhibits itself in historyand had mixed with it in various scenes and underdissimilar aspects i had accordingly in the transaction ihave just alluded to soon detected the plans of the villainwho expected to delude me but what could be the purposeof the stranger in this respect the pretended alchemistin france had obtained a certain sum of money of meand demanded more the stranger never made such a demandof me and perfectly knew that even if i had beeninclined i was not able to supply him the alchemisthad amused me with descriptions of various processes forthe transmutation of metals had exhibited his crucibles andretorts and employed a sort of dramatic coup d'aeil for thepurpose of awakening my curiosity and stimulating mypassions the stranger had simply stated in the plainestand most direct manner that it was in his power to enrichme but had been silent as to the manner of producing thewealth he promised and had abstained from every effort tointoxicate my mind i felt therefore in this instance theeffect that without being able to solve the difficulties andcontrarieties that hung about him i yet believed his assertions nor was the inscrutability of his history and his motivescapable of shaking my confidenceone day during the period of his concealment certainofficers of the bishop of constance accompanied by a foreignerin a neapolitan habit came to my house and asit proved with the express purpose of searching for thetravels of st leon man who had put himself under my protection charlesand myself were at work in the fields within sight of thelake their appearance first caught the attention of charlesas they approached the shore and he enquired of me respectingthe habit of the foreigner which was different fromany he had been accustomed to see while we were yetspeaking i observed in them an intention to land withinsight of my cottage this was an uncommon circumstanceour privacy was rarely invaded and we lived almost asmuch out of the world as we should have done in the remotestisland of the atlantic ocean i reasoned in my ownmind upon their appearance they had little resemblance toa party of pleasure the habit of the officers of justice iwas perfectly acquainted with and the suspicion of the realnature of their errand immediately darted on my thoughtswithout saying a word to charles on the subject i hastenedwith all the speed i could exert to the apartment of thestranger and acquainted him with what i had seen heconcurred with me in the ideas i had formed and appearedmuch shocked at the intelligence there was howeverno time to be lost and after having for a moment givenvent to an anguish which was too powerful to be suppressedhe withdrew as hastily as he could from the summerhouseand betook himself to the woods he recommended to meto leave him telling me that he could conceal himself mosteffectually alone and observing that it would be necessaryfor me to meet the officers and endeavour as much as possibleto remove their suspicionsaccordingly as soon as he was gone i threw open thewindows of the summerhouse removed the shutters andtook from it as effectually as i could all appearance ofhaving served as a place of concealment this was a precautionwhich the stranger had on a former occasion recommendedto me it fortunately happened that julia andthe little marguerite were gone out together in the fields onthe eastern side of my cottage otherwise infallibly the childfoy her innocent prattle and perhaps julia by the apprehensivesensibility of her temper would have betrayed oursecret or at least have suggested to the officers a feeling asif by a longer stay and a more diligent search they mightl travels of st leonpossibly succeed in the object of their expedition as itwas i received them at the door and learned from theirown mouths the nature of their errand of charles whomthey had crossed in the fields they had simply asked whetherthey were right as to the name of the person who was proprietorof the cottage before them they described to mewith great accuracy the appearance of the stranger and insistedthat he had been an inhabitant of my cottage theytold me they were well informed that the summerhousein my garden had carefully been shut up for more than amonth past and that some person had been concealed therei was interested in the distress of the stranger i was impressedwith the dignity of his character i implicitly confidedin his assertions of innocence and the unjust persecutionthat he suffered i was not insensible to the proposedreward the realising of which probably depended on hissafety but most of all i considered my honour as pledgedfor the protection of the man who had thus cast himselfupon my fidelity and believed that i should be everlastinglydisgraced if he suffered any evil through treachery or neglecton my part i therefore answered confidently tothe officers that they were misinformed and offered to conductthem over every part of my house and demesnes thatthey might satisfy themselves by inspection that there wasno person concealed any where within my possessions ishould have been better pleased openly to have defied theirinterrogatories and to have asked them whether allowingtheir suspicions to be just they were entitled to believe thati was such a villain as to betray a man who had thrownhimself upon my generosity but though this conductwould have had a greater appearance of gallantry i believedit would have less of the reality as it would have strengthenedtheir idea of my participation and increased the dangerof the person i was bound to protectthey accepted my offer of submitting to their searchand made a strict examination of every place about my habitationin which the stranger could be concealed disappointedhere they endeavoured by threats to discoverwhether i was able to give them any information to thesei calmly answered that they had mistaken my character travels of st leon that though i was a poor man i had not forgotten that iwas noble that they were already in possession of my spontaneousanswer to their enquiries and that in no case andupon no supposition should tyranny and ill treatment extortfrom me what i was not in the first instance disposedto give my wife was present during this conversation andi could perceive felt an alarm for my danger that she wouldhave been incapable of feeling for a danger to herselfthough i was extremely anxious that these men shouldbe disappointed in the object of their expedition yet i didnot neglect this opportunity of endeavouring to obtain satisfactionfor my own curiosity i remarked at first that theneapolitan was an inquisitor and this circumstance hadgiven additional poignancy to the uneasiness of margueritebut the accusations of which the inquisition at this timetook cognisance were so numerous the ecclesiastical powercontinually usurping upon the civil that i was little assistedin the judgment i was desirous to frame by any inference tobe deduced from this circumstance i questioned directlywith an air as if it were merely in the way of conversationwhat was the crime of the man of whom they were in pursuitand what was the cause forcible enough to induce aneapolitan inquisitor to follow so decrepit and forlorn anindividual as he described beyond the alps and almost tothe banks of the danube to this he answered roughlythat though he was not able to discover the object of hissearch he was by no means convinced that i was not hisabettor and accomplice and that as to his crime that wasnot to be named the welfare of christendom demandingthat the criminal and the memory of his offences shouldbe buried together at the same time he warned me toconsider well what i did before i exposed myself to fceoverwhelmed by the vengeance of the court of which hewas a member to this i answered haughtily that i hadalready condescended to repel his suspicion and that noother man than an inquisitor would have had the stupidityor the audaciousness to question my veracity i addedthat i was perfectly acquainted with the nature of his courtwhich was an object of abhorrence to the whole christianworld but that he was mistaken if he supposed that thel travels of st leondetestable nature of its proceedings would enable him topractise every sort of outrage with impunity the officerswithdrew into the little inclosure in front of my cottageand i overheard them consulting whether having failed intheir principal object they should carry me a prisoneralong with them the firmness of my manner howeverhad awed them and the fearlessness i expressed seemed tothem to arise from a consciousness of innocence they atlength departed as they camei watched them from my cottage as they descended tothe shore and it was with no little pleasure that i perceivedthem reembark and stand off for the opposite side of thelake this spectacle for a time entirely engaged me andwhen i turned from the door i observed that my belovedmarguerite had been in tears she endeavoured to hidethis circumstance from my sight i took her affectionatelyby the hand and pressing her to my bosom entreated hernot to make herself uneasyah reginald said she how can i avoid being uneasywhen i see you exposed to this imminent danger ithought that in forfeiting our fortune and our rank andretiring to this obscure and sequestered situation we mightat least promise ourselves the blessing of the poor oblivionand security and that should have consoled me for all ihave lost who is this man that is thus mysteriously hiddenamong us what is the guilt from the punishment ofwhich he thus anxiously withdraws himself what canbe the nature of your connection with such a man andwhat will be the issue of so perilous an adventure i hesitated i knew not what to answer to so earnestan anxiety i was melted at the distress and the affectionof marguerite she saw my embarrassment and proceededmistake me not my beloved said she i have nodesire to pry into what you are willing to conceal forgivethe perturbation which has poured itself out in these involuntaryquestions i repose an entire confidence in youi would sooner die than interfere with any object you haveat heart go on according to the dictates of your ownjudgment undisturbed by me i will not doubt that youtravels op st leon have sufficient reasons for what you communicate and whatyou suppress i am grieved indeed at the interruption ofour obscure and unambitious tranquillity but i had resolvednot to trouble you with my uneasiness and apprehensionsthe incident of this morning has extorted them from me but i will behave better in futurethis scene was extremely distressing to me my wifewas oppressed with fears and i had nothing to answer herthe consolations that rose up in my own mind i was preventedfrom communicating the more generously sheconfided in me the more i felt the ungracious and disagreeablenature of the concealment i practised i endeavouredhowever to encourage myself with the idea that the labourwould not be long and the harvest would prove abundanti said in my own mind the worst is now over the businesshas been commenced the shock to my own familyhas actually occurred i must go on resolutely and shutmy eyes to the temporarily displeasing circumstances thatmay be connected with the completing my objectchapter xiiianother source of uneasiness was added to the distractionmy mind already endured the stranger did not appearit was in the morning that the officers of justice arrivedthey departed about noon and in two hours afterwards ientered the wood in search of my guest the wood wasof some leagues in extent it was intersected by paths invarious directions it was interspersed with caverns j itsgrowth was of all kinds in some places lofty trees thatseemed to form a support for the clouds in others an underwoodimpenetrable alike to the feet and to the eye asi entered the wood i however conceived that the discoveryof the stranger to me who was acquainted with its lurkingplaceswould be an affair of little toil his feebleness anddecrepitude would not suffer him to proceed to any greatdistance in this i was mistaken i looked carefully oni travels of st leonall sides i examined every recess and corner with whichi was acquainted but i found no trace of the strangerthe scene was so complicated and involved that even thiswas a labour of considerable duration at length i becamesatisfied that he was not in the nearer division of thewoodi paused i felt at once that it was little less than aherculean task to hunt through the whole of its dimensionsit would probably be of little use to call and endeavourby that means to discover his retreat i knew ofno name by which he was to be recognised and if my ownvoice was but a slight resource to penetrate this immenselabyrinth of foliage the voice of the stranger weakened byage and now probably still more enfeebled by hunger andfatigue could not be expected to make itself heard besidewhich as i knew not what the source of information hadbeen to the officers who had just left me i was unwillingto expose my guest to the danger that might arise from thismode of seeking him i could not even be sure though ihad seen their boat stand off from the shore that they mightnot afterwards land one or more of their party and be atthis very moment within earshot of me i therefore proceededin anxiety and silencemy search was no more successful in the part of thewood with which i was little acquainted than in the partwith which i was most familiar i had already been engagedfour hours in the task and night began to come onit shut in with heavy clouds that on all sides appeareddeeply loaded with rain i now began to consider my ownsituation and by comparing circumstances found that iwas at a great distance from my own habitation therewas no direct path by which for me to return i had proceededto the right and the left backward and forwardsometimes by more open paths and sometimes forcing myway through briars and brushwood as caprice or the hopeof effecting the object of my search happened to guide meit was therefore no easy matter to guess how i was toreturn or even now that the lowering clouds had coveredthe horizon with one uniform tint in which direction laythe cottage or the lake while i stood contemplating whattravels of st leon was to be done i heard the howling of the wolves at a distance and their howl had that particular melancholy anddiscomfiting sound which is well known to precede a comingstorm there was no time to be lost and accordinglyi set out i was less anxious to be at home on my ownaccount than for the sake of quieting the alarms of myfamily to whom i had already occasioned too great a portionof uneasinessi had not proceeded far before the rain descended intorrents intermingled with peals of thunder and sheets oflightning the thunder interrupted as it were from timeto time with the noise of the wild beasts that inhabited thewood deafened me while the excessive and instantaneousbrilliancy of the lightning occasioned me an intolerableaching in the organ of sight it rained incessantly for twohours and i found myself drenched and fatigued with thewet during this time my progress was small and i wasever and anon intercepted by the underwood and could notwithout repeated experiments discover the means of proceedingat length the rain subsided and seemed to giveplace to a gloomy and motionless calm soon after i discovereda light at a distance and advanced towards it asi approached i perceived that it proceeded from a set ofbanditti to the amount of fourteen or fifteen persons sittinground a fire in the mouth of a cavern i was glad to turnmy steps another way and was for some time afraid thatthe noise i made in occasionally forcing my way throughthe bushes would alarm them and cost me my life ihowever fortunately escaped their notice this was in apart of the wood remote from the path i ought to havetaken and near the road to lindathe day began to dawn before i reached my own habitationthe conjecture i had made when i was unawaresupon the point of falling into the hands of the bandittithat the road of linda was on the other side of their retreatwas of some service to me as an indication where tofind the cottage and the lake this road skirted the woodon the side nearly opposite to that by which i entered itthe difficulties however i had to encounter were inconceivablygreat in endeavouring to preserve my line of directionl travels op st leonafter having been compelled four or five times to deviatefrom the line it is seldom that a traveller will find himselfright in his conjecture as to the direction he is pursuingunless he has some sensible object as a sort of polestar bywhich to govern his route it happened in this instancethat i was more fortunate than i was entitled to expect ilaboured indeed till daybreak without getting out of thelabyrinth that inclosed me but the sun no sooner beganto lend an imperfect light than i recognised certain objectswhich upon some former occasions i had observed andperceived that my journey was nearly at an end i enteredmy cottage and found marguerite alone awake and expectingmeshe had been somewhat uneasy on account of my absenceboth from the extreme tempestuousness of the nightand in consequence of the painful sensations the events ofthe preceding morning had introducedevents with whichit was almost unavoidable for her to imagine that my absencewas in some way connected the period of my insanityin switzerland might indeed have accustomed herto the irregularity of my motions but a term of more thansix years which had intervened had produced in her expectationsand habits of a different sort i related to thisadmirable woman the adventures of the night and the fruitlessnessof the search in which i had been engaged andthis openness of communication resembling the natureof the intercourse which had lately existed between us relievedin some degree my burthened heart and cheered thedrooping spirits of marguerite she dropped some consolatoryand sadly pleasing tears and her manner seemed tosay though she would not suffer her tongue to give the ideawords how sweet are cordiality and confidence oh donot let our situation which has deprived us of many othercomforts ever again be robbed of this comfort which isalone worth all the rest though she necessarily felt thepresence of the stranger as an evil the bane of our domesticpeace yet it was impossible for her not to compassionatehis fate and suffer some distress from his strange andabrupt disappearanceafter the conversation which had so eminently served astravels of st leon a relief to our minds marguerite left me to repose myselffrom the extraordinary fatigue i had undergone but myttind was too much disturbed to suffer me to sink into thearms of forgetfulness i felt something tragical in the saddestiny of my unfortunate guest it was but too probablethat in his peculiarly weak state of body and with his declininghealth the being thus exposed for a day and a nightto the effects of hunger of the inclemency of the air andthe tempestuousness of the elements would put a close tohis existence i was determined soon to recommence mysearch but how could i be sure that i should be morefortunate today than the day before if i found him itwas most likely i should find him either dead or dyingthe degree of intercourse that had taken place between ushad made him occupy a considerable space in my thoughtsthe prospects he had opened to me the conduct he hadinduced me to adopt the painful effects and dissatisfactionof mind which had been produced by that conduct as itrespected my family all combined to give me an interestin his fate i had seen his talents i had felt his ascendancy had experienced that sort of conflict which appearancesof guilt on the one hand and asseverations ofinnocence on the other are calculated to produce in thethoughts and emotions of a bystander he was no commonman the expectations and conjectures he excited wereof no ordinary sort and i felt that an army might bedestroyed and a spacious plain covered with the woundedand the dying without producing greater commotion in mysoulin the anxious and disturbed state of mind in which iwas the thoughts flow with extraordinary rapidity it willbe found attended with a strange and previously to theexperiment incredible mixture of reasoning and passion ofphilosophising and fury i was accordingly conscious atthis moment of the truth of the stranger's assertion that inme he had a protector not a friend friendship is an objectof a peculiar sort the smallest reserve is deadly to iti may indeed feel the emotions of a friend towards a manwho in part conceals from me the thoughts of his heart but then i must be unconscious of this concealment the travels of st leoninstant i perceive this limitation of confidence he dropsinto the class of ordinary men a divorce is effected betweenus our hearts which grew together suffer amputation the arteries are closed the blood is no longermutually transfused and confounded i shall be consciousof all his qualities for i stand in the place of an impartialumpire i consider him as a machine capable of so muchutility to myself and so much utility to other men buti do not regard him as the brother of my soul i do notfeel that my life is bound up in his i do not feel as ifwere he to die the whole world would be at an end to meand that my happiness would be buried with him for everin the darkness of the grave i am not conscious of thoseemotions which are the most exquisite and indescribablethe human mind can experience and which being communicatedby a sort of electrical stroke to him who is theirobject constitute the solace of all his cares the alleviatorof all his calamities the only nectar and truest balm ofhuman life for me he stands alone in the world havingcompanions and associates the connections as it were ofmercantile selfishness or casual jollity and good humourbut no friend it was thus that i thought of the strangerhe obtained from me the compassion due to a human beingand the respect extorted by his qualities but nothing calculatedradically to disturb the equilibrium of the mind ilooked forward to his death with unruffled thoughts and anmoistened eye there was one thing indeed that shookme more deeply the thought of losing the promised rewardand of having exposed myself to the evil of an unquiet anddissatisfied mind in vaini rested but a few hours before i set out again upon thesearch to which the interposition of the darkness of thepreceding night had put an abrupt close i had the precautionto take with me a slight provision of food and cordialsbelieving that if i found the stranger he would atleast be in the greatest need of something reviving and restorativecharles earnestly intreated to assist me in thesearch but upon this i put a peremptory prohibition itwould have been in direct contradiction to what the strangerhad most solemnly required of metravels of st leon i had already spent several hours in anxiously tracingthe wood in every direction and the period of noon waspast when approaching an obscure and almost impenetrablethicket my ear was caught by a low and melancholy soundwhich at first i knew not to what i was to ascribe ithowever arrested my attention and caused me to assumean attitude of listening after the lapse of little more thanaminute the same sound was repeated i now distinctlyperceived that it was the groan of some creature in a veryfeeble and exhausted state and immediately suspected thatit was the stranger i went almost round the thicket beforei could discern an entrance and though i looked with theutmost care could perceive nothing that the thicket inclosedthe groan was repeated a third time the long intervalsbetween the groans gave a peculiar melancholy to the effectand each seemed so much lower than the groan before thatnothing but the ear of anxious attention would have caughtit at the same time that the tone conveyed an idea of stupefiedyet vital anguish at length i perceived the legsand something of the garb of a man it was the stranger he appeared to have crept into the thicket upon his handsand knees when i forced my way to him he seemed inthe very act of expiring he was lying on his face and iraised him a little his eyes were fixed his mouth wasopen his lips and tongue were parched and dry i infuseda few drops of a cordial into his mouth for a momentit appeared to produce no sensation but presently mypatient uttered a deep and longdrawn sigh i repeated myapplication as a principal cause of the condition in whichi found him was inanition the stimulant i administeredproduced a powerful effect he moved his hands shudderedturned his eyes languidly upon me and having appearedto recognise me shut them hastily again i movedhim slowly and softly into a freer air and bathed his templeswith one of the liquids i had about me by this time helooked up and then suddenly round him with a wild andhurried air he spoke not however he was speechlessin about a quarter of an hour he relapsed into convulsionsin which it seemed probable he would expire they lasteda considerable time and he then sunk into a state of ingenstravels of st leonnobility i thought he was dead thus circumstanced itwas some relief to my humanity to have found him yetalive and to have received his parting breath but in amoment his secret and his promises recurred to me withinexpressible anguish and i inwardly reproached him forhaving deferred his communication so long as now to precludeits ever being made i cannot describe the keennessthe burning and intolerable bitterness of my sensationkeen it may well be supposed to have been from its havingso instantaneously and forcibly recurred at a time whenother objects seemed to press upon my senses no onewho has not felt what it is to fall in a moment from hopeor as i should rather say from assured possession of whathis soul most loved and desired into black and interminabledespair can imagine what was then the state of my mindthe body of my patient sliced from my nerveless arms ilifted up the eyes of rage and phrensy as if to curse the authorof my being and then fell helpless and immoveableby the side of the strangeri felt him move i heard him sigh i lifted up myhead and perceived stronger marks of life and sense abouthim than had yet displayed themselves i threw my armsabout him i pressed him to my heart the emphaticallygesture i used seemed to have a sort of magnetical force torouse his dying powers with a little assistance from mehe sat upright my assiduity produced wonders it fortunatelyhappened that this thicket was but a half a milefrom my habitation and indeed was one of the spotswhich i had searched without success the day beforeabout the hour of sunset partly by leading and partlyby supporting him i restored my guest to his former apartmenthe remained speechless or nearly so he vented hissensations in sighs in inward and inarticulate sounds andeven when he arrived at the power of making himself understoodby words it was only by monosyllables and halfsentences that he conveyed to me his meaning i now gaveup my time almost entirely to an assiduous attendance onthe stranger every day i expected to be his last everydaywas more or less interspersed with symptoms thattravels of st leon seemed to menace his instant dissolution during all thistime i remained in the anxious suspense of contending hopeand fear was it probable that he would ever recoverstrength enough to confer on me the legacy he had announced the particulars of his secret i knew not butjudging from what i had heard of the pretences and pursuitsof alchemy it was natural to suppose that he had aprocess to communicate which would require on his partconsiderable accuracy of recollection as well as the powerof delivering himself in a methodical and orderly discoursei was fortunate enough however to perceive after a tormentingand tedious crisis that he appeared to be in a progressof convalescence and that his strength both of bodyand mind were recruited daily after the lapse of a fortnightfrom the adventure of the wood he one eveningaddressed me in the following manner st leon i have been to blame i have put you to asufficient trial i have received from you every assistanceand kindness that my situation demanded i have imposedon you much trouble and anxiety i have excited yourexpectations by announcing to you in part what it was inmy power to bestow and i have finally risked the defraudingyour hopes and your humanity of their just rewarddo me the justice however to remember that i had nopresentiment of the event which has so inauspiciously comebetween you and your hopes fool that i was i imaginedi had suffered enough and that as i had obtained a longerrespite from external persecution than i almost ever experiencedi should be permitted to spend the short remainderof my days uninterrupted i now however look back uponthis last assault with complacency it has cut off somethingfrom the last remnant of a life to the close of whichi look forward with inexpressible longing at the sametime that i am still in prospect of obtaining the final wishof my heart the stealing out of the world unperceived andthus in some measure eluding the last malice of my enemiesafter my death i have but one injunction to leavewith you the injunction of hercules to philoctetes thatno inducement may move you to betray to mortal man theplace in which you shall have deposited my ashes bury travels op st leonthem in a spot which i will describe to you it is not farand is only recommended to me by its almost inaccessiblesituation and that once done speak of me and if possiblethink of me no more never on any account mention meor allude to me never describe me or relate the manner ofour meeting or the adventure which has at length broughton the desired close of my existencebelieve me in the feeble and helpless condition in whichi have spent the last fortnight your wishes and expectationshave been uppermost in my mind and there isnothing i have felt with so much compunction as the dangerof leaving them unsatisfied to you perhaps i at presentappear to be rapidly recovering i feel the dart ofdeath in my vitals i know i shall not live four days itis necessary therefore that i should finish without delay allthat remains for me to finish i will devote this night tothe arranging my thoughts and putting in order what i haveto communicate that no mistake or omission may have partin a transaction so important come to me tomorrowmorning i will be prepared for youas soon as i heard this discourse and provided the strangerwith every thing he could want during the night i withdrewmy heart was big with expectation my thoughtsall night were wild and tumultuous when the hour ofassignation arrived i hastened along the garden to thesummerhouse conscious that upon that hour depended allthe colour of my future life since the stranger had beenin his present dangerous condition the door was not boltedit was only locked the key was in my possession andremained night and day attached to my person i openedthe door i panted and was breathlessi immediately saw that the stranger had undergone somegreat alteration for the worse he had suffered a sort ofparalytic affection he lifted up his face as i entered itwas paler than i had ever seen it he shook his headmournfully and intimated by signs the disappointmentwhich this morning must witness he was speechlesste fate fate exclaimed i in an agony of despair am i tobe for ever baffled is the prize so much longed for and soardently expected at last to escape me it is not to betravels op st leon imagined how much these successive endless disappointmentsincreased my impatience and magnified in my eyesthe donation i soughtthe whole of this and the following day the strangerremained speechless the third day in the morning hemurmured many sounds but in a manner so excessivelyinarticulate that i was not able to understand one word insix that he said i recollected his prediction that he shoulddie on the fourth day the fever of my soul was at itsheight mortal sinews and fibres could sustain no moreif the stranger had died thus it is most probable that ishould have thrown myself in anguish and rage upon hiscorpse and have expired in the same hourin the evening of the third day i visited him again hehad thrown his robe around him and was sitting on the sideof his couch the evening sun shot his last beams overthe windowshutters there were about eight inches betweenthe shutter and the top of the window and somebranches of vines with their grapes already ripe broke theuniformity of the light the side of the couch faced thewest and the beams played upon the old man's countenancei had never seen it so serene the light already softenedby the decline of day gave it a peculiar animation and asmile that seemed to betoken renovation and the youth ofangels sat upon it he beckoned me to approach iplaced myself beside him on the couch he took my handin his and leaned his face towards mei shall never witness the light of the setting sunagain were the first words he uttered i immediatelyperceived that he spoke more collectedly and with betterarticulation than at any time since the paralytic strokestill however it was no easy matter to develop his wordsbut i wound up every faculty of my frame to catch them and assisted as i was by the habit of listening to hisspeech for many weeks which during the whole of thattime had never been distinct i was successful enough tomake out his entire discourseit continued though with various interruptions for morethan half an hour he explained with wonderful accuracythe whole of his secrets and the process with which they travels of st leonwere connected my soul was roused to the utmost stretchof attention and astonishment his secrets as i havealready announced in the commencement of this historyconsisted of two principal particulars the art of multiplyinggold and the power of living for ever the detail of thesesecrets i omit into that i am forbidden to enter mydesign in writing this narrative i have said is not to teachthe art of which i am in possession but to describe theadventures it produced to methe more i listened the more my astonishment grewi looked at the old man before me i observed the wretchednessof his appearance the meanness of his attire hisapparent old age his extreme feebleness the charactersof approaching death that were written on his countenanceafter what i had just heard i surveyed these things witha sensation of novelty as if i had never remarked them inhim before i said to myself is this the man that possessesmines of wealth inexhaustible and the capacity of living foreverobserving that he had finished his discourse i addressedto him these words by a sort of uncontrollable impulseand with all the vehemence of unsated and insuppressiblecuriositytell me i adjure you by the living god what usehave you made of these extraordinary gifts and with whatevents has that use been attended as i spoke thus the countenance of the old man underwenta surprising change its serenity vanished hiseyes rolled with an expression of agony and he answeredme thus be silent st leon how often must i tell you thatno single incident of my story shall ever be repeated havei no claim upon your forbearance can you be barbarousand inhuman enough to disturb my last scene with thesebitter recollections i was silentthis is all that is material that passed at our interviewthe stranger died the next day and was buried accordingto his instructionstravels op st leon llchapter xivfrom the moment of my last interview with the strangeri was another creature my thoughts incessantly rolled uponhis communications they filled me with astonishment andjoy almost to bursting i was unable to contain myself i was unable to remain in any posture or any place icould scarcely command myself sufficiently to perform thelast duties to his body in the manner he had directed ipaced with eager step the sands of the lake i climbed theneighbouring hills and then descended with inconceivablerapidity to the vales below i traced with fierce impatiencethe endless mazes of the wood in which i so hardlyrecovered my bewildered guest the uninterruptednessand celerity of bodily motion seemed to communicate someease to my swelling heartyet

trivial would appear to me thoseconcerns of a few years about which the passions of menare so eagerly occupied i did not like the deadness ofheart that seemed to threaten me i began to be afraid ofvacancy and torpor and that my life would become too uniformlyquiet nor did it sufficiently console me to recollectthat as one set of friends died off the stage anotherrace would arise to be substituted in their stead i felt thathuman affections and passions are not made of this transferablestuff and that we can love nothing truly unless wedevote ourselves to it heart and soul and our

not that i shouldfinally limit my abode to france a man who like is without end of life may well consider himselfas being also like him without father without motherand without descent but at all events i would first fixmy children who did not participate in my privileges inm travels op st leoiftheir native soil i would reside there myself at least tillthey were fully disposed of and till the

a remarkable and interesting year in thehistory of france the endless animosities of francis andthe emperor had broken out with new fury about two yearsbefore in the spring of the present year the count d'anguien had won a battle in piedmont in which ten thousandimperialists were left dead upon the field and whichmight be considered as having at length effaced the defeatof pavia in the same part of the world nineteen years beforethe moment it had been announced that a battle was resolvedon the young nobility of france with their characteristicardour had hurried to the scene and the court ofparis was in an instant as it were turned into a deserton the other hand the emperor and the king of englandhad concerted for the same season a formidable plan ofattack against our northern frontier with an army oftwentyfive thousand men respectively the one on the sideof champagne and the other of picardy they agreed toadvance directly into the heart of the kingdom and to unitetheir forces in the neighbourhood of paris the last intelligencethat iad leached me was that chateau theoryabout twenty leagues from the metropolis was in the handsof the emperor and that the inhabitants of the capitalfilled with consternation were seeking their safety by flightin every direction these circumstances had passed idlyby me and left little impression so long as i consideredmyself as an obscure peasant cut off for ever from the bosomof my country but vested with the extraordinary powersthe battle of cerisoltestravels of st leon lnow intrusted to me the case was altered i felt even agreater interest in my sovereign now pressed down withdisease and calamity yet retaining the original alacrity andconfidence of his soul than i had done when i saw him inall the pride of youth and all the splendour of prosperityi was anxious that charles should now enter into his service and i determined once again to assume the cuirassand the falchion that i might he the instructor of hisyouth and his pattern in feats of war i resolved that myshepherdboy bred in obscurity among woods and mountainsshould burst with sudden splendour upon his countrymenand prove in the field his noble blood and

wasfortunate enough to allure my stay spreading improvementsdispensing blessings and causing all distress and calamityto vanish from before mes travels op st leonchapter xvmy mind was occupied in these and similar reveries forseveral weeks after the death of the stranger my wife andchildren had hoped after that event that i should havereturned to the habits which had pervaded the last six yearsof my existence and which they had felt so eminently productiveof gratification and delight in this hope theyfound themselves deceived my domestic character wasfor the present at least wholly destroyed i had a subjectof contemplation that did not admit of a partaker and fromthis subject i could not withdraw my thoughts so much asfor an instant i had no pleasure but in that retirementwhere i could be unseen and unheard by any human eye orear if at any time i was compelled to join the domesticcircle i despatched the occasion that brought me there asspeedily as possible and even while i remained in it wassilent and absent engrossed with my own contemplationsand heedless and unobservant of every thing around memy abstraction was not however so entire as to preventme from sometimes stealing in a sort of momentary interregnumof thought in that pause where the mind restsupon the chain already passed over and seems passively towait for the sequel a glance at my family i looked atthem without knowing what it was that i did and withoutthe intention to notice what i saw yet even in this stateof mental abstraction visible objects will sometimes succeedin making their impression i perceived that my wifeand children suffered from my behaviour i remarked ageneral air of disconsolateness and a mild expostulatingsubmission to what nevertheless the heart deeply deploredthey did not presume to interrupt me they did not byprying and inquisitive speeches attempt to extort from methe secret of the alteration they saw but it was manifestthey conceived some great and radical calamity had poisonedthe heart of our domestic joyit was these symptoms thus remarked by me that firstroused me from the inebriation of my new condition itravels op st leon was compelled to suspect that while i revelled in visions offuture enjoyment i was inflicting severe and unmeritedpains on those i loved it was necessary if i valued theirhappiness that i should descend from the clouds of speculationand fancy and enter upon the world of realitiesbut here i first found a difficulty to which during thereign of my intoxication i had been utterly insensible iwas rich i could raise my family as far as the power ofmoney extended money which may in some sense be sty ledthe empress of the world to what heights i pleased ihad hitherto committed the fault so common to projectorsof looking only to ultimate objects and great resting placesand neglecting to consider the steps between this was anomission of high importance every thing in the worldis conducted by gradual process this seems to be thegreat principle of harmony in the universe nothing isabrupt one thing is so blended and softened into anotherthat it is impossible to say where the former ends and thelatter beginsthis remark is fully applicable to the situation which wasnow before me yesterday i was poor today i was possessorof treasures inexhaustible how was this alterationto be announced to dissipate the revenues of princesto purchase immense estates to launch into costly establishmentsare tasks to which the most vulgar mind is equalbut no man stands alone in the world without all trace ofwhat he has been and with no one near that thinks himselfentitled to scrutinise his proceedings and his conditionleast of all was this my case i was bound to certainother persons by the most sacred obligations i could notseparate myself from them i could not render myself amere enigma in their eyes though in the language of theworld the head of my family they were my natural censorsand judges i was accountable to them for my conduct itwas my duty paramount to all other duties to stand as afair upright and honourable character in their estimationif these remarks be true taken in a general view theyare much more so when applied to my particular casethere are men who live in the midst of their families likean eastern despot surrounded with his subjects they are travels op st leonsomething too sacred to be approached their conduct is notto be reasoned upon the amount of their receipts and disbursementsis not to be inspected their resources are unknown no one must say to them what dost thou orwhy hast thou thus conducted thyself even these personswill not escape the tax to which all men are liable theycannot kill the general spirit of enquiry the mystery inwhich they wrap themselves will often serve as an additionalstimulus they will finally encounter the judgment andverdict of all for myself i had lived in the midst of myfamily upon a system of paternal and amicable commercei had suffered too deeply from a momentary season ofseparation and mystery not to have been induced to renounceit decisively and for everfirm however as i had imagined my renunciation tohave been i was now thrown back upon what i had mostavoided i had a secret source of advantage the effects ofwhich were to be participated by those i loved while thespring was to remain for ever unknown what i mostsought upon this occasion was that my family shouldshare my good fortune and at the same time be preventedfrom so much as suspecting that there was any thing mysteriousconnected with it to effect this i presently conceivedthat it would be necessary to sacrifice the suddenand instantaneous prosperity i had proposed to myself andintroduce the reverse of our condition by slow and as faras possible insensible degreesone thing on which i determined preparatory to theother measures i had in view was to remove from my presenthabitation and take up my residence for a time in thecity of constance in the cottage of the mountains it wasimpossible o make any material alteration m my establishmentmy property was of the narrowest extent norwould it be easily practicable in a country the inhabitantsof which were accustomed to a humble allotment considerablyto enlarge it my house was frugal if not mean and unless it were first pulled down and built over againthe idea of introducing servants equipage or splendour intoit would be absurd my design was not to make a longabode where i now was but as soon as my family shouldtravels op st leon be sufficiently prepared for the transition to return to mynative country i believed in the mean time that in thecapital of the bishopric where my name was scarcely rememberedby a single individual i should be more atliberty to proceed as circumstances suggested than in mypresent rural situation where every neighbour regardedhimself as vested with a sort of inquisitorial power over allaround himto account for this measure to my family i felt it incumbenton me to confess to them a certain pecuniary acquisitionthe story that most readily suggested itself wasthat of the stranger having left behind him a certain sumof which he made a donation to me this though in theplain and direct sense of the terms it were false yet in itsspirit bore a certain resemblance to the truth and withthat resemblance in spite of the rigid adherence to veracitythat first ornament of a gentleman that most essential prerequisiteto the regard arid affection of others which i hadhitherto maintained i was induced to content myselfwhat could i do i was compelled to account for appearances i was forbidden by the most solemn injunctions tounfold the truth i should indeed have felt little complacencein the disclosure i should have been reluctant toannounce a circumstance which as i began to feel introduceda permanent difference and separation between meand my familythe sum at which i fixed the legacy of the stranger wasthree thousand crowns i was not inattentive to the future i should have been glad by my present account to havefurnished a more ample solution for circumstances whichmight occur hereafter but some regard was due to probabilityan unknown a solitary man broken with agewho arrived on foot and who declined all aid and attendancemust not be represented as possessing mines of treasureit was some time before i could prevail on myself tobreak my story to the inhabitants of my cottage as thetime approached when i was to bid an everlasting farewellto rural obscurity and a humble station they seemed toadorn themselves in new charms i was like the son of a travels of st leonking who had hitherto been told by his attendants thatwas a mere villager and who while his youthful imaginationis dazzled by the splendour that awaits him yet looksback with a wistful eye upon his mirthful sports his formercompanions and the simple charms of her who firstobtained his guileless love i announced my acquisitionand my purpose with a faltering tongue and a beatinghearti could perceive that my tale produced few emotions ofpleasure in those who heard it julia and her motherespecially were warmly attached to their retirement andthe scenes which had witnessed so many pleasurable incidentsand emotions chagrin in spite of themselves madea transient abode upon their countenances but the unresistingmildness of the

occasionallydetracted from this most enviable as in retrospecti am willing to denominate it period of my existencewe quitted our rural retreat and took up our abode inaprosperous mercantile city i

hoped was onlya temporary evil i determined accompanied by charles tomake a tour of some of the cities of germany dresdenwas the capital to which i was most desirous of conductinghim maurice duke of saxony who held his court thereand who was now only twentythree years of age was incomparablythe most accomplished prince of the empiredesirous as i was that my only son should fill a distinguishedcareer i thought i could not better prepare him for thetheatre of his native country than by thus initiating himbeforehand in scenes of distinction and greatnesshe was delighted with his tour we had not proceededmany leagues from constance before indulging in the bentof my mind i laid aside the humbleness of our appearanceand the obscure style in which we travelled and havingprocured a numerous cavalcade of horses and servants i setforward with considerable magnificence we passed throughmunich ratisbon and prague at munich we found thecourt of the elector palatine the diet of the empire wassitting at ratisbon when we arrived at that city charleshad been almost entirely a stranger to every thing princelyand magnificent from the time he was nine years of age and he was now exactly at that period of human life whenexternal appearances are apt to make the strongest impressionto him every thing that occurred seemed like transportationinto a new world the figure we made procured us asstrangers unquestioned admission into every circle wemixed with princes ourselves in garb and figure confoundedwith those we saw i had lived too much and toolong in the most splendid society to find difficulty in resumingthe unembarrassed and courtly manners which i hadfor years laid aside and charles might be said to see hisfather in a new character novelty prompted his admiration he was intoxicated with wonder his dispositiontravels op st leon had always led him to bold and adventurous conceptions nothing less than an imperious sense of duty could have restrainedhim from quitting our cottage and casting himselfupon the world in search of honour and distinction hisgenerous heart had beat to burst away from the obscurityof his station and it was with impatience and discontentthat he looked forward to the life of a swain yet he knewnot how to break through the obstacles that confined himit was therefore with transports of pleasure that he sawthem vanishing as of themselves and the career of gloryopening as if by enchantment to his eager stepsthe court of dresden was infinitely more delightful tohim than the court of munich or the imperial display atratisbon here charles saw a young prince in the flowerof his age whose talents and spirit rendered him the universalobject of attention and adoration he remarked inthe fire of his eyes the vivacity of his gestures and thegrandeur of his port something inexpressibly different fromthose princes of whom it is necessary that their rank shouldbe announced to you by some extrinsic circumstance thatyou may not mistake them for a merchant's clerk or a citymagistrate the sentiment that he breathed as it were instinctivelyas we returned from the first time of our seeingduke maurice was ef at twentythree years of age may iin appearance accomplishments and spirit resemble thisman here i was desirous of making a longer stay than at thecities through which we had previously passed and of procuringfor my son some personal intercourse with this greatornament of the age i judged this to be the more easyas in our first visit to the palace i had perceived somefrench noblemen of the protestant persuasion who had resortedto the duke's court in search of employment theyappeared not to know me but that was little to be wonderedat considering that i had been seven years absent from mycountry and that the calamities by which i had been overtakenmore than once during that period might be supposedto have produced a greater effect upon me than themere lapse of years would have done among the rest iremarked gaspar de coligny who was only twentyonen travels op st leonyears of age at the time i quitted france and had thenbeen remarked as one of the most promising young men hiscountry had to boast his stay here was expected to beshort his hopes in his own country from the greatness ofhis connections were of the highest class and he had onlycome to dresden at the earnest invitation of duke mauricewho entertained an ardent affection for him my heart ledme towards him policy concurred in dictating the applicationas if i were fortunate enough to gain his favour myson could not have a friend better qualified either to formhis character or forward his advancementi wrote to coligny to announce my request to him andin a few hours after the delivery of my letter that youngnobleman came in person to wait on me he informedme that he had done so because he had something of delicacyto mention which he did not choose to trust to theintermission of a third person and upon which as hehoped i could remove his scruple he did not like even tobestow the formality of putting it on paperi am a gentleman of france said coligny youwill excuse my frankness i am a gentleman of france you will not wonder at the niceness of my honour mixingin society i do not pretend minutely to investigate thecharacter of every person with whom i converse but whatyou ask of me obliges me to consult my understanding andenquire into facts i cannot consent to vouch for anyman's character to another till i have paid some attentionto the ground upon which that character restsi remember the count de st leon with pleasure andadvantage at the court of my own sovereign every oneadmired his accomplishments his gallantry and his learningevery one spoke of him with respect unfortunatecircumstances as we all understood deprived you of yourpatrimony that is nothing to me i respect a nobleman inmisfortune as much as when he is surrounded with wealthand splendour you retired into voluntary exile i

your countrymen havetravels of st leon remarked it as well as myself and feel themselves at a lossto account for what they seee excuse me count by your application to me youoblige me to speak freely i dare say you can clear up thedifficulty and account for this second revolution in yourfortune upon which i shall then be the first to congratulateyou i cannot suspect a man with your high descentand the illustrious character you formerly maintainedof any thing dishonourable but you have not sufficientlyconsidered the account we all owe to one anotherand the clearness of proceeding we are obliged to maintainnot only to our own hearts but in the face of the worldthe present occasion is i trust fortunate for you andwhen you have assisted me in complying with the rules bywhich every honourable man governs himself i shall beeager to publish your justification and render you all theservice in my poweri was ready to burst with astonishment and vexationduring this representation of coligny i could feel mycolour change from pale to red and from red to pale icould only answer with suffocation and inward rage that iwas much obliged to him i would consider what he said i would acquaint him with my justification and wheneverit was made he might be assured it should be anample one i was cautious as to what i uttered i couldnot immediately foresee what it was eligible or what it waspossible to do and i was resolved that i would not byan idle or hasty expression preclude myself in a matter ofso much moment from the benefits of future deliberationif what i had just heard had come from any other personi should probably have despised it but i felt at once thatgaspar de coligny might be considered in a case of thissort as the representative of all that was most honourableand illustrious in my native country finding that i wasindisposed to any further communication on the subject hetook a polite leave and departedi was no sooner alone than i felt myself overwhelmedwith mortification and shame i had rejoiced in the bequestsof the stranger because i regarded them as themeans of restoring me to splendour and replacing my childtravels of st leondrew in the situation to which they were entitled by theirbirth was that which i had regarded as the instrumentof their glory to become the medium of their ignominyand disgrace i had suffered all other misfortunes buttie whisper of dishonour had never been breathed againstme i was a son of honour descended of a race of heroesand cradled in the lap of glory and fame when wequitted paris in the year my incomparable wife hadset to sale our entire property resolved that though driveninto exile we would not leave it in the power of the meanestindividual to controvert the sacred attention we yieldedto every just obligation since that time had declinedfrom the splendour of rank to the humble situation of arustic cultivating my little property with my own hands nay i had even for a short time hired myself as a labourerin the garden of the bishop of constance but the samedisdain of every thing disgraceful had followed me to mycottage and my truckle bed which i had originally learnedin the halls of chivalry and the castle of my ancestorsaccordingly i had uniformly retained the same honourablecharacter and spotless fame st leon the virtuous cottagerhad in nothing blemished the name of st leon surroundedwith glory in the siege of pavia often and withpride had i pointed out this circumstance to my son addingwherever fortune calls you for whatever scenes youmay be reserved remember that your father was unfortunatebut that through life he never acted a deed nor conceiveda thought that should stain your manly cheeks withthe blush of shame i stand before you a culprit as havingrobbed you of your patrimony but i have preservedfor you entire the inheritance of our honour this had been the first lesson imprinted upon my infantmind all other possessions i had ever held cheap andworthless in comparison with that of an illustrious namemy indignation at the attack it now sustained was boundlessthe more i thought the more intolerable it appearedi was impatient and furious like a lion strugglingin the toils i could with joy have trampled under myfeet whoever aspersed me i could have wantoned in bloodand defied my adversaries to mortal combat alas all mytravels of st leonfury was useless here it was no tale whispered in thedark that i had to contend with it was the commentaryof the world upon incontestable facts though a hecatombof souls should be sacrificed at the shrine of my blastedname the facts would still remain the mystery still requireto be solved coligny the virtuous coligny had made noobservations on the circumstances he mentioned j he merelyproposed a

thing i most valued was now at issue and a falsestep taken under the present circumstances could never beretrieved i had another sort of party to deal with herethan when i had told marguerite the tale of the strangerand his legacy nothing would pass now but what borean open fair and unequivocal appearance i must ventno assertion that could not bear to be sifted to the bottomand that did not fully accord with all the vouchers withwhich it could be collated i had written to margueriteimmediately after launching into the expense with whichour tour had been attended that i had received an unexpectedacquisition from the death of a relation of myown family in france i knew that the story of the threethousand crowns would no longer account for the style inwhich i was proceeding and this fabrication suggesteditself upon the spur of the moment i hated to think ofthe difficulties in the way of explanation in which i wasinvolved i abhorred the system of falsehood i was drivento practise it did not occur to me at the time infatuatedas i was that i should have occasion to account for thisaccession of wealth to any one out of my own familymarguerite i well knew had no correspondence in francenor therefore any obvious means of verifying or refutingthis second deception but such a story could not be toldto noblemen of france without being instantly liable to becompared with known facts and eventually investigatedupon the spot where the scene was laid marguerite herselfi well knew had listened with incredulity to the explanationi had made and the alleged legacy of the stranger travels op st leonwhat could i expect from indifferent hearers they mightnot all possess her good sense and sagacity in judging butthey were destitute of that personal kindness and partialitywhich were calculated to induce her to credit whatever iaffirmed most men have a malignant pleasure in the detectionof specious pretences in humbling the importunatesuperiority that obscures their claims and removing therival who might otherwise acquire the prize of which theyare in pursuitmy mind was still torn and distracted with these contemplationswhen in the afternoon of the same day onwhich i had received the visit of coligny my attentionwas suddenly roused by the abrupt entrance of my son intothe chamber where i was sitting he opened the doorwith a hurried action as he entered and having closed itimpetuously after him advanced directly towards me hethen stopped himself and turning from me i could perceivea rush of crimson in his face like that of a man suffocateda passion of tears succeeded that shook his frameand sufficiently proved that his feelings had sustained someextraordinary shock my whole soul was alarmed at whati saw and following him as he retired to the other sideof the room in the gentlest accents i endeavoured to soothehim while i enquired with earnestness and trepidation intothe cause of his griefchapter xviihe repelled me sit down sir sit down do not followme i beg of you but sit down his manner was earnest and emphatically mechanicallyand without knowing what i did i obeyed his directionhe came towards mei have no time added he for qualifying and formtell me am i the son of a man of honour or a villain he saw i was shocked at the unexpected rudeness ofhis questiontravels of st leon forgive me my father i have always been affectionateand dutiful i have ever looked up to you as mymodel and my oracle but i have been insulted it neverwas one of your lessons to teach me to bear an insult is it replied i with the sternness that the characterof a father will seldom fail to inspire under such circumstances because you have been insulted that you thinkyourself authorised to come home and insult him to whomyou owe nothing but respect and reverence stop sir before you claim my reverence you mustshow your title to it and wipe off the aspersions underwhich you at present labourf insolent presumptuous boy know that i am not byyou to be instructed in my duty and will not answer so rudea questioner the down as yet scarcely shades your schoolboy'scheek and have you so forgotten the decencies oflife as to scoff your father his eye brightened as ispokeei you are right sir it gives mepleasure to see yourblood rise in return to my passion your accent is theaccent of innocence but indeed the more innocent andnoble you shall prove yourself the more readily will youforgive my indignationi cannot tell my temper does not fit me to bear therudeness of a son nor do i think that such behaviour asthis can be any credit to you whatever may have been theprovocation tell me however what is the insult that hasthus deeply shaken you i went this afternoon to the tenniscourt near the riverand played several games with the young count luitmannwhile we were playing came in the chevalier dupont mycountryman the insolence of his nature is a subject ofgeneral remark and he has though i know not for whatreason conceived a particular animosity to me a triflingdispute arose between us we gradually warmed hethreatened to turn me out of the court i resented theinsult and he passionately answered that the son of anadventurer and a sharper had no business there and hewould take care i should never be admitted again i attemptedto strike him but was prevented and presently travels op st leonlearned that the sudden and unexplained way in which wehave emerged from poverty was the ground of his aspersionas i gained time and reflected more distinctly uponwhat was alleged i felt that personal violence could neverremove an accusation of this sort i saw too though intoxicatedas i had idly been with the unwonted splendourto which i was introduced i had not adverted to it at thetime that the case was of a nature that required explanationi had been accustomed to reverence and an implicit faithin the wisdom and rectitude of my parents and thereforeencountered in silent submission the revolution of our fortunebut this neutrality will suffice no longerto you sir i resort for explanation send me backto the insolent youth and his companions with a plain andunanswerable tale that may put to silence for ever thesebrutal scoffs and reproaches let it be seen this nightwhich of the two has most fully merited to be thrust out ofhonourable society i trust i have not so demeaned myselfbut that our mutual companions will join to compelthis unmannered boor to retract his aspersionsfc charles you are too warm and impetuous too warm sir when i hear my father loaded withthe foulest appellations you are young and ill qualified to terminate in theproper way a business of this serious aspect leave it to me travels op st leonfrom you and disown your name i shall be involved in thesame disgracesaying thus he left me and in about half an hour returnedhis return i had not foreseen i had made no use of hisabsence my mind was overcome my understanding wasstupefied by a situation and events i had so little expectedi had stood

lipsand my tongue with agony from time to time i had muttereda few words my son my son wealthwealth my wife my son but they were incoherentand without meaningcharles reentered the apartment where the precedingconversation had passed and the noise he made in enteringroused me he had his hat in his hand which he threwfrom him and exclaimed with an accent of dejection andanguish my father farewell tf

worthy of more and greater benefitsthan i could ever confer on them farewell saying this he threw himself into my arms and i feltthe agonies of a parting embracechapter xviiifob some time i could not believe him departed when iretired to rest i felt the want of charles to press my handand wish me refreshing slumbers and i passed on sadand solitary to my chamber when i came next morno travels of st leoning into the breakfasting room charles was not there togreet me with looks of affection and duty and the gildingand ornaments of the apartment were to me no less disconsolatethan the damps and sootiness of a dungeoni hoped he would return i knew how tenderly he wasattached to his mother and his sisters i was fully convincedthat the affection for me which had been the perpetualhabit of his mind could not be entirely eradicatedfrom his heart i mentioned him not in my letters toconstance the pen lingered my hand trembled when ithought of him i could neither pretend that he was withme nor announce the catastrophe of his absence but iopened the letters of marguerite with still increasing impatiencefinding that he did not return to me i hopedthat some alteration of the extraordinary resolution he hadformed would lead him to constance in vain i hoped there reached me by no conveyance from no quartertidings of my son how surprising an event a youth not seventeen yearsof age forming and executing in the same instant the purposeof flying from his parents and his family desertingall his hopes all his attachments all his fortune refusingthe smallest particle of assistance or provision in his entranceupon the wide scene of the world oh charles exclaimedi you are indeed an extraordinary and admirable youth but are you fortified against all the temptations of the worldand all its hardships do your tender years qualify you tostruggle with its unkindness its indifference and its insultsin how few quarters is merit ever treated with the attentionand benevolence it deserves how often is it reduced totremble with indignation at the scoffs and brutality to whichit is exposed and at the sight of folly and vice exalted inits stead and appointed its despot and its master my sonmy son what will be your fate is your unseasonedframe reserved to perish by hunger in barren deserts andbeneath inclement skies will you not in some hour ofbitter disappointment and unpitied loneliness lay yourselfdown in despair and die will you not be made the slaveof some capricious tyrant for bread generous as is yournature will it be eternally proof against reiterated tempttravelsof st leon qaction upon what a world are you turned adrift a worldof which you know as little as the poor affrighted soul of adying man knows when launching into the mysteriousimpenetrable abyss of eternity unnatural father to havereduced my only son to this cruel alternative i shouldwith a less aching and agonising heart have accompaniedhis senseless remains to the grave dreadful as that partingis there at least the anxious mind of the survivor hasrest there are no thoughts and devices in the silence ofthe tomb there all our prospects end and we are nolonger sensible to pain to persecution to insult and toagony but charles thus departed wandering on the faceof the globe without protector adviser or resource no lapseof years can put a close upon my anxiety for him if iam in ease and prosperity i cannot relish them for myexposed and living son may be at that moment in the depthof misery if i am myself oppressed and suffering thethought of what may be his fate will form a dreadful additionto all my other calamities what am i to say ofhim upon my return to constance if he had died thiswas a natural casualty and whatever grief it might occasiontime no doubt would mollify and abate it but whataccount can now be rendered of him to his disconsolatemother and terrified sisters how can i lift up my head intheir presence or meet the glance of their reproachful eyes the idea had occurred to me in the instant of charles'sdeparture and immediately after his exit of detaining orbringing him back by force he was by his extreme youthaccording to the maxims of the world still in a state ofguardianship and unqualified to be the chooser of his ownactions but to this mode of proceeding however deeplyi felt the catastrophe which had taken place i could neverconsent it was in utter hostility to the lessons of chivalryand honour with which i had been familiarised from myearliest infancy there might be cases in which this restraintlaid by a father upon his child would be salutarybut the idea which had occasioned the secession of charleswas decisive in this instance what right had i to chainhim to dishonour the whole bent of his education hadbeen to impress him with the feelings by which he waso travels of st leonnow actuated if i detained him for a short time wasthere any vigilance on earth that could finally prevent himfrom executing a purpose upon which his whole soul wasresolved or suppose there were must not the consequencebe to break his spirit to deprive him of all manliness andenergy and to render him the mere drooping and soullessshadow of that conspicuous hero i had been anxious tomake him it might be said indeed that this was the determinationof a boy formed in an hour and that if idetained him only long enough for deliberation and revisalhe would of his own accord retract so desperate a projectbut i felt that it was a resolution formed to endure andwas built upon principles that could not change so long asan atom of his mind remained no i was rather disposedto say however grievous was the wound he inflicted on mego my son act upon the dictates of your choice as ihave acted on mine i admire your resolution though icannot imitate it your purpose is lofty and godlike andhe that harbours it was not born to be a slave be free and may every power propitious to generosity and virtuesmooth your path through life and smile upon your desires the anguish i felt for having lost my son and in thispainful and reproachful manner was not diminished to meeither by society or amusement i dared not go out of myhouse i saw no one but my own attendants i had notthe courage to meet the aspect of a human creature iknew not how far persons in dresden might have heard theinjurious reports which occasioned the flight of my son oreven have been acquainted with the nature of that flighti had promised to see coligny again but alas the affairwhich had at first led me to wish to see him was now atan end i had no heart to seek him nor indeed did iknow what story i was to tell him or how i was to removethe suspicions he had urged against me the machine ofhuman life though constituted of a thousand parts is inall its parts regularly and systematically connected nor isit easy to insert an additional member the spuriousness ofwhich an accurate observation will not readily detect howwas i to assign a source of my wealth different from thetrue which would not be liable to investigation and whentravels of st leon investigated would not be seen to be counterfeit thisindeed is the prime source of individual security in humanaffairs that whatever any man does may be subjected toexamination and whatever does not admit of being satisfactorilyaccounted for exposes him whom it concerns tothe most injurious suspicions this law of our nature sosalutary in its general operation was the first source of allmy misfortunesi began now seriously to consider what judgment i wasto pass upon the bequests of the stranger were they tobe regarded as a benefit or a misfortune ought they tobe classed with the poisoned robe of nessus which beingsent as a token of affection was found in the experimentto eat into the flesh and burn up the vitals of him thatwore it should i from this instant reject their use andreturning to the modes of life established among my fellowmencontent myself with the affection of those with whomi had intercourse though poverty and hardships mingledwith the balm the experiment i had made of these extraordinary giftswas a short one but how contrary were ah the results i hadarrived at from those i looked for when the stranger hadappeared six months before at the cottage of the lake hehad found me a poor man indeed but rich in the confidenceand happy in the security and content of everymember of my family i lived in the bosom of naturesurrounded with the luxuriance of its gifts and the sublimityof its features which the romantic elevation of mysoul particularly fitted me to relish in my domestic scenei beheld the golden age renewed the simplicity of pastorallife without its grossness a situation remote from cities andcourts from traffic and hypocrisy yet not unadorned withtaste imagination and knowledge never was a familymore united in sentiments and affection now all thisbeauteous scene was defaced all was silence suspicionand reserve the one party dared not be ingenuous andthe other felt that ah the paradise of attachment was dwindledto an empty name no questions were asked for nohonest answer was given or expected though corporeallywe might sit in the same apartment in mind a gulf wideo travels op st leonimpassable and tremendous gaped between us my wifepined in speechless grief and it was to be feared had sustaineda mortal blow my son my only son a youth ofsuch promise that i would not have exchanged him for empireshad disappeared and as he had solemnly protestedfor ever my heart was childless my bosom was bereavedof its dearest hope it was for him principally that i hadaccepted that i had rejoiced in the gifts of the strangermy darling vision was to see him clothed in the harnesssurrounded with the insignia of a hero there was nothingi so earnestly desired as that his merits graced with thefavours of fortune might cause him to stand confessed thefirst subject of france a situation more enviable than thatof its monarch since he who holds it is raised by deeds andthe other only by birth and if less respected by interestedcourtiers is certain to be more honoured by the impartialvoice of history but if i felt thus desolate and heartbrokenfor the loss of my son what would be the sentimentsof his mother more susceptible to feel and in her presentweakness of spirits less vigorous to bear than myself whenthe dreadful tidings should be communicated to her yet i could not resolve to renounce donations which ihad so dearly appropriated i held it to be abase and cowardlyto surrender gifts so invaluable upon so insufficientan experiment he i thought must be a man of ignobleand grovelling spirit who could easily be prevailed on to partwith unbounded wealth and immortal life i had but justentered the vast field that was opened to me it was of thenature of all great undertakings to be attended with difficultiesand obstacles in the commencement to present aface calculated to discourage the man that is infirm of purposebut it became my descent my character and pretensionsto show myself serene in the midst of stormsperseverance and constancy are the virtues of a manaffairs of this extensive compass often prove in the issuethe reverse of what they seemed in the outset the tempestmight be expected to disperse difficulties to unravelthemselves and unlookedfor concurrences to arise allopposition and hostile appearance give way before him whogoes calmly onward and scorns to be dismayedtravels of st leon chapter xixit was thus that i spurred myself to persist in the pathupon which i had entered having remained some timeat dresden flattering myself with the hope that charlesmight yet join me before i quitted that city i began tothink of once more turning my steps towards the residenceof my family this was no cheerful thought but uponwhat was i to determine i had a wife whom i ardentlyloved and three daughters the darlings of my heart becausei had lost a beloved son was i to estrange myselffrom these i already felt most painfully the detachmentand widowhood to which i was reduced and i clung withimperious affection to what remained of my race themeeting i purposed must be a melancholy one but in thesorrows of the heart there is a purer and nobler gratificationthan in the most tumultuous pleasures where affectionissilent i looked forward indeed to scenes of endlessvariety and attraction but in the mean time what seemedfirst to demand my attention was the beloved circle i hadleft behind in the city of constancei retraced upon the present occasion the route i hadlately pursued with my son how different were now mysensations my heart was then indeed painfully impressedwith the variance and dissolution of confidence that hadarisen between me and his mother it was perhaps principallyfor the sake of banishing this impression that i hadhad recourse to the splendour of equipage and attendancewhich was first assumed upon the journey from constanceto dresden nor frivolous as this expedient may appearin the unattractive dispassionateness of narrative had itbeen by any means weak of effect at the time it was employedwhen charles was once mounted on his proudand impatient steed and decorated in rich and costly attirei felt as it were the sluggishness of my imagination rousedi surveyed his shape and his countenance with inexpressiblecomplacence and already anticipated the period when hewas to become the favourite of his sovereign and his countof st leontry's pride now i returned with the same retinue butthe place that had been occupied by my son was empty isought him with frantic and restless gaze i figured himto my disturbed and furious imagination till the sensationsand phantoms of my brain became intolerable i ravedand imprecated curses on myself i endeavoured to divertmy thoughts by observing the scenes that passed before methey talked to me of charles they had been pointed outbyeach to each and had been the subject of our mutualcomment though charles was endowed with a high relishfor the beauties of nature and in our little retreat on theborders of the lake had lived in the midst of them he hadseen little of the variety of her features and the journeywe made through the heart of germany had furnished himwith continual food for admiration and delight nor didthe scenes i beheld merely remind me of the sensationsthey produced in charles they led me through a widerfield i recollected long conversations and digressive excursionswhich had been started by the impression theymade i recollected many passages and occurrences towhich they had not the slightest reference but whichhaving arisen while they constituted the visible scene wereforcibly revived by its reappearance thus from variouscauses my lost and lamented son was not a moment out ofmy thoughts during the journey while i continued atdresden i seemed daily to expect his return but nosooner did i quit that city than despair took possession ofmy heartthus anxious and distressed i arrived at prague andsoon after at ratisbon i travelled slowly because thoughi was desirous of returning to constance i anticipated myarrival there with little complacence as i drew nearer tomy family i felt more distinctly the impossibility of presentingmyself before them without first endeavouring totake off the shock they would sustain at seeing me returnwithout my son i therefore resolved to send forward aservant from ratisbon whom i directed to make all practicablespeed as i designed to wait for an answer he shouldbring me at the city of munich to attempt to write tomarguerite on this subject was a severe trial to me thetravels of st leoiv whole however that i proposed to myself was to removethe surprise which would be occasioned hy seeing me aloneand to anticipate questions that it would be impossible formeto hear without anguish of mind and perturbation ofcountenance i therefore took care to express myself insuch terms as should lead marguerite to believe that i hadvoluntarily left her son in saxony and that in no very longtimehe would rejoin his family i trusted to subsequentevents to unfold the painful catastrophe and could not prevailon myself to shock her maternal feelings so much as imust necessarily do if i informed her of the whole at oncecharles had not been mentioned but in ordinary terms andthe accustomed language of affection in the letters i hadrecently received from constance and i was therefore convincedthat he had neither gone to that place nor hadconveyed thither any account of his proceedingsthe answer i received from marguerite by my messengerwas as follows your absence has been long and critical and the welfareof your daughters seems to require that we should rejoineach other as speedily as may be whether we shouldmeet here or at any other place you must determine itis however right i should inform you that during yourabsence rumour has been busy with your reputation whatthe extent or importance of the ill reports circulated of youmay be i am scarcely competent to judge we have livedin uniform privacy and it is natural to suppose that theportion of censure that has reached us is but a small partof what really exists the mode in which you have proceededand the extraordinary figure you have made in aprogress through germany have given weight to these insinuationsbut it is not my intention to comment onwhat you have doneyou appear to design that i should understand youhave left my son behind you in saxony poor charles ihad a letter from him three weeks ago in which he informsme of what has happened and apologises in the most patheticterms for any seeming want of regard to me in hisconduct at the very moment that his heart bleeds for myfate i did not think it necessary to communicate

i his mother reginald there are some woundsthat we may endeavour to forgive but they leave a sentimentin the heart the demonstrations of which may perhapsbe restrained but which it is not in nature

husband forgive mereginald i did not intend to say this if i should proveunable to control the impatience of my grief do not inflictthe punishment of my offence on your innocent daughtersas to your

i were deeply distressed for the loss of my son if ilooked forward with a mingled sensation of eagerness andalarm to the approaching interview with my family it mayeasily be imagined that this letter formed a heavy additionto my mental anguish i confess i thought it a cruel onemarguerite might well suppose that the departure of charleswas a circumstance i must strongly feel and she shouldnot have thus aggravated the recent wounds of paternalgrief some allowance however was to be made for amother when we are ourselves racked with intolerablepain that certainly is not the time at which we can rationallybe expected to exert the nicest and most vigilant considerationfor another add to which she was innocentof the calamities she suffered and could not but know thati was their sole author but whatever may be decided asto the propriety of the letter its effect upon my mind waseminentlysalutary i instantly determined on the conductit became me to pursuei lost not a moment from dresden to munich i hadadvanced with slow and unwilling steps from munich toconstance i proceeded as rapidly as the modes of travellingand the nature of the roads would permit i left my retinueat the gates of the town and flew instantly to theapartments of my family i hastened up stairs and as ientered the sittingroom i saw the first and most exemplaryof matrons surrounded by her blooming daughters i instantlyperceived a great alteration in her appearance herlook was dejected j her form emaciated her countenancesickly and pale she lifted up her eyes as i entered butimmediately dropped them again without any discernibleexpression either of congratulation or resentment i embracedmy children with undescribable emotion i saidwithin myself the love and affection i had reserved forcharles shall be divided among you and added to the sharetravels of st leonyou each possess of my heart having saluted them inturn i addressed myself to marguerite telling her that imust have some conversation with

they had neverexisted she looked at me her look seemed to say though shewould not give the sentiment words that can never be theloss of charles and certain other calamities of that periodare irretrievable i resign myself into your hands i have been guilty i have had secrets meditations engendered and shut up inmy own bosom but it shall be so no more the tide ofaffection kept back from its

most solemn obligationsto discover the source of that wealth this onlyi may not communicate in all things else govern me despotically shall i resign it all shall i return to thecottage of the lake shall i go a houseless and helplesswanderer to the farthest quarter of the globe speak theword only and it shall be done i prefer your affectionyour cordial regard in the most obscure and meanest retreatto all that wealth can purchase or kings can give cc reginald i thank you i acknowledge in your presentlanguage and earnestness the object of my first andonly love this return to your true character gives me allthe pleasure i am now capable of receiving but it is toolate my son is lost that cannot be retrieved your reputationis blasted i am sorry you are returned hither constance is in arms against you and i will not answer forthe consequence for myself i grieve to tell you so iam ashamed of my weakness but my heart is broken i loved you so entirely that i was not able to bear anysuspension of our confidence i had passed with you throughall other misfortunes and the firmness of my temper wasnot shaken for this one misfortune that seemed the entiredissolution of our attachment i was not prepared ifeel every morning as i rise the warnings of my deceasemy nights are sleepless my appetite is gone from meoh marguerite talk not thus distract me not withthe most fatal of images our confidence shall return all the causes of your malady shall be removed with thecauses the symptoms depend on it will disappear youryouth your tranquillity your happiness shall be renewedoh no you shall not die we will yet live to love andpeace flatter not yourself with vain hopes my love i feelsomething wrong within me which is rapidly wearing mybody to decay reconcile your mind to what very soonmust happen prepare yourself for being the only parentto your remaining offspring i have composed my spiritand calmly wait my fate you have now administered to travels of st leonme the only consolation i aspired to by this return to yourtrue character which affords me a sanguine hope that youwill faithfully discharge the duty to your offspring whichwhen i am gone will be doubly urgent on youi was grieved to see that the mind of marguerite was sodeeply impressed with the notion that she had but a shorttime to live i could not bear to imagine for a momentthat her prognostic was just the thought seemed capableof driving me to distraction i however conceived thatthe best thing that could be done for the present was toturn the conversation to some other topicwell well my love i answered there are somethings that are immediately pressing direct me direct ahusband so amply convinced of your discretion what i amto do at present shall i instantly annihilate all that hasmade this unfortunate breach between us j shall i resignmy wealth from whatever source derived whither shallwe go shall we return to the cottage of the lake shallwe retreat into some distant part of the world how can you expect me said marguerite faintlysmiling to advise you respecting the disposal of a wealthof the amount of which i am uninformed and the sourceof which is invisible but i guess your secret thestranger who died your guest was in possession of the philosopher'sstone and he has bequeathed to you his discoveryi have heard of this art though i confess i was notmuch inclined to credit it i do not ask you to confirm myconjecture i do not wish that you should violate my engagementsinto which you have entered but upon puttingcircumstances together which i have been inevitablycompelled to do i apprehend it can be nothing else i amastonished that a conjecture so obvious should have offereditself to my mind so lateif your wealth is of any other nature ample as it apparentlyis it is a natural question to ask to whom is it tobe resigned the ordinary wealth of the world is somethingreal and substantial and can neither be created nordissipated with a breath but if your wealth be of thekind i have named let me ask is it possible to resign it a secret is a thing with which wq may choose whether wetravels of st leon will become acquainted but once known we cannot becomeunacquainted with it at pleasure your wealth uponmy supposition will always be at your beck and it isperhaps beyond the strength of human nature to refuseunder some circumstances at least in some emergencies touse the wealth which is within our reachit has been our mutual misfortune that such an enginehas been put into your hands it has been your fault tomake an indiscreet use of it gladly would i return to thetranquil and unsuspected poverty of the cottage of the lakebut that is impossible you have lost your son you havelost your honest fame the life of your marguerite is underminedand perishing if it were possible for us toreturn to our former situation and our former peace stillmy reginald forgive me if i say i doubt the inflexiblenessof your resolution the gift of unbounded wealth ifyou possess it and with wealth apparently at least distinctionand greatness is too powerful a temptation northough i should trust your resistance could i be pleased inahusband with the possession of these extraordinary powersit sets too great a distance between the parties it destroysthat communion of spirit which is the soul of the marriagetiea consort should be a human being and an equal butto this equality and simple humanity it is no longer in yourpower to returncircumstanced then as we now are the marriage unionyou must allow me to say irreparably dissolved your sonlost your fair fame destroyed your orphan daughters to beprovided for i know not if i should advise you ta forgetthe prerogative that has been bought for you at so dreadfula price beside if i am not mistaken there are great trialsin reserve for you i am afraid your present situation isextremely critical i am afraid the suspicions you haveexcited will cost you dear at all events i believe it tobe but a necessary precaution that we should fly fromconstance i have nothing therefore to recommend toyou on the subject of wealth but discretion i shall notlong live to be your adviser i shall always regard thedonation you have received you cannot wonder that ishould so regard it as one of the most fearful calamities ta travels op st leonwhich a human being can be exposed if you had usedyour prerogative with discretion you might perhapsthough i confess i do not see how have escaped the obloquyof the world into your domestic scene where the interestis more lively and the watch upon you more unremitted itmust have introduced alienation and distrust as it isi see you surrounded with dangers of a thousand denominationspolice has its eyes upon you superstition willregard you as the familiar of demons avarice will turnupon you a regard of jealousy and insatiable appetite if icould recover from the weakness that at present besets meand continue to live i foresee more and severer trials bothat home and abroad than any i have yet sustained and iam almost thankful to that providence which has decreedto take me away from the evil to cometone thing further let me add i will speak it not inthe character of a censor but a friend it must ever beright and useful that a man should be undeceived in anyerroneous estimate he may make of himself i have lovedyou much i found in you many good qualities my imaginationdecorated you in the virtues that you had not butyou have removed the veil an adept and an alchemist isa low character when i married you i supposed myselfunited to a nobleman a knight and a soldier a man whowould have revolted with disdain from every thing that waspoorspirited and base i lived with you long and happilyi saw faults i saw imbecilities i did not see them withindifference but i endeavoured and with a degree of successto forget and to forgive them they did not contaminateand corrupt the vitals of honour at length you havecompletely reversed the scene for a soldier you presentme with a projector and a chemist a coldblooded mortalraking in the ashes of a crucible for a selfish and solitaryadvantage here is an end of all genuine dignity and thetruest generosity of soul you cannot be ingenuous forall your dealings are secrecy and darkness you cannothave a friend for the mortal lives not that can sympathisewith your thoughts and emotions a generous spiritreginald delights to live upon equal terms with his associatesand fellows he would disdain when offered to himexcessive and clandestine advantages equality is the soultravels of st leon of real and cordial society a man of rank indeed doesnot live upon equal terms with the whole of his species but his heart also can exult for he has his equals howunhappy the wretch the monster rather let me say whois without an equal who looks through the world andin the world cannot find a brother who is endowedwith attributes which no living being participates withhim and who is therefore cut off for ever from all cordialityand confidence can never unbend himself butlives the solitary joyless tenant of a prison the materials ofwhich are emeralds and rubies how unhappy this wretch how weak and ignoble the man that voluntarily acceptsthese laws of existence in the advice of marguerite i saw that sound wisdomand discernment by which in all the periods of our connectionshe had been so eminently characterised with herviews of the future i was not disposed to accord i regardedthem as obscured and discoloured by the unfortunate stateof her health i could not indeed refuse to believe thatthe prerogative i had received had been the parent of muchdomestic unhappiness willingly would i have resignedall that i had derived from the stranger to be replaced inthe situation in which his pernicious legacies had found mehe had robbed me of my son he had destroyed my domesticpeace he had undermined the tranquillity andhealth of the partner of my life these calamities pressedwith a heavy and intolerable weight at my heart but ifas marguerite affirmed they were irretrievable or if theycould once be removed and the domestic advantages i hadheretofore enjoyed be restored i was not disposed to fearthose external mischiefs which marguerite so feelingly predictedi could not believe that i should have such aleague of foreign enemies to encounter nor could i easilyimage to myself any external evils which it was not in thepower of gold to remedy these considerations i urged tomy beloved partner and by enforcing them endeavoured toremove those gloomy apprehensions from the prevalence ofwhich i feared much injury to her health there wasanother circumstance i was led particularly to insist on j imean the nature of the secret intrusted to mep travels of st leontf i admire your discernment and ingenuity marguerite'said i in your conjecture respecting the source of mywealth i admire your delicacy in not pressing me to decideupon the truth of your conjecture this only i mustbe permitted to say on that subject it is a secret and youwill perceive that the same reasons whatever they arewhich make that secret obligatory on me require that itshould be respected by you the same evils that my ownindiscretion may draw on me i shall be equally exposed tobyany error or miscalculation of yours i have thereforemost earnestly and solemnly to conjure you whatever misfortunesmay hereafter befall me in whatever perilous situationi may be involved that you will never utter a syllableon this subject and that as i am the selected depository ofthis secret and alone know with certainty what is its natureyou will trust our prosperity in this point to me margueriteengaged to conduct herself as i desiredthe night which succeeded this explanation was particularlysoothing and grateful to me i was relieved froma great and oppressive burthen i was conscious of thatparticular species of pleasure which arises from the resolutedischarge of an heroic duty the peace i felt within shedits gay and reviving beams upon all around me reconciledto myself i was filled with sanguine and agreeablevisions of the future my mind obstinately rejected alldark and hateful presages i had intrusted myself and thedirection of my conduct as far as it was possible to thatbetter pilot under whose guidance if i had not avoided therocks and quicksands of life i had at least escaped withlittle comparative injury i felt therefore as if my domesticenjoyments were restored and the pleasures of my betteryears were about to run over again their auspicious careernot so marguerite she was mild gentle and soothingdispleasure and resentment towards me were banished fromher mind she endeavoured to conquer her melancholyand to forget the wounds that had been so fatal to herhopes but her endeavours were fruitless a fixed dejectionclung to her heart nor could the generous sweetnessthat pervaded her manners hide from me entirely what waspassing in her bosomduring this interval we had talked over the plan of ourtravels of st leonfuture operations marguerite was exceedingly urgent withme to quit constance nor did i though not impressedwith her presentiments feel any reluctance to that changeof scene which i believed would materially contribute tothe serenity of her mind and the restoration of her healthwe determined on some of the cities of italy as the nextplace of our residence and fixed if possible to set outsome time in the next day or the day after the plan ofproceeding to france which had lately been a favouritewith me was a favourite no longer that had been theproject of cheerful and wanton prosperity it had had for itsobject the reestablishment of my family honours and theelevation of my son now my son was lost my wife wasoppressed with languor and disease my house was overwhelmedwith sorrow this was no time for wantonnessand triumph if i could ever hope to resume the plansmy frolic fancy had sketched an interval at least of sobererhue must first be suffered to elapsemy mind at this time sustained a revolution sufficientlyremarkable but of which the urgency of events that immediatelysucceeded prevented me from ever ascertainingwhether it would have proved temporary or permanentwhen i first received the donation of the stranger mythoughts as i have already said were in a state of enthusiastictransport and amidst the golden visions in whichmy fancy revelled i became in a considerable degree alienatedfrom domestic sentiments and pleasures if i stillloved my wife and children it was the love of habit ratherthan sympathy more an anxiety for their prosperous successin the world than an earnest craving for their presenceand intercourse this state of intoxication and rapture hadnow subsided the events of the few last weeks had soberedmy thoughts having lost my son and being threatenedwith the loss of his mother i was roused to a senseof their value the influx of wealth and supernatural giftshad grown familiar to my mind and now only occupiedthe background of the picture i was once more a manand i hoped to partake of the privileges and advantages ofa man the fate reserved for these hopes will speedily beseenp travels of st leonsome readers will perhaps ask me why anxious as i wasfor the life of marguerite and visible as was the decline ofher health i did not administer to her of the elixir of immortalitywhich was one of my peculiar endowments suchreaders i have only to remind that the pivot upon whichthe history i am composing turns is a mystery if theywill not accept of my communication upon my own termsthey must lay aside my book i am engaged in relatingthe incidents of my life i have no intention to furnish theremotest hint respecting the science of which i am thedepository that science affords abundant reasons why theelixir in question might not or rather could not be imbibedby any other than an adeptchapter xxthe morning after my return to my family as i sat surroundedwith my girls and endeavouring to make myselftheir playmate and companion certain officers of justicebelonging to the supreme tribunal of the city entered myapartment they were sent as they informed me to conductme to prison my blood at this intelligence mountedinto my face to prison cried i wherefore what have idone i am no citizen of your state what

us if youdo not demean yourself quietly silence fellow answered i fiercely lead theway travels of st leon by this time the children astonished at a scene so alarmingand unintelligible to them began to express their terrorin various ways julia who was ready to faint occupiedthe attention of her mother the little marguerite clunground my knees and expressed her emotions by shrieks andcries to see her father about to be torn from her by fourstrangers the peculiarity of whose garb of office aggravatedthe rudeness of their countenances and the peremptorinessof their behaviour was a spectacle which the affectionatelyof her nature was unable to endureff i will go with you presently said i to the officersff see how you have terrified the children nay sir if you will behave civilly and make it worthour while we do not desire to hurry youi was stung with the brutal assurance with which theythus set the liberty of a few moments at a price to me buti checked my impatience i felt that it would be bothfoolish and degrading to enter into contention with suchwretches i turned from them proudly and took my childin my armsi will not be long gone my love said i thesepeople have made a mistake and i shall soon be able torectify iti fancy not muttered one of them surlilythey shall not take you away papa that they shallnot i will hold you and will not let you go e you are a good girl marguerite but i know bestwhat is proper and you must not think to control methe men will not do me any harm child they dare notperhaps i shall be back to dinner and mamma will thentell me how good you have beenas i spoke she looked steadfastly in my face and thenflinging her arms round my neck cried goodby papa and burst into a flood of tearsi embraced the other children and their mother andsaying to the latter significantly fear nothing youknow i have nothing to fear departed with my conductorsthe way to the citadel lay through the marketplacethe scene was already crowded and i had the mortifiedtravels of st leontin to be led along as a criminal in the midst of a thousandgazing eyes and enquiring tongues new as everythingconnected with my present situation was to me i hadnot anticipated this vexation i was stung with shame andimpatience to my dungeon said i to my conductorssternly if you had shown yourself better humoured'cried the most brutal of them we would have led youround by the back waythe master of the prison was somewhat less a savagethan his officers he knew my person and had heard ofmy wealth does monsieur choose the best apartmentsaid he any where that i can be alone answeredi hastily he hesitated a moment i looked in his face oh yes you will be paid he bowed and showedme to a roomi shut the door as he retired what had happened tomewas of little importance in itself the impertinence ofbailiffs and thieftakers is of no more real moment than thestinging of a gnat but i was so utterly unacquainted withscenes of this nature the pride of rank that swelledwithin me made every appearance of restraint galling tomy sense from the instant i was able to write man noone except in the voluntary compact of military servicehad ever said to me go there or do this and nowwas i to be directed by the very refuse of the species wasi to learn the prudence of not replying to their insults was i to purchase at a stipulated price their patience andforbearance i request the reader to pardon me for troublinghim with my noviciate feelings i soon learned tounderstand the world the world of a prison better but what was of more importance i was apprehendedas a criminal i had been dragged a prisoner of justicethrough the streets of constance i was by and by to besubjected to the interrogatories of the municipal tribunali could scarcely credit my senses that such an indignityhad happened to the blood of st leon it is true i wasinnocent i was conscious whatever might be my imprudencesand offences towards my own family that i haddone nothing to merit the animadversion of public justicebut this was of no consequence nothing in my opiniontravels of st leon could wipe away the disgrace of being interrogated examined of having for an instant imputed to me the possibilityof being a criminal i writhed under this dishonourand felt it as a severer attack than the question which wascomparatively of ceremony and etiquette that had oppressedme in my residence at dresdenthe next day when i was brought up for examinationi had expected to be the complainant in demanding redressfor the injury i had sustained but i was mistakeni entered the room haughtily and with the air of a manthat felt himself aggrieved of this however the magistratetook no notice do you know sir said i that i amacitizen and a gentleman of france are you acquaintedwith the treatment i have experienced have you lentyour authority to that treatment wait a few minutes replied he with an imperioustone and i shall be at leisure to attend to youi was silent after the interval of nearly a quarter ofan hour he resumedyou call yourself the count de st leon i doperhaps sir you are uninformed of the purity withwhich justice is administered in the city within whose jurisdictionyou now stand our state is a small one and itsmagistrates are therefore enabled to discharge the office ofa parent not only to its proper citizens but to all strangersthat place themselves under its protectioni remember sir that seven years ago i and my wifeand four children sick and unfriended were upon thepoint of perishing with hunger within the walls of thiscity the fact i mentioned was wholly foreign to thepoint with which i was at present concerned but theparading arrogance of the man brought it forcibly to mymemory and wrung it from my lipsmonsieur le comte replied he you are petulantit is not the office of a state to feed the souls it contains it could not do that without making them slaves itsproper concern is to maintain them in that security andfreedom of action which may best enable them to supportthemselves travels of st leoni suppressed the emotions which the tone of this speechexcited i was unwilling to enter into contention with a manwhom i regarded as inexpressibly my inferioris it cried i sternly a part of the justice you boastof to drag a man of rank and a stranger from his homewithout any intimation of the cause of his being so treatedand then instead of investigating immediately the chargeagainst him to send him to prison unheard i disdain tomention the behaviour of your officers those things naturallygrow out of the abuses practised by their superiorsthe mode of our proceeding replied he dependsupon the seriousness of the crime imputed if a man ofdistinction labours under a slight accusation only we thentreat him with all proper forbearance and respect butwhen he is suspected of a crime of more than ordinarymagnitude that alters the case the man who has ceasedto respect himself must look for no respect from othersi was for a moment thunderstruck and speechless atlength fiercely i cried produce my accusers that is not the mode of proceeding in constance ihave certain questions to propound to you when you haveanswered them we shall see what is to be done nextcarry me before the princebishop of your city if iam to be examined further let it be by your sovereign the princebishop moved by the state of our affairs inmatters of religion has been prevailed on to delegate hisjuridical authority i am the person to whom the cognisanceof your business belongs and at certain times aidedby my assessors have the power of life and death withinthis city you have had every indulgence to which youare entitled and it will be your wisdom to be no furtherrefractorypropose your questions e a person apparently greatly advanced in years arrivedin the autumn of last year at a miserable farm you at thattime cultivated called the cottage of the lake it is tohim that my questions will principally relatei stood aghast the words of the magistrate were mostunwelcome sounds i remembered that the stranger hadsaid to me when i am once buried speak of me andtravels op st leon if possible think of me no more i replied with eagernessand alarmof that person i have nothing to say spare yourquestions i have no answer to return you what was his name i know nothis countryi cannot inform youit is understood that he died or in some manner disappearedwhile under your protection yet in the registersof the church there is no notice of that event if hedied no application was made for the rites of religion tohim dying or to his body when his spirit had deserted ityou are required to answer what became of him or hisremains i have already told you that from me you will obtainno informationone question more sir seven years ago you tell meyou and your family were perishing with hunger soonafter you removed from obscure lodgings in this city tothe cottage of the lake and seemed to be laudably employedin earning for yourself a scanty livelihood with the labourof your hands but within the last six months the sceneis wholly changed you appear to have suddenly grownrich and here and in other parts of germany have actuallydisbursed considerable sums whence comes thischangethe train of questions thus proposed to me impelled meto a serious reply monsieur le juge said i c i am a stranger a nativeof france and a man of rank in my own country i havepaid your state the compliment of choosing it for my residencei have expended my industry i expend my wealthamong you i have comported myself as a peaceable inhabitantno action of my life has brought scandal uponyour state or disturbed the peace and tranquillity of youraffairs i cannot collect from any thing you have saidthat i have any accuser or that any charge has been allegedagainst me till that happens i cannot fall underyour animadversion i am a man of generous birth andtravels of st leonhonourable sentiments to myself and my own conscienceonly am i accountable for my expenditure and my incomei disdain to answer to any tribunal on earth an enquiry ofthis sort and now sir in conclusion what i demand ofyou is first my liberty and secondly an ample reparationfor the interruption i have sustained and the insults towhich i have causelessly been exposedyou are mistaken sir said the magistrate whatyou mention may be the rule of administering justice insome states they may decide if they think proper thatsome open act apparently of a criminal description mustbe alleged against a man before he can become an object ofanimadversion to the state but in constance as i havealready told you the government assumes to act the part ofa parent to its subjects i sit here not merely to investigateand examine definite acts but as a censor morum andi should violate the oath of my office if i did not lend avigilant attention to the behaviour and conduct of every onewithin my jurisdiction the city of constance requiresthat nothing immoral licentious or of suspicious charactershall be transacted within its walls your proceedingshave escaped notice too long much longer than they wouldhave done but for your late absence in cases where whatis committed is merely immoral or licentious we contentourselves with sending the offender out of our walls butyour case is of a complicated nature it has scandalisedall the inhabitants of our virtuous and religious city unlessyou answer my enquiries and give a clear and satisfactoryaccount of your wealth i am bound to believe thatthere is something in the business that will not bear thelight the coincidence of times obliges me to connect thedisappearance of your guest and the sudden growth of yourfortune this connection gives rise to the most alarmingsuspicions i have therefore to inform you that unlessyou honourably clear up these suspicions by the most amplecommunication my duty directs me to remand you toprison and to assure you that you will not be liberatedthence till you have satisfied the whole of my interrogatoriesc think deliberately answered i of your decisiontravels of st leon before you form it your prisons i despise but i willnot suffer my reputation and my honour to be trifled withi came before you willingly though i could easily haveavoided doing so because i was eager to clear my famei expected accusers and i knew i could confound accusationbut what is this that you call justice you puttogether circumstances in your own mind you form conjectures and then without information accuser or oathwithout the semblance of guilt you condemn me to prisonand expect to extort from me confession in defect ofarticles of charge i disdain to answer the only return aman of honour should make to loose conjectures and randomcalumnies is silence i am descended from a race ofheroes knights of the cross and champions of france andtheir blood has not degenerated in my veins i feel myselfanimated by the soul of honour and incapable of crimei know my innocence and i rest upon it with confidenceyour vulgar citizens habituated to none but the grovelingnotions of traffic and barter are not the peers of st leonnor able to comprehend the views and sentiments by whichhe is guidedee you are mighty wellspoken monsieur st leon repliedthe magistrate and your words are big and soundingbut we know that the devil can assume the form of an angeland that the most infamous and profligate character canpronounce with emphasis sentiments of the purest virtueyou are pleased to decide that the presumptions against youare nothing but calumnies is it nothing that having receiveda stranger and retained him with you for monthsyou endeavoured to conceal this fact and never sufferedhim to be seen by a human creature is his final disappearancenothing is it nothing that supposing him to bedead as he probably is you denied to his remains the ritesof funeral and refuse to tell what is become of the body is it nothing that upon the death of this stranger youwho were before in a state almost of penury suddenly appearto be possessed of unbounded riches where is thewill of this stranger in what archives have you depositedthe declaration of his wealth let me tell you sir thatthese presumptions which you call nothing form a body of travels of st leoncircumstantial evidence that in many countries would haveled you to the scaffold as a murderer but the laws ofconstance which you audaciously revile are the mildest inthe universe here we never put a man to death but onhis own confession we simply condemn him to perpetualimprisonment or until he makes a declaration of his guiltyou refuse to declare the name or country of the manwhom you are suspected of murdering and then have theassurance to boast that no private accuser rises against youno sir we know there can be no private accuser where theconnections of the party can be successfully concealed butshall this concealment which is an aggravation of the murderprove its security in conclusion you boast of yourblood and heroic sentiments and rail at our citizens asshopkeepers and merchants let me tell you sir shopkeepersand merchants though we are we should scorn toconduct ourselves in the obscure and suspicious mannerthat you have done and now i have taken the troubleto refute your flimsy pretences which it was wholly unnecessaryfor me to do i have done with you you knowyour destination unless you are prepared immediately to givea satisfactory account of yourself and your proceedingsfinding it impossible to make on this man the impressioni desired i declined entering into further parley andtelling him that i should convey a representation of mycase to my native sovereign and did not doubt soon tomake him feel the rashness of his proceeding i withdrewin the custody of the officers who had conducted me to thescene of audience i was i confess struck with the coincidenceof circumstances which the magistrate had placedin a light equally unexpected and forcible and which inow saw calculated to subject me to the most injurioussuspicions i was not disposed in the smallest degree toyield to the attack but i felt a desire to act deliberatelyand with caution the whole of what i had heard wasutterly unforeseen and it was with peculiar anguish that ibecame aware of this new consequence of the stranger's perniciousdonation this was a consequence that no resignationno abjuration of his bequests could cure and thatmust be stood up to with manly courage if any hope wereentertained of averting ittravels of st leonchapter xxithe appearance of wealth that accompanied me had bythis time made its impression upon my keepers and oneof them now informed me that monsieur monluc an agentof the court of france who was making a tour of severalof the german states hy order of his sovereign had arrivedthe night before at the city of constance there was norepresentative of my country regularly resident here andi immediately felt the presence of monluc to be the mostfortunate event that could have occurred for effecting myhonourable deliverance selfishness and avarice it may bethoughtwould rather have impelled the persons who hadme in custody to conceal from me a circumstance calculatedto deprive them of an advantageous prey but inthose groveling souls from whom riches never fail to extorthomage however strange it may seem the homage oftenappears disinterested they pay it by a sort of irresistibleinstinct and admiring what they covet at an awful distancewith difficulty assume the courage to pollute theirworship with ideas of calculation and gaini immediately addressed a memorial to this gallant soldierwith whose person indeed i was unacquainted butthe fame of whose spirit and enterprise had not failed tohave reached me i represented to him that i was afrenchman of family and distinction that i had beenseized upon and was retained in prison by the magistrateshere without accuser or the hope of a trial that i had notbeen guilty of the shadow of a crime and that i knew thebenignity and courage of my sovereign would never permita subject of france to languish under calumny and oppressionin a foreign country i added that he would do anacceptable service to king francis to whom i had the honourto be known by interfering in my favour and thereforeentreated him to obtain for me immediate justice anddeliverance monluc returned me an answer by the bearerof my memorial assuring me that he would lose no timein enquiring into the merits of my case and that i mighttravels of st leondepend upon receiving every assistance from him that aman of honour could desirethe warmth and frankness of this answer filled me withhope for there was no deliverance from my present situationthat i could contemplate with satisfaction but sucha one as should be accompanied with reparation and eclatthree days however elapsed before i heard again from thefrench envoy on the morning of the fourth he announcedhis intention of visiting me and about an hour afterarrived at the prison his appearance was striking hewas tall slender and well made with a freedom of carriagenot derived from the polish of courts but which appearedto flow from the manliness and active energies ofhis mind his hair and complexion were dark the formerthough he was still young rather scantily shaded a highand ample forehead his features were expressive of thesanguine and dust temper of his mind and though hiseye was animated his countenance as he entered struckme as particularly solemn you are the count de st leon said hei amyou sent me a memorial a few days ago complainingof the tribunal of this city i am afraid sir i can do nothingfor youmy countenance fell as he spoke i gasped for breathi had conceived a most favourable anticipation as he enteredand my disappointment was particularly cruel ihad said in my heart this is the very man to rescue myinjured famei see sir you are disappointed resumed hehave not given up the affair if i had this visit which idesign as a mark of attention would be an insult themoment i received your memorial i paid the utmost regardto it if the affair had been as you represented it iknow i could not do any thing more acceptable to my sovereignthan interfere in your behalf i have spent thewhole interval in investigating the case i have seen themagistrate who committed you i have visited the spotwhere your crime is alleged to have been perpetrated ihave had an interview with your wifetravels of st leon well sir cried i alarmed and impatient wellsir and the result appearances are uncommonly strong against you theycan scarcely be stronger but you have a right to be heard it is for the sake of discharging that last act of justice thatyou see me this morningf great god exclaimed i overwhelmed with chagrinf is if possible that my countryman the man to whom iwas proud and happy to appeal the gallant monluc shouldbelieve me a murderer i swear by every thing that issacred by the blood of him that died for me on the crossand by my eternal salvation that i am as innocent as thechild unborn i am glad to hear you express yourself with this emphasisand fervour i cannot but say that to my ownfeelings it has great weight but i must not suffer myselfas a man and still less in the public capacity in which istand to heovercome and confounded by your asseverationsthere is a connected and most unfavourable story againstyou this it is incumbent on you to clear upand you say you have seen my wife i was distractedand overwhelmed by monluc's way of putting thequestion i was divided between my anxiety to be justifiedand the solemn mystery of the affair to which his enquiriesled and i probably spoke thus from an unconscious desireto gain time yesthat is another presumption in your favour madamede st leon is perhaps the most striking and extraordinarywoman i ever saw of the husband of such a womanespecially when he appears to be the object of her attachmenti should be always inclined to think well madamede st leon pleaded for you with earnestness and affectionbut amidst all her ardour i could perceive that she feltthere was something mysterious and unpleasant in the affairthat she was unable to developedas monluc spoke i saw that i had failed in one of themain anchors of my hope i thought that no one couldhave talked with my beloved marguerite and have left herwith the opinion that i was a murderer how did this happen was she lukewarm and unfaithful in my vindication travels of st leonwhat she continued my countryman i could seewas not only unable to explain hut did not fully understandit is you alone can clear the concealment of thestranger his disappearance what became of the body andyour own sudden transition from poverty to wealthi was by this time fully sensible of the nature of mysituation i summoned my fortitude i felt that i had nolonger any hope but in the dignity of innocenceyou call on me for explanation replied i canyou not conceive gallant monluc that i may be able toresolve your doubts and yet that i will not explanationis not the business of a man of honour he cannot stoopto it he will win the applause and approbation of mankindif won in silence he will hold on the even courseof a generous spirit and turn neither to the right nor to theleft to court the suffrage or deprecate the condemnation ofa giddy multitude such my brave countryman have beenthe maxims of my past life such will be the maxims ofmy futurei admire answered monluc at least the gallantryof these sentiments though i may be inclined to doubt theirprudence but if such is your determination permit meto say you have no concern with me he who resolutelywithholds explanation must arm himself with patience andeither wait the operation of time or rest satisfied with theconsciousness of his innocenceand is that all will there not be some noble spiritswho separating themselves from the herd will judge ofhim by what they feel in their own breasts and be drawnto him with an irresistible impulse was it not naturalthat i should expect monluc to be one of these it wouldbe hard indeed if he who disdains to temporise withpopularity and to vindicate himself from the ungenerousconstructions of sordid minds should not by that very proceedingsecure the friendship and sympathy of those whosefriendship it will be most grateful to him to possessthe friends of an innocent man whom a combinationof circumstances has exposed to the most painful suspicionsmust always be few he can scarcely expect the acquittaland sympathy of a stranger i must know i must havetravels of st leon felt and observed in a man a thousand virtues before i canbe entitled to treat accumulated presumptions against himas nothingand thus then are to end my hopes in monluc hedoes not feel that i am innocent he does not recognisein me the countenance the voice the turn of thought of abrother a man no less incapable than himself of every thingdisgraceful and ignominious be it so i will as you adviseme rest upon the consciousness of my innocence afrenchman the descendant of illustrious ancestors long anexile long the victim of adversity but at all times consciousof the purity of my sentiments and the integrity of myconduct i will not suffer myself to be overwhelmed withthis last desertion this ultimate refusal of justice count de st leon your appeal is full of energy inwhatever way i decide it will leave an

not abuse your confidence i will make no use of yourcommunication but such as you shall yourself approveonly enable me to have a reason for acting that is notmerely capable of being felt but that i may know is in itsown nature capable of being stated to another it is uponme that you call to take certain measures you must enableme to judge of their proprietyyou are mistaken when you suppose the appearancesagainst you to be slight it is not a slight circumstancethat you profess to be ignorant of or have refused to disci travels of st leonclose the country the connections and even the name ofthe stranger whom you so anxiously concealed the disappearanceof his body is still more extraordinary whatintelligible motive except a guilty one can i assign forthat but your sudden wealth immediately after this disappearanceis especially material it is a broad and glaringfact that men cannot shut their eyes on if they wouldthe chain and combination of events that proceeds systematicallyfrom link to link is the criterion of guilt andthe protector of reputation your case as it now standsis scarcely to be termed equivocal upon the supposition ofyour criminality all is plain and easy to be accounted for upon any other supposition it appears an inscrutable mysteryplace but the balance even present to me an expositionof these facts that shall make your innocence not

assured i will cheerfully do for you i cannotdeliver you from prison but i will not fail to obtain themitigation you ask farewell such was the issue of my interview with monluc itwas clear that my reputation was wounded beyond the powerof remedy while the question had only been of a magistratehaughty supercilious insolent and unfeeling i flatteredmyself that the harshness of the conclusions that weredrawn might be ascribed to the depravity of his characterbut monluc was the reverse of this man he was not lessgenerous and heroic than the magistrate was gross and illiberalhis desire to relieve me was not less apparent thanthe magistrate's eagerness to oppress yet his conclusionwas the same and was felt by me so much the more bitterlyin proportion to the humanity the kindness the intrepidityand the virtue of the man from whom it flowedq travels of st leonvirtue and vice barbarism and refinement were equallyengaged in the concert against me and there was no chancei should triumph in a contention with so many enemiesi might now be said to have reached the end of my adventure i had closed one grand experiment upon thedonation of the stranger what had it produced to me not one atom of the benefits i anticipated not a particle ofthose advantages which a little while ago had made the intoxicationsof my waking dreams its fruits had been distastefuland loathsome whether i looked to my personmy family or my fame i had felt in all the miserableeffects of this treacherous and delusive gift my personwas shut up in prison and i was now to make an experimentwhether by clandestine and secret proceedings wealthcould restore to me the liberty of which wealth had deprivedme my family was blasted my wife was struck to theheart and no mortal skill could restore the wound she hadsuffered my son was gone unaided into voluntary exilethat he might shun the contagion of my follies what wasi to do with the poor remains of my house forlorn dejectedand wretched the wound my good name hadreceived was of the most decisive species when i firstencountered contumely at dresden and was called on forexplanation by coligny the difficulties of my conditionstruck anguish to my soul but what were they comparedwith what had now overtaken me i was charged withrobbery and murder with every thing that combines thewhole species against the perpetrator and determines themwithout sense of compunction to extirpate him from theface of the earth perhaps it was only by the courtesy ofthe laws of this state that i was permitted my choice betweenan ignominious death and perpetual imprisonmenti might possibly indeed escape from my confinement imight pass into a distant country i might be fortunateenough to cut off all connection between my past and myfuture life and thus enter upon a new career but this toa man of honourable mind is a miserable expedient withwhat feelings does he recollect that there is a spot wherehis name is abhorred where a story is told against him toexcite the wonder of the ignorant and the torpid feelings oftravels of st leon the sluggish soul a story to darken with new infamy therecords of guilt and to infect the imagination of the solitaryman with nameless horrors to be the theme of such atale is no common evil no matter how far the man towhom it relates shall remove from the detested spot thespot itself with all its chain of circumstances will oftenrecur the voices that repulsed and humbled him will ringin his ear the degraded figure he made will rise for everfresh to his imagination he cannot ascend to any free andlofty sentiment he cannot attain the healthful tone of unblemishedvirtue j wherever he goes he carries the arrowof disgrace in his bosom and when he would erect his headon high it reminds him of the past and stings him to theheartif the consciousness of all this would have been painfulto any other man what was it to me who had beenbrought up from my infancy in the opinion that fame wasthe first of all human possessions and to whom honourand an unimpeached integrity had ever been more necessarythan my daily food or than the life which that food supported what would i not have given could i have returnedto the situation in which the inauspicious arrival of thestranger had found me but that was impossible if allthat i had recently passed through could but have proved adream if i could have awakened and freed myself from thephantoms of this horrible vision how happy beyond allnames of happiness should i by such an event have beenmade what a lesson would it have taught me of theemptiness and futility of human wishes what a sovereigncontempt would it have impressed upon me for wealth andall its train of ostentation how profound a feeling of contentmentwith humble circumstances and a narrow stationwould it have produced in my mind alas the conceptionof those advantages and that peace was the illusion and notthe evils i had sustained and from which i could notescape q travels of st leonchapter xxiimeanwhile it was necessary that i should make the bestof the present circumstances my heart was wounded myspirit was in a manner broken but not so utterly witheredand destroyed as to make me rest supine in perpetual imprisonmenti felt with equal conviction and pungencythat my character and my happiness had sustained thedeepest injuries but i felt it incumbent on me to collectand improve the fragments that remained for some daysindeed after the conference with monluc i was sunk in thedeepest dejection but as that dejection subsided i beganto turn a steady attention upon the future i recollectedthat an eternal and inexhaustible gift deserved to be madethe subject of more than one experiment before a decisionwas formed upon its merits i shall become wiser said ias i go forward experience however bitter will teachme sagacity and discrimination my next experiment shallbe made with more prudence and a soberer gradation iwill remove to some distant country where the disadvantagesof my past adventures shall not follow me i willtake a new name i shall then enjoy the benefit of a tyrojust entering a scene to all the personages of which he iswholly unknown i shall be like a serpent that has strippedits tarnished and wrinkled skin and comes forth in all thegloss and sleekness of youth surely in an unknown landwith the prejudice of wealth in my favour and no prejudicesagainst me i shall know how to conduct myself so asto obtain honour and respect it is impossible that inexhaustiblewealth and immortal youth gifts so earnestlycoveted by every creature that lives gifts which if i wereknown to possess my whole species from the mere impulsesof envy would probably combine to murder me as not ableto endure the sight of one so elevated above his brethrenit is impossible that such gifts should not be pregnant withvariety of joymarguerite greatly contributed to raise me from thedejection into which my imprisonment and the conferencetravels of st leon of monluc had sunk me she was my better genius ihad been so accustomed to receive consolation from her lipsin the most trying circumstances that now the very soundof her voice was able to smooth my wrinkled brow andcalm my agitated spirit i listened as to the sound of anangelic lyre i was all ear i drank in the accents of hertongue and in the dear delight my cares were hushedand my sorrows at an end she talked to me of her daughterswhom she represented as about to have no protectorbut their father she urged me to watch over them and totake such steps as should most conduce to their future virtueand happiness she pointed out the practicability ofescape and recommended to me to fly to some distantcountry the dreams of future prosperity from the gifts ofthe stranger were not hers they were all my own it wasinexpressibly affecting at this time to receive consolationfrom her who had no consolation in her own breast whohad bid farewell to all the gay attractions of the world andtalked familiarly of her death as a thing certain to happenin no very long time she had lost the purest gratificationsof the domestic scene she had lost her son her heartwas broken yet with her dying accents she sought to dispelretrospect and inspire cheerfulness in the breast of herhusbandthe reader may perhaps imagine that i was somethingtoo sanguine when surrounded with jailors and all theprecautions of a prison i planned the nature and scene ofmy next residence exactly as if i had been a person atlarge but i took it for granted that the power of moneyi possessed would easily unlock to me the gates of my captivityi believed that upon the lowest calculation personalliberty was clearly included among the gifts of thestranger impressed with this opinion t fixed upon anegro a servant of the prison and who had the keys of myapartment as the subject of my pecuniary experiment theidea of applying to him had perhaps first occurred to mefrom the mere circumstance of my seeing him more frequentlythan any other attendant of the prison when ithought further of the matter i judged from the meannessof his rank and his apparent poverty that i could not have travels of st leonchosen better so far as related to the sum to be paid asthe price of my liberty it was indeed indifferent to mewhether it were large or small i had however suffered somuch from the inconsiderate lavishing of wealth that i hadno inclination on the present occasion to make ostentationof more than was necessary but what was of most importanceto me i was desirous that my first experimentshould be a successful one though not unaware of thepower of gold i conceived that among persons of middlingrank and easier circumstances there might be varietiesof disposition and i might be mistaken in my choicesome might have the whim of integrity or might place asturdy sort of pride in showing that they were content withwhat they had and were too high for a bribe theremight be persons who though of plebeian rank might valuereputation as much as ever i had done and be of opinionthat no advance of station could compensate for the nameor the consciousness of dishonour these distinctions mayseem an idle and superfluous refinement when it is consideredthat i had the power of raising my bribe to the levelof any man's honesty or pride be it as great as it might and it may be thought that my offer might be so increasedas to be too dazzling for mortal firmness to resist be thatas it will i am merely stating the reflections that passedthrough my mind not entering into their vindicationtaking the first opportunity then of accosting this manwhen he was alone with me i addressed him thus my good friend are not you poor yes sirwould not you readily do me a kindness if my master give me leave i willyou mistake me would you be my friend e i do not know what you mean sir i have been usedto call the man i love my friend if you mean that youknow i cannot choose whether i wil be a man's friend itcomes of itself can i not make you my friend that is make me love you i was surprised at the propriety of his answers i amunable at this distance of time to recall the defects of histravels of st leon language and i disdain the mimic toil of inventing ajargon for him suitable to the lowness of his condition thesense of what he said i faithfully report i had before beenstruck with a certain correctness of thinking in him but i now examined his countenance more attentively thani had ever before done and thought i could distinctlytrace in it the indications of a sound understanding and anexcellent hearti do not know sir continued he if i see thatyou are a good man i believe i shall love you but if ithappened that you were good and generous to me i am surei should love you very much you are very poor so they tell me i never had more than a shilling ortwo at a time in my lifeit is a very sad thing to be poor fe why yes so i have heard sir but for my ownpart i am always merry and gaymy good fellow i will make you richthank you sir but what good will that do me f you are a servant i will make you a master ofservantsnow that i should not like at all i am merry becausei am lighthearted if i had money and propertyto take care of and servants to direct i am afraid theywould make me grave and suspicious and in every respectunlike what you see mees is it possible you should be pleased with your presentsituation under the orders of one man in a house andobliged to play the tyrant to the rest why as you say sir there may be more agreeablesituations than the life of a jail but as to being underorders i have no objection to that i never knew any othercondition and therefore i am contented it is not pleasantindeed to have a master who is always scolding and dissatisfied but the gentleman i serve at present is reasonable i know how to content him and when i have donethat he leaves me to please myself you offer me money now sir that is not what i call being generous i countnothing for much except when a man shows me has bowels travels of st leonand convinces me that he thinks justice due even to anegro i dare say however you designed it for generosityand expected something from me in return tell me whatit is you want and whatever i can do with propriety youmay depend on it i willdo you approve of a man's being deprived of hisliberty will you please to tell me what you mean by liberty you offered me just now what you called liberty and independence and i am content to be a servantwould you be pleased instead of being a turnkey tohave the key turned on yourselfthat i should not i understand the disagreeablenessof that well enough for when i first entered this place itwas as a prisonerif then my good fellow you were convinced that iwas a man disposed to be generous to you

i had strictly enjoined himsecrecy towards every member of my family my precautionhad extended no further for as i have said iscarcely knew that he had the most casual intercourse withany person beyond my own roof but hector naturallydreaded that what i was so earnest to conceal from everyonein my house he would be highly to blame to communicateto a stranger he therefore peremptorily refusedand with many signs of distress to say another word on thesubjectthe donzella piqued at his resistance had recourse tofemale arts she was cruel she uttered words of sharpdispleasure and disdain she knew that a person who refusedher such a trifle could not have an atom of regard forher she commanded him never to see her more unsuccessfulin these expedients she had recourse to expedientsof a

he could not resolve uponanything that was not considerate and respectful towards heras the framing of artful questions was the stronghold ofthe donzella and she might have challenged in this

of all human undertakings was he capableof detecting the various faces of a doubtful questionand of guarding himself against the traps of an insidiousfoe it was not till the fourth interview from hector's originalhint that the donzella had recourse to this species ofattack and she did not withdraw her forces till she hadextorted from him all he knewwhen hector found that all his guards were baffled andput to flight he had then recourse to the only expedientthat remained conjuring her by every thing sacred andevery thing tremendous not to betray a trust she had soungenerously obtained from him she readily promisedevery thing he desired soothed by her compliance hedetermined not to mention to me the lapse of which he hadbeen guilty it would in his opinion have been little lessthan

the donzellawas by no means so scrupulous or delicate in her sentimentsas my humble but faithful attendant as she hadgiven her company to hector she had had an opportunityof observing in him such integrity and goodness of heartas could not fail to extort the esteem of any human beingshe really honoured him she was unwilling to give himany cause of uneasiness but she had another lover

hector's donzella was as i afterwards founda fellow of a gloomy and ferocious disposition a true italianspadaccino determined that none should perpetrate an affrontagainst him with impunity but should expiate insome refined and cruel vengeance the levity by which theyhad been so unfortunate as to give birth to his hatred heby no means relished or approved the liberal and goodhumouredsentiments of the donzella often had they inflictedon him the darkest torments of jealousy nor had he failedat least in one preceding instance to make his rival thevictim of his resentment the donzella however went onin her career she was light of heart gay in temper andcareless of consequences she had always hitherto succeededby playful blandishments or more serious demonstrationsof contrition in mollifying the temper of herbrute and every pardon she received operated with her asanew permission to offend she did not sufficiently considerthat she was thus continually raising to a higher pitchthe frenzy of his malice hector in the mean time wasutterly unconscious and ignorant of the perilous situationin which he stood while to the apprehension of agostinothe giving him a negro for a rival whom his pride regardedas belonging to an inferior species of beings and his devoutignorance likened to the leader of the infernal squadronswas the last and most intolerable insulthis malice was ingenious and subtle he disdained thevulgar revenge of stabbing his antagonist in the dark andsupposing that his enmity could be gorged by a blowwhen the venom of his nature was thoroughly put in motionnothing could restore it to quietness and tranquillity butsome mighty stroke to excite the wonder of every bystanderand that should leave behind it a track of desotravels of st leonnation never to be filled up again and erased he heardtherefore with unsated appetite and eager joy the tale of necromancyand infernal machination repeated to him fromhector by the donzella the impression which the narrativeproduced upon him was a mixed sentiment oftransport at the apprehension of such an instrument ofvengeance and of palpitating hatred superstition teachinghim to believe and to view with abhorrence that which hedesired to render tenfold more an object of faith and aversionto his neighbours he struck an auspicious and augustalliance between his revenge and his religion his religionexciting him to exterminate that the destruction of whichwould produce inexpressible gratification to his revengethe darkness of his spirit led him to proceed with doublecaution and vigilance in his correspondence with the dondellahe discovered nothing to her of the dark projectwhich was engendering in his mind and only betrayed somuch of his superstitious feelings and fears as by givingnew emotion might stimulate her to gratify his curiosityand her own by a detection of further particulars he wasassiduous in the underhand and sinister propagation of thetale to which he did not fail to give his own colouring andaffix his own feelings he was desirous that the trainshould be laid in silence and that the explosion he designedshould be free from all presignification of the event thusan individual of whose animosity i had no apprehensionand the meanness of whose appearance would probably havemade me neglect all precaution against him gave methodand direction to an evil of which however upon a reviewi am not inclined to doubt i should have been the victimif the enmity and industry of this individual had beenwholly withdrawnthe mischief was long in preparation before i receivedin any way the slightest intimation of the predicament inwhich i stood the first circumstance at all calculated toexcite alarm in my mind was the singular manner in which ifound myself regarded if i entered any of the neighbouringvillages or met the rustics and their dames as i strayedalong the roads or the fields they fled my approach desertedthe streets and carefully shut themselves up in their travels of st leonhouses till i had passed where it was impossible toavoid me they bowed themselves to the earth in the mostsubmissive guise before me while the most lively terrorwas painted in their countenances dreading lest they shouldexcite the resentment of a tremendous and inexorable foethese tokens however were far from inspiring me with aconception of the truth they perplexed they astonishedthey distressed me sore as i was with my recent afflictionsmy mind was but too fully prepared for anticipations ofevil i had suffered from suspicions i had suffered fromcalumnious imputations i had suffered from the malignanteffects of popular rumour had i yielded my confidenceto any person but such a one as hector it is probable mysuspicions would have turned on that side but my relianceon him was not less than that which alexander the greatyielded to philip the physician i knew his rectitude hissimplicity his fidelity and the singleness of his heart andi could not harbour the shadow of a doubt respecting himmy reliance was of that entire and perfect sort which didnot express itself by a recollection of the physical possibilityand an acquittal founded in deliberation but by a totalvacancy of doubt or of retrospect that way directed justsuch as the state of my mind would have appeared if thething had been naturally impossiblei was not however ignorant and raw enough to be deceivedby the exterior of homage i have described i sufficientlyknew that what i beheld was the offspring ofhatred to feel one's self hated is in all instances a painfuland humiliating state of the human mind to me it wasespecially so i was not formed to retaliate this species ofinjury i could not hate in my turn i was formed tolove i could not look upon my species with dark andgloomy contemplations i was prompt to admire theirvirtues and perhaps even too prompt to extenuate theirerrors it may i believe be laid down as a rule thatthey who cannot hate can least endure to be made objectsof hatred fettered however as i now was by the tenderestconsideration for the health and tranquillity of margueritei thought it best to temporise and submit in silencemy principal anxiety was to hide these symptoms from thetravels of st leonnotice of my family this i could not completely effect some of them were too glaring and obtrusive entirely toescape the observation of my daughters in their walks butthe filial forbearance they felt towards their mother led themimplicitly and without any concerted plan to concur withme in my exertions for her quietthe animosity of agostino was restless and inextinguishablehis plans did not terminate in exciting againstme a secret and covered abhorrence they aimed at nothingless than my utter destruction the next exertion of theconspiracy which was engendering against me was of a tragicalnatureit happened one night after all my family was retiredto rest and i was myself sunk into a slumber that i wassuddenly alarmed at the report of a musket which seemedto be fired almost under the window of my chamber thiswas a very singular circumstance and calculated to conveyan impression of danger i leaped from my bed and ranto the window the night was extremely dark and everythingseemed perfectly quiet presently i discerned aglimmering light like that of a lantern which however appearedto be gradually retiring to a greater distance i wasnot thus satisfied but determined to hasten down stairs andinvestigate the cause of the disturbance marguerite whohad heard the firing of the musket as well as myself nowcalled me to her and entreated me not to expose myself tounnecessary danger in compliance with her remonstrancesi promised though unwillingly not to go out into thecourt or upon the lawn but to content myself with examiningthe state of every part of the house when i cameto the staircase and the hall i found that the alarm had communicatedto almost every person in the family who presentlyassembled round me we parole the house butfound every thing in the situation in which it had beenleft and nowhere any appearance of violence i openedseveral of the windows but all was darkness and silencehaving thus far satisfied myself i listened with a degreeof amusement to the conjectures and sage remarks of severalof the servants a rank of society who may usually be foundto derive a degree of enjoyment from incidents of this sort travels of st leonwhich for the moment strikingly tend to level all artificialdistinctions and confer on every one the liberty of utteringhis reflections without apprehension or constraint i did nothowever feel myself entirely easy the circumstance whichhad just occurred combined with the forebodings whichhad lately impressed me had filled me with undefinableterror and alarm hector would willingly have gone overthe grounds contiguous to the house to see if he could discoverany thing that related to or could explain the incident but i had promised marguerite that i would search nofurther and the temper of my mind would not suffer meto expose another to a danger which i abstained from encounteringin my own person it was more than an hourbefore the conclave in which we were assembled broke upand every one retired fatigued with attention and preparedto fall into the soundest sleep my dreams were uneasyand disturbed my mind was in a tumult of imaginarycalamities and i passed the greater part of the night in astate of singular anxietyin the morning i was scarcely sunk into a refreshingslumber before i was suddenly roused from sleep by arepetition of shrieks of astonishment and distress i puton my clothes as quickly as i could and hastened towardsthe spot from which the sounds appeared to proceed thefirst object i beheld was the little boy of ten years oldwhom charon had a short time before dragged out of theriver stretched along upon the lifeless body of this faithfuland generous animal the musket the report of whichhad alarmed us the night before had no doubt been aimedagainst charon and the greater part of its contents appearedto be lodged in his body as no further sound had succeededthe firing he had probably been killed on the spothe was at a small distance from the house near a privatefootpath where he had been found in the morning by thelad whose life he had recently preserved the poor boyhad not at first understood what had happened to his benefactorbut only thought him asleep and prompted byaffection for the generous creature had quietly sat down byhim till he should awake he had not sat long howeverbefore he discerned about him the marks of blood hetravels op st leon put his hand to the wound the animal stirred not hepassed to his head he saw his eyes fiery and starting andhis lips distorted he endeavoured to awake him as onewould awake a human being to whom some mischief hadhappened of which he was not aware all his efforts werefruitless he found his body motionless and his jointsstiff in death the apprehension of what had occurredthen suddenly flashed on his mind he burst out intoshrieks of astonishment and anguish hector was the firstperson who caught the sound and hastened to the spot iimmediately followed the poor negro who in the innocenceof his heart was uninitiated in the proud distinctionsby which civilised man is taught to place so vast a barrierbetween the human nature and the brute was struck speechlesswith sorrow and amazement he recognised the deadbeing before him for his fellowcreature he recollectedin him his friend his companion his intimate

a stress upon so petty and insignificant anincident as the death of a dog it might have been littleto other persons it was not little to us let the readerrecollect his ingenuity in procuring aid for his dying masterhis gratitude to the person by whom that aid was affordedand his unconquerable antipathy to his master's murdererthese are not common traits there are many men whosepremature fate has been the most unrelentingly avengedthat in moral and useful qualities could not have stood thecomparison with my generous charon it surely was nocommon cause for regret that a creature who had distinguishedhimself by a conduct so peculiarly admirable shouldhave encountered so premature and unmerited a fate hisconduct the reader may in some degree comprehend andappreciate j but i should in

ourselveswhat we saw as we knew not in what we hadoffended we were unable to atone for our fault or even toguard ourselves against the repetition of it nor were weby any means prepared to comprehend the extent of ourdanger happily marguerite whose health was now in arapid decline was least exposed to the observation of thisnew mischief though she felt enough of it to confirm herin the sentiment

the most violentanxiety and trepidation he burst upon me in my studywhere i was sitting alone buried in one of those deepreveries which especially since the legacy of the strangerhad been among the most frequent habits of my mindhis perturbation was such as to render it impossible forhim to impose on himself the smallest degree of cautionand restraint the noise he made in entering the apartmentstartled me i looked up and perceived his featuresswelled his face bruised and his garments disfigured withbloodfor heaven's sake hector exclaimed i what isthe matter he answered not he advanced towards the upper endof the room he took down a pistol one of those which ialways kept loaded in my apartment he came towards mehe fell upon his knees he tendered the pistol to my acceptance hector cried i what am i to understand whatis the meaning of this kill me dear master for christ's sake i entreatyou to kill me i took the pistol from his hand it pointed towardsthe floorand will you

strange andterrible stories that were circulated of me the antipathyuniversally entertained against me the active ferociousnesswith which this antipathy was accompanied and theconsequences that he feared would result he ascribedthe whole to his own imprudence and to the particularswhich the superior cunning of the donzella in spite of hisinvincible refusal to acquaint her with a single circumstancehad wrung from him hector had collected severaltravels of st leon of these particulars accidentally from a neighbouring rusticand had been vehement in my defence while they wereeager in debate others had joined them but hector hadfound them all opponents not one a supporter irritatedwith the contest and the opprobrious language heapedupon himself and his master hector had been provoked tostrike the most insolent of the disputants immediatelyseveral had fallen upon him at once and it was owing tothe uncommon strength and dexterity he possessed thathe had escaped alive out of their hands beside innumerableblows with fist foot and stick he had receivedtwo or three stabs in different parts of the body from theknives with which the italian is too much accustomed toassail his adversary it was easy to see that the gallantand generous defence of hector had considerably augmentedthe danger of my situation they dismissed him with athousand execrations against both him and myself andvows that they would sign ah se their vengeance by settingfire to my house having related his story hector concludedwith again earnestly conjuring me to kill him thatso he might expiate the

with particulars and the wholeextent of the danger doubt not but i will employ suchprecautions and be so awake to my situation as to forestalthe possibility of mischiefthus i endeavoured to assuage

supporttheir united pressure he intreated me not to lull myselfin fancied security and fall blindfold on my ruin he entreatedme not to forgive him my clemency and forbearanceserved only to make him regard with greaterhorror the crime of which he had been guilty if howeveri refused to punish him and by penance or death to lightenthe remorse that hung upon his heart he would at leastdevote himself in opposition to the evil he had createdand die rather than it should touch a hair of our headsthis idea he seemed to view with some complacency butthe pleasure it gave was a glimmering and momentarylight he could not remain in any place for an instant he wrung his hands with anguish and exhibited everyfeature of the deepest despair i examined his bruises andwounds the latter of which though attended with a copiouseffusion of blood did not appear to be dangerous i warnedhim to be guilty of no further indiscretion to betray nothingof what had happened to any one of my family andto

solitude it by no meansappeared to me in a light and trivial point of view onepart of hector's story had related to the death of charonwho i now found had owed his fate to the superstitionof my uncultivated neighbours i had always entertaineda formidable idea of the character of an italian populacewhom i regarded as more suspicious sanguinary andviolent than any other race of men in the world i deploredmy fate that exposed me to their rage i deploredmy folly that had admitted any confidant into myindividual pursuits though my confidence had been solimited and its receiver so trustworthy that i could nothave imagined any evil would have resulted i determinedthat i would not expose myself to the risk of suchsinister consequences as in my opinion might in my pretravelsof st

myself that the progress was in an oppositedirection but the delusion was soon banished anotherdifficulty arose in addition to the rest marguerite appearedpregnant a circumstance that now first presenteditself after a cessation of ten yearsthe morning after the accident and disclosure of hectori went to pisa determined to consult with the marchesefilosanto elder brother of the unfortunate andrea whowas probably more accurately acquainted with the italiancharacter than myself and understood the shades of thatcharacter as they were modified in the particular territoryin which i resided the marchese was a man universallyadmired for subtlety of reasoning vigorousness of comprehensionand refinement of taste in the structure of hismind he was scarcely an italian he had resided severalyears in england and was the intimate friend of henryhoward earl of surrey who some time after fell a victimto the jealous tyranny of his native sovereign king henrythe eighth the marchese was frank generous and disinterestedand possessed more fully the affections of every onewithin the circle of his friendship than any other man i everknew he was of a sanguine temper always contemplatingthe world on its brightest side and from the generosityof his own heart incapable of crediting a distant dangeror of discerning the storm in the embryo cloud where itwas silently engenderingin the conference we held i was influenced too implicitlyby my consciousness of his integrity and the giganticpowers of his mind and did not sufficiently advert tothose peculiarities in his temper which i have now describedthe external facts with which the narrative of hector hadfurnished me i fully detailed to him as to my particularpursuits i contented myself with stating that i indulgedt travels of st leonfreely in the study of chemistry and was of those personsordinarily accounted visionaries who amused themselveswith the expectation of finding rhe philosopher's stonehaving heard my story to an end the marchese ridiculedmy apprehensions he saw nothing in the facts thatalarmed me but a cowardly superstition whose utmost flightreached no higher than the shooting a dog and a squabblebetween a boisterous rustic and a servant too acutely sensitivefor the reputation of his master he assured methat the days of such superstition as i contemplated werelong since past and that his countrymen less deserved theimputation than any others as living at the very centreand source of catholic imposition they saw deeper into themystery and were not exposed to the advantage which distancepossesses for augmenting our reverence he expatiatedwith great eloquence on the vice of a suspicioustemper a spirit of alarm and continual apprehensionlike the jealousy of lovers he said made the meat it fedon it brooded over plots that had no existence but in thewanderings of a disturbed imagination it was continuallyinterrupting the quiet of its owner and the tranquillity ofsociety and for the sake of avoiding imaginary evilsoften plunged into such as were real he advised me togo home and be contented he recommended to me toclear up the clouds of my mind and cultivate a lightheart a cheerful temper and a generous confidence in thehonest sympathies of mankind in fine he bade me continuemy pursuits avoid eclat and trust in his sagacitythat no ill consequences would ensuethe remonstrances of the marchese filosanto led me tosuspect that i had been idly credulous i had too easilyparticipated the feelings and apprehensions of a poor uninstructednegro and had suffered the secret griefs thatbrooded in my heart to discolour my perceptions andaggravate the features of circumstances in themselves triflingor indifferent i began to be half ashamed of thegloominess of my conceptions i could not alas followthe advice of the marchese as to the cheerfulness of myheart but i could exert myself to prevent my presentmelancholy from disfiguring to me every thing i saw thetravels op st leon influence exercised over my conceptions by persons of eminentintellect has always been great not that the judgmenti formed of the powers of my own mind was peculiarlyhumble but i reasoned thus perhaps the person iconsult is as well informed in the subject under considerationas i am in that case his decision is as fully entitledto attention as my own and thus without cowardly selfcontempton my part the general balance of the argumentwas materially altered perhaps without being on thewhole my superior he may be more competent to this particularquestion in either case my idea of its merits becameperceptibly modified i never listened to the sentimentsof a man of talents when they differed from my ownunless where he was evidently visionary and irrationalwithout being shaken as to the credit due to my own viewof the subjectsuch then was the effect produced on me by the marchese'sexpostulation i shook off my apprehensions andlaughed at my fears i was ashamed of the want of gallantrythat had possessed me when i meditated flightfrom so trivial a menace i concluded that dangers particularlysuch as arise from the irrational passions of a capriciousmultitude were increased when symptoms of apprehensiondiscovered themselves and abated when receivedwith neglect or repelled with a magnanimous serenitychapter xxviimeanwhile the unrelenting agostino was fixed in

several subsequentoccasions i found the manners of the populace alteredrespecting me they no longer viewed me with a sort ofreverential awe or fled my approach they insulted mewith their eyes they muttered curses upon me in a voicesufficiently audible to be understood they broke forth ingestures of abhorrence and derision they regarded mewith looks of ferocious hatred and when i had passed themtheir murmurs gradually swelled into shouts of triumphantcontumely these symptoms however were progressive jeach day became more odious and intolerable than the lastthey who have never been placed in a situation like minewill never be able to do justice to my grievance theywill perhaps say that the calamity i now endured was atrifling one and that a weak mind only can be elevated bythe acclamations and huzzahs of the multitude or depressedby their hisses and scorn i did not and i could not feelit so there is no pleasure more congenial to the humanheart than the approbation and

for the lives of mywife and children to the sagacity and presence of mind oftravels of st leon bernardin the servant of my early years my residencehad been the object against which the march of the

happinessdepended at present upon his concealment hectoryielded to his representations this accomplished bernardinnext assembled the gardener and one or two labourersin my employment who happened to be at hand andhaving furnished them with firearms stationed them atdifferent windows in the front of the house with thesepreparations when the mob arrived he resolutely told themthat he would fire on the first person that attempted to breakin they were staggered furious as they appeared themoment before this threat held them in awe they paradedtwo or three times round the house clattering theirarms and pouring out vehement execrations and thenwithdrew solemnly promising that they would return thefollowing night and level the house with the groundi no longer yielded the smallest degree of credit to theunsuspicious and confiding philosophy of the marchesefilosanto i sent off my wife and children before daybreakfor lucca determined to take shipping at the firstconvenient port and pass over into spain i was littlesolicitous for reasons with which the reader is already acquaintedabout my property and moveables i had no motiveto induce me to fetter and clog my retreat at this hourof peril and terror with a single article of rarity and pricemy furniture indeed was not splendid but it was handsomeand valuable and the indifference with which i resignedthe whole to the mercy of chance was a matter of somesurprise to the persons around me my servants offeredto defend my possessions at the peril of their lives but iperemptorily forbade it i would not even consent totheir taking away certain articles by way of appropriatingthem to their personal use i believed that if i admittedtravels of st leonasingle act of that sort i should find it no easy matter toset limits to their avidity and as i had determined totake none of my present servants with me the negro andbernardin excepted i feared that the apparent possession ofa single article that had been mine might hereafter markits proprietor a victim to the senseless rage of blindfoldsuperstition i could easily make up to these honest andfaithful dependants the injury they might sustain from theseeming severity of this order i determined to shut upmy house with all its present contents as joshua thecaptain of the jews drew a line of separation round theprofane possessions of achan and to leave the villagers ifso it seemed good to them to make of the whole a burntofferingto propitiate the wrath of their avenging divinitythe directions i issued being unhesitating and peremptorymet with a ready submission from all my other domesticshector only the mild and complying hector ofwhom obedience had hitherto appeared to constitute thevery soul met my commands with a resolute refusal thepresent distressed appearance of my fortunes seemed tohave worked the poor fellow's mind to a paroxysm of insanityhe considered himself as the sole author of mycalamity ile reviled himself in the bitterest terms ofcompunction and abhorrence the language which theagony of his soul forced from his lips was such as couldnot fail to impress upon my other servants a conviction ofthe justice of the imputations that were now brought againstus this however was of little importance i must at allevents have been contented to leave behind me in my presentneighbourhoods name loaded with the execrations ofreligious fanaticism hector imprecated upon himself athousand curses if so long as he continued to live the populaceshould lay hands upon a straw of my property hewould not move so much as an inch from the defence of myhouse he would either by preserving it expiate in somedegree the mischief in which he had involved me or fall andbe crushed to death in the midst of its ruins argumentsand expostulations were useless here his mind was workedup to too high a tone to be susceptible of the patience necessaryfor hearing or understanding any reasoning that wastravels of st leon addressed to him authority itself was of no avail forthe first and the last time he threw off the character of aservant and appeared obstinate selfwilled and ungovernableit was only by direct violence that he could be forcedfrom the spot i gave him in charge with the most strictorders not to suffer him to escape from their custody to twoof his fellowsthis business being despatched i went at the invitationof the marchese to a small cottage he possessed at no greatdistance from my own house its situation was so privateand retired that few persons knew or could perceive thatthere was any building on the spot here therefore i couldremain in the most perfect safety i felt myself unaccountablyimpelled to stay and witness the catastrophe of thetragedy i should not have been satisfied to continue inuncertainty as to what it would prove after all that hadpassed like the marchese i should have been apt to accusemyself of cowardice and a mind soured and degenerate ifthe mob had not put their threats in execution the marchesehimself was well pleased with my determination inthis respect he was not yet convinced that i had notpainted to myself a danger which had no adequate counterpartin the world of realitiesi had not long to wait the night had no sooner spreadan evencoloured and almost impervious veil over theworld than the marchese as if moved by a secret impulseto witness what he yet refused to believe came to me at thecottage he had scarcely arrived when he heard the confusedmurmurs and turbulence of the populace for wewere near enough to distinguish almost every thing asthey did not meet with the defence of the preceding eveningthe work they had undertaken was presently despatchedwe saw the flames ascend we recognised theshouts of infernal joy with which they witnessed the catastrophewhen the marchese beheld what till seen hewould never admit to be possible he burst out into a sort oftransport of misanthropy he exclaimed that no innocenceand no merit could defend a man from the unrelenting antipathyof his fellows he saw that there was a principlein the human mind destined to be eternally at war with travels of st leonprovement and science no sooner did a man devote himselfto the pursuit of discoveries which if ascertainedwould prove the highest benefit to his species than hiswhole species became armed against him the midnightoil was held to be the signal of infernal machinations thepaleness of study and the furrows of thought were adjudgedto be the tokens of diabolical alliance he saw in thetransactions of that night a pledge of the eternal triumphof ignorance over wisdom above all he regretted thathis countrymen his dear italians should for ever blot theirhonour and their character by such savage outragesthough myself the principal sufferer i was obliged to performthe part of the comforter and consoler and endeavourto calm the transport of agony that seized upon the susceptiblefilosanto he was astonished shocked and besidehimself i viewed the whole with the gloomy firmness ofa desperate resolutionthe worst event of this detested evening remains yetunrecorded even now i tremble while i attempt tocommit the story to my harmless paper so far as relatedto the mere destruction of my property i looked on with aphilosophical indifference i had no reason and i disdainedto regret the loss of that which i had it in mypower to repair in a moment i thought i had taken carethat no human life should be risqued upon this criticaloccasion but i was mistaken i learned the next morningwith anguish inexpressible that hector the negro ofthe prison of constance was no more he had eludedthe vigilance of his keepers no sooner was he at libertythen he hastened unknown to every one to die as he haddeclared he would in the defence of my house the mobhad burst into the house they seized him alive theydragged him out in the midst of them they insulted overhim as the special favourite of the infernal king theyinflicted on him every species of mockery and of torture they killed him joint by joint and limb by limb thepen drops from my lifeless handwhat right had i to make this man the victim of myidle and unhallowed pursuits what has the art andmultiplication of gold in it that should compensate thetravels op st leon destruction of so ingenuous so simplehearted so noble acreature if i had myself fallen into the hands of thepopulace it had been well i was a criminal worthy ofevery retribution they could inflict upon me some menperhaps will ask why i lamented so bitterly over so uncultivatedand uninformed an individual as this negrothere was however something so truly tragical in the fateto which this creature in his generosity and remorse devotedhimself that i believe for the moment i felt asharper pang in it than in the strange and extraordinaryloss of my only son or perhaps in the premature death ofmy beloved margueritechapter xxviiibefore the dawn of the succeeding morning i turned myface towards lucca i beheld the last cloud of minglingsmoke and flame ascend from the ashes of my villa theblaze sunk its materials were nearly consumed and ityielded an uncertain and fitful light only when i withdrewfrom being any longer the melancholy and heartwoundedspectator of the ruin i took an everlasting leave of themarchese i had been introduced to him under a friendlyaspect as the man who had had courage to perform thelast offices of humanity to his unfortunate brother andhe had conceived a warm affection for me the painfulnature of the catastrophe he had witnessed melted his heartand he earnestly pressed me to draw upon him for anysupplies i wanted or rather to receive from him a sumequivalent to the damage the superstition of his countrymenhad inflicted on me this i positively refused buti found it impossible to silence his importunity till isubmitted to the duplicity of promising that if i foundmyself reduced to any necessity i would not fail to applyto him it was in the very moment of our separationthat intelligence was brought me of the fate of hectorthe reader may imagine with how heavy a heart i set outon my journeyit travels of st leonlucca is about seventeen miles from the city of pisa from the place where i had spent the greater part of thismemorable night it was twenty the marchese made mepromise to take a serpentine and circuitous route the morecompletely to elude the possibility of future danger anadventure occurred to me in this passage with the relationof which i will not interrupt my narrative which preventedme from arriving at lucca till the noon of thefollowing day suffice it to say that it was of such anature that impatient as i was under my present extraordinarycircumstances to rejoin my family i should haveheld myself destitute of every atom of humanity if i hadnot submitted to this short delayshort as it was i found when i reached lucca thatmy evil genius had been busy to accumulate for me newmisfortunes marguerite and her daughters were whollyunknown in this place and the intelligence of the pisanriot having reached lucca in the course of the day it wasrelated to my wife as to a hearer unconcerned with all itshorrid circumstances and the calamitous fate of our generoushector by the hostess of the inn the rapidity of eventsduring the last part of our residence in the pisan territorywas such as to have obliged me to say little of the effectthey produced upon marguerite but the reader canscarcely be so inadvertent and unreflecting as not easily toimagine to himself that she felt them in the highest degreepainful and overwhelming this last blow was too muchmarguerite had been some months pregnant she wasimmediately seized with the pains of labour and deliveredof a dead child the first intelligence communicated tomeupon my arrival was that my wife was dyinglucca however did not witness the period of her existenceafter having continued for several days upon thevery extremity as it were between life and death shegrew perceptibly better and in a week more though in avery feeble state it became apparent that her case was notarapid one we agreed to proceed upon our spanishvoyage it appeared not improbable that the seaair mightbe found beneficial and the experiment was warmly recommendedby her physicians they were not howevertravels op st leon aware of the whole extent of her disorder during thevoyage her crisis returned with such malignant symptomsas scarcely to permit us the hope she would reach the landalive we debarked at barcelona on the th of april we had no sooner taken up our abode inthis city thanfully aware of the state of her disease she assembled herdaughters and poured forth to them without restraint thatflood of affection that ardent spirit of love by which shewas distinguished and elevated above every creature thatlived her mind was clear her intellectual powers werecomplete and entire the enthusiasm with which shenow expressed herself was not of that inconsiderate naturewhich should tend to make them feel with greater acutenessthe loss they were about to sustain it was brightunclouded and serene it was the eloquence as of a disembodiedspirit freed from the perturbation and alloy ofhuman passions she reminded them that they were sistersand exhorted each to fulfil the duties of a sister anda mother to the other two if wise and good they wouldbe happy in each other and their little association would beaschool preparing them for the more genuine and venerableduties for which nature had destined them her viewsof all human things were altered by her present situation onthe brink of the grave our reserves and misunderstandingshad wrung her heart but she forgave me thingswhich had lately appeared of the highest magnitude andmoment faded in the distance and mingled with the vulgarcrowd of human concerns which was now retiring fromher view she must again return she said to life before shecould again feel the passions and the interests of this pettyscene for the sake of her daughters she had lately desiredto live she was now reconciled and content to dieshe had formed the chain and link of connection betweenme and my girls perhaps it was better that we shouldburst our fetters and be free on the fourth day afterour arrival at barcelona marguerite expiredthere is nothing in the vast variety of objects whichthis wretched world presents to our view so dreadful anddistressing as the sight of one we have loved but who isnowno more i saw these eyes beheld the lifeless corseu travels of st leonof marguerite great god of heaven what is man and of what are we made within that petty frame residedfor years all that we worship for there resided allthat we know and can conceive of excellence that heartis now still within the whole extent of that frame thereexists no thought no feeling no virtue it remains nolonger but to mock my sense and scoff at my sorrow torend my bosom with a woe complicated matchless andinexpressible the cheek is pale and livid the eyes aresunk and circled with blackness corruption and ruinhave already seized their prey and turned it into horrordraw for heaven's sake draw the pall over those lifelessfeatures bury bury them deep in the bowels of theearth let not my imagination follow them into thechambers of the grave and dwell amidst pestilential dampsand all the series of destruction let me recollect all thatmarguerite was as she lived her numerous accomplishmentsher unparalleled virtues ay in all the magnitudeand wealth of their detail for that is a divine andcelestial madness but let me not recollect her as i saw heronthe bier lest i become raving and blaspheme ii have no power to talk of the situation in which i wasnow placed and the reader must therefore explain it forhimself if he can i never loved but once i neverloved but marguerite all other affection is stillness andice compared with this this is the great crisis of myhistory the gap between life and death the gulf that cutme oft for ever from every thing that deserves the name ofhuman such was the legacy of the stranger my son anexile myself publicly arraigned as a murderer the unmeritedand tragical death of hector the premature andselfderiving loss of the better half of my soul whowould have believed that this envied gift would in lessthan two years have thus dreadfully changed the face ofmy affairs and destroyed every thing that composed thehappiness of my life after some delay in this wretched and illomened town ofbarcelona such it has ever since appeared to my thoughtswe proceeded to madrid the reader will give me creditwhen i tell him that however eager i had lately felt totravels of st leon exhibit my magnificence and my wealth i had no sucheagerness now i speak no more of the character of margueritej i attempt not to compose her panegyric thestory of her life is the best record of her virtues her defectsif defects she had drew their pedigree from rectitudeof sentiment and perception from the most generous sensibilityfrom a heart pervaded and leavened with tendernessa simple stone in the western aisle of the greatchurch at barcelona records her personal and her familyname with this single addition the preserver of herfamily in poverty and ruin the victim of her disconsolateand repentant husband's unhallowedwealthbut dismissing for ever and henceforth consigning toinviolate silence her excellencies could i avoid feelingthat i could never again form a similar or indeed anyreal union so long as i existed being now indeed morethan forty years of age having spent near twenty of thatforty in a most enviable wedlock and being blessed with asufficiently numerous offspring it may be thought perhapsi might be contented but without discussing the proprietyof such a maxim as it relates to the species ingeneral it must be recollected in my case that my youthwas to be recommenced by a perpetual series of renewalsi never gave credit to that axiom of a sickly sensibilitythat it is a sacrilege in him who has been engaged in onecordial and happy union ever to turn his thoughts toanother much more reasonable than this is the indiandoctrine that the survivor ought to leap into the flamesand perish upon the funeral pyre of the deceased whilewe live it is one of our most imperious duties to seekour happiness he that dedicates his days to an endlesssorrow is the worst and most degraded of suicides it isan important question in the economy of human life up towhat age we should allow ourselves to contract engagementsto a wife and a probable offspring but separatelyfrom this consideration i should hold that in many caseshe who entered into a second marriage by that actionyielded a pure and honourable homage to the manes of thefirst but from genuine marriage i was henceforth foru travels of st leonever debarred an immortal can form no true and realattachment to the insect of an hourmourning a depressing and speechless regret was yetthe inmate of our house grief does not commonly lay astrong and invincible hold of us in the morning of ourdays and though the temper of julia was perhaps at herage the most tender and susceptible i ever knew even shewho was now in her seventeenth year reaped the benefitof that elasticity which in early life is the portion ofhumanity nothing material occurred to us in the firstthree months of our residence in madrid it was impossiblefor any one to be surrounded with a more lovelyand blooming family than i wasyet from happiness i was immeasurably distant exclusivelyof my recent and in every sense irreparable lossmy mind was full of dark and gloomy forebodings ifeared not for myself but i had an unconquerable alarmand apprehension for my children my youngest was butten years of age the eldest was not seventeen sweettender blossoms that the cruelty and hardness of mankindmight so easily blight and that required a concurrence offavourable circumstances to ripen into all they were capableof becoming when i recollected what had happened inthe course of the last two years i could not flatter myselfthat our misfortunes were at an end or that i had not tospeak moderately many fierce trials yet to encounter iseemed like the farfamed tree of java to be destined toshelter only to destroy and to prove a deadly poison towhatever sought its refuge under my protecting branchesin this melancholy frame of mind the last words of myadored marguerite passed and repassed ten thousand timesthrough my recollection she had formed the chain andlink of connection between me and my girls perhaps itwas better that we should burst our fetters and be freewhatever she had said was sacred to the present temperof my imagination her last behest i would have died toexecute the idea contained in the sentence i have justrepeated was ambiguous and obscure rather hinted thanexpressed but was it worthy of the less attention becauseits author with her usual gentleness and sweetnesstravels of st leon had modestly suggested an advice instead which she waswell entitled to have done of prescribing a will i determinedto part with my children that i might no longerbe to them a source of corroding misery and affliction ibelieved that the cloud that now oppressed me was transitoryi seemed pursued for the present by a malignantgenius but a man endowed as i was with unboundedwealth and immortal vigour cannot easily be reduced todespair when the tide of my prosperity should unfoldits rich and ample current i might easily communicate ofits bounty to my daughters if i parted with them nowi did not lose them as i had perhaps lost their brother foreveri could turn to a particular point and say therelies my soul i could cast my eye upon a projectionof the globe and put my finger upon their residencewherever i wandered whether i were plunged in a dungeonor mounted a throne my heart like the mariner'sneedle would tremble towards that point as its cynosurei had still something to love something to pant for somethingto dream about and be happyhaving ruminated insatiably upon the last expressionsof marguerite having formed my commentary and fixedmy predilection i recollected a person then a youngwoman upon my paternal estate for whom my wife hadconceived a remarkable friendship she was the daughterof a peasant her birth had been low and her educationconfined but she had taste she had discretion she hadintegrity i think i may add she had genius as margueritehad discovered her merits and distinguished herfrom her equals she had been of great use to this extraordinaryrustic in unfolding her mind and guiding herpropensities this was not so much a matter of deliberateand meditated purpose in la dame du seigneur it roseout of the circumstances of their situation they werealmost of an age and marguerite frequently invited herto be the associate of her studies and amusements marianathat was her name did not perhaps resemble my wifeconsiderably in her features but her stature was the sameher complexion and the colour of her hair the similarityin carriage and gesture mariana having never had an travels of st leonopportunity of contemplating the accomplishments sheadmired in any one but madame de st leon was stillmore striking there were points indeed in which nohuman creature could compare with marguerite the expressiveand flexible tone of her voice and those cadenceswhich sprung from and communicated to every susceptiblehearer the divinest sensibility one of the unhappy consequencesof our exile from the bordelois was the misfortunesof mariana her father had fallen to decay torelieve his distress she had contracted a marriage not ofsentiment and predilection but with a man who had promisedher that her father should never come to want thismarriage had been unhappy the husband was a prodigaland a profligate a period of seven years however deliveredher from her egyptian bondage she had butlately become a widow and the prudence and integrity ofher conduct had rendered this alliance which to manywomen would have proved a rock of destruction an additionalsource of honour and respect mariana at thedeath of her husband had no children she had buried herfather she was consequently entirely aloneit was this woman i fixed upon as the protector of mydaughters i was better pleased with the meanness of herextraction than i should have been with one of the highborndescendants of the houses of st leon or damvillehad it been my fortune to have had in the female line anynear relations on either side my daughters were no longerchildren they were singularly prudent considerate andunimpeachable in their conduct and propensities theywanted a protector in the eye of the world it was desirablefor them that they should have an adviser but i shouldhave been grieved and mortified to give them a dictatori wrote to mariana chabot communicating my projectand requesting her to give us the meeting at st vizier onthe frontiers of france she was delighted with the officei tendered to her acceptance and readily consented to everythingi required i conducted my daughters to the placeof rendezvous without imparting to them the design bywhich i was actuated i believed that they would of theirown motion conceive a partiality for the friend of theirtravels of st leon mother i was not deceived in my prognostic the meetingwas an interesting one the eyes of mariana overflowedat meeting after so long an interval the husband and progenyof the dearest and most revered friend she had everknown the mourning we wore reminded her how latelyher incomparable patroness had been committed to thegrave my girls were struck with the resemblance ofmariana to their mother accident had prevented us fromcultivating almost any intimate connections out of our ownfamily from the period of our exile my girls had thereforenever met with a person who approached in any degree sonear their mother in accomplishments in skill in turn ofthinking and opinion mariana came up to my warmesthopes as a protector and companion for my children herunhappy marriage by concentrating her thoughts and expectationsin herself had perhaps rendered her more exemplaryin carriage and more elevated in sentiment than shewould ever have been without itat st vizier i passed myself for monsieur palmer theguardian of the orphan heiresses of st leon it fortunatelyhappened that my paternal estate was at this timeupon sale i determined to become the purchaser and tosettle my girls in the scene of their nativity i procuredan agent and despatched him with an ample commissionfor that purpose having adjusted this point i resolved tomake a tour with my daughters through languedoc dauphineand the provinces usually known by the denominationof the south of france i wished to familiarise them tothe society of madame chabot and to assist them in discerningher merits under a variety of points of view iasked them whether they would not be delighted to obtainher as a companion who might assist and conduct them insuch points as only a woman of understanding and experienceis competent to they every one of them listenedto the idea with pleasureat length i received the information that the purchase ofst leon was completed and i proceeded to the critical disclosurethat my daughters were on the point of beingseparated from their father they listened to the communicationwith astonishment and terror they had entered travels op st leonsuccessively into the feelings of their deceased mother andi am well persuaded felt a less ardent attachment to myperson than they had done at the cottage of the lake ofconstance but culpable and criminal as i had been iwas not destitute of every virtue and they could not extinguishin themselves the respect they had so long entertainedfor me habit has a resistless empire over thehuman mind and when we reflect with how much reluctancewe consent to the removal of a tree or a hedge tothe sight of which we have been accustomed it will not bewondered at that my daughters could not calmly think of socomplete a separation from their father the impressionof their mother's death was yet green and to lose me wasto become orphans a second time but i had fully meditatedmy plan and was peremptory that i mightwithhold from them no advantage it was in my power toconfer i gave them bernardin for their superintendingbailiff and steward of their property our parting was notless painful and melancholy than its occasion was extraordinaryand its mode uncommon it took place at thetown of montaubani saw my dear children set forward on their journey andi knew not that i should ever behold them more i wasdetermined never again to see them to their injury and icould not take to myself the consolation on such a dayin such a month or even after such a lapse of years i willagain have the joy to embrace them in a little whilethey were out of sight and i was alone the reader willperhaps agree with me that no man had more exquisitelyenjoyed the dearest ties of society than i had and thatperhaps few men were ever better formed to enjoy themthis complete and dreadful separation this stroke thatseemed to cut me off abruptly from every thing mostvaluable that the earth contains was not the result of anyof the ordinary necessities of human life still less was itthe dictate of alienation or indifference no it was thepure effect of love of a love so strong complete and uncontrollableas inflexibly to refuse every thing that could beinjurious to its objects i own i could not thus haveparted with marguerite her idea was mingled with thetravels of st leon vital springs of my existence and scarcely any power lessresistless than death could have made me consent to passan entire day without her society but then it is to beconsidered that my daughters were in the morning of life their hopes were untarnished their prospects not obscuredby a single cloud and that the crime would probably havebeen greater obstinately to have made them the partners ofmy misfortunes and disgrace there are persons who willregard this passage in my history as culpable and the testimonyof a cold and unsusceptible heart i contemplateit even at this distance of time as the noblest and mostvirtuous effort of my life and a thousand circumstanceshave occurred since to induce me to congratulate myselfthat i had the courage to achieve my purposechapter xxixnineteen years had now elapsed from the day that hadwitnessed my union with marguerite de damville in allthat time had never been alone alone in a certain senseindeed i had stood at paris in the period that had led tomy exile and at soleure in that which immediately succeededit in each case i was solitary and my solitudewas unhappy but my unhappiness was then in a certainsense spontaneous my solitude was a luxury in which ifelt myself impelled to indulge he that has experiencedboth will readily acknowledge the extreme difference betweenthe misery we embrace and the misery from whichwe shrink with abhorrence and loathing i relinquishedin the former instances my dearest connections my properpost and situation but i felt that i could return to theone and resume the other at pleasure i repeat it thereforethen i had not been alone and now i was alone thesame motive which in this instance made me cut myself off'from my daughters that i might not be the cause of theirmisery forbad me to be the parent of a future offspringupon whom i might entail similar misfortune tell me travels of st leonthen was i not alone i recollected the words of thestranger wrung from him by the excess of his misery at thesummerhouse of the lake alone alone friendlessfriendless i began to penetrate the enigma of hishistoryi fixed my daughters with an ample revenue in thechateau of st leon i repurchased for them all mypaternal property i waited some time at montauban tohear of the event of my project and their final settlementi learned with pleasure that they found their situationpeaceful easy and reputable i enjoined them that theyshould speak and think of me as dead i led them to supposewhen i left montauban that i should set out uponan extensive tour that i should traverse the indus and theganges and penetrate into the furthest extremities of theeast how uncommon how pitiable a fate i becameprematurely dead to my country and my race because iwas destined never to die the first sensation i derivedfrom their prosperity as i have already said was pleasure my second was that which the devil might have felt whenhe entered paradise for the seduction of our first parentsi contemplated with some degree of malignant envy a happinessof which it was little probable i should ever partakelet me not be censured for this let any man put himselfin my situation and say whether the pleasure he feels atcontemplating the separated happiness of those he loves benot a mingled sensation with heavy heart i sought againthe road of madridthough my spirits underwent an extreme depression idetermined not to desert myself or the advantages i hadpurchased at so inestimable a price i exerted myself toshake off my lethargy and rouse the faculties of my souli refused to give way to omens of evil portent and resolvedto see what might yet be made of my endowments thereis no misfortune that has not in it some slight mixture ofgood my being now alone and detached from every relativetie left me at liberty to pursue my projects with abolder enterprise the mistake of which i accused myselfin the former instance was the entering too precipitatelyinto the exercise of the gifts of the stranger before i hadtravels op st leon properly measured my strength and investigated the useand application of my tools i had suffered sufficientlyfrom the past uncertainty and irresoluteness of my marchi determined as far as human precaution could secure itsends to encounter no more misfortunes to subject myself tono further miscarriages but to take care that henceforth thetide of my pursuits should move smoothly onward i dedicatedthe six months immediately succeeding my separationfrom my daughters to the joint contemplation of moralsand natural philosophy i was resolved to ascertain thesimplest mode of manufacturing wealth the wisest methodsfor lulling the suspicions and controlling the passions ofmankind and the true science of the use of riches alas i had in the sequel frequent occasions to confess thatthough i had fortuitously entered into possession of theleading secrets of natural magic i was a mere tyro in thescience of man at least in the degree in which the exerciseof these secrets required the possession of itnothing material occurred to interrupt the occupations ofthe winter my apathy intellectual activity palsy ofthe heart went evenly forward i made no acquaintance i was a mere spectator of the busy scenes that passedaround me i was resolved not to entangle myself withrashly formed connections and it will commonly be foundthat he whose contemplations are principally employed uponsome secret and guarded hoard of reflection has little propensityto communicate upon idle and indifferent mattersa slight incident indeed disturbed me for a few daysduring this interval but it passed away and for the presenti thought of it no more during the festival of christmasit happened that i felt an inclination to be the spectatorof a celebrated bullfight that was exhibited before the emperorand his court for the most part i was studious ofprivacy i therefore felt the less scruple in indulging thisunusual caprice at the commencement of the spectaclei was attentive only to the exhibition i was delightedwith the form and beauty of the animals with the freedomand grandeur of their motion with the terrible energy oftheir assault and repulse it was not long however beforemy eye was transiently caught by an individual who sat in travels op st leonagallery at no great distance and who seemed to view meattentively his figure bespoke some degree of refinementbut his eye was fiery malicious and savage presentlyhowever i turned again towards the area and thought ofhim no more some time after by mere accident i lookedtowards the same gallery and observed this man still in anattitude to examine me it seemed as if he had not removedhis eyes from me during the whole interval thiswas repeated three or four times without knowing whyi became anxious and uneasy i had a confused feelingthat i had seen the man before but whether in franceswitzerland or italy i could not tell i experienced thatsort of disagreeable sensation from looking at his face whicharises in the mind from an association of the object presentwith some mischief or suffering that was contemporarywith its being perceived in a preceding instance i am nowpersuaded that this man was one of the multitude to whomi had addressed myself from the bench on the hill a shorttime before my flight from pisa and that he was amongthe most eager to interrupt and molest me but he wasapparently a spaniard by birth and i could not at thistime developed the mystery that hung about his featuresfinding that i could neither rid myself of his curious andwatchful observation nor of the disturbance it gave me iwithdrew from the gallery where i had hitherto been sittingand removed to another gallery on the opposite side of thearea about half an hour after looking accidentally roundi saw this very man at my elbow i then accosted himwith the enquiry do you know me sir to which heimmediately returned with a pure castilian accent nosenor he then began to be more reserved in his attentionto me without however entirely withdrawing itas soon as the entertainment was over i went away andsaw no more of my spaniard i began to tax myself withpusillanimity in suffering so insignificant an incident todisturb me a few days after however i suddenly lightedupon him in the street he was talking to three or fourof his countrymen and in the progress of his discoursefrequently pointed to me i could now perceive somethingparticularly hostile and ferocious in his countenance thetravels of st leon first impulse i felt was that i would no longer suffer theunquietness and anxiety the sight of him produced in mebut would go up to him and force him to an explanationi believed however that in the temper he indicated thiscould not be done without involving myself in a quarreland i thought it wiser to endeavour to conquer in silencean unreasonable sensation i therefore passed on he immediatelybroke from his company and attempted to followme this i determined not to endure i laid my handon my sword with a peremptory look and waved to him todesist his countenance then assumed an air of diabolicalmalignity he shook his head furiously and turned downanother street a strange sort of animosity this betweentwo persons utter strangers to each other and which hadas yet not deigned to express itself by a word but suchis the world we hate we know not why we are readyto cut each other's throats because we do not like the turnof a feature or the adjustment of a swordknot prejudiceparty difference of countries difference of religions and athousand wild chimeras of fanaticism or superstition arecontinually arming us against a man of whose virtues andqualities we are ignorant and into whose benevolent or evilintentions we disdain to enquirei saw this spaniard but once more it was as i was onthe point of entering the house a part of which i occupiedi was particularly mortified at this circumstance it wasplain the man entertained for whatever reason a determinedanimosity against me and i was grieved to furnishhim with that advantage for injuring me which consistedin being acquainted with the place of my residence iwould have turned away and gone down the street but ihad too fully marked my design of entering the housebefore i reconnoitered my enemy the displeasure i feltwas so unaccountably great that it was with difficulty mycourage got the better of it and i determined not to changethe place of my abode in a short time however as i havealready said i thought of this incident no more that itshould have disturbed and unhinged me in the degree that'it had done even for a moment was a thing i could notaccount for had the calamities in which the legacy ofx travels op st leonthe stranger involved me converted me in so short a timefrom a knight and a soldier into a character of that morbidtimidity as to tremble at every shadow or is there insome human countenances a fascination a sort of mysterioussympathy and presentiment that makes us cower and quailwhenever we meet their eyebeams several weeks now passed away and i had nearly forgottenall the circumstances of this seemingly foolish storywhen in a little excursion i chanced to make from madridto a place about twelve miles distant i was overtaken uponthe road by a cavalier of respectable appearance who presentlytook occasion to enter into conversation with me heexplained to me several of the objects that presented themselveson either side told the names of the different nobilityand grandees who occupied the villas we saw and sometimesentered into the particulars of their history i at first gavelittle encouragement to this communicative traveller butthere was something so polite in his manner and intelligentin his discourse that i could not prevail upon myself totreat him with rudeness or disrespect after having talkedfor some time upon indifferent topics he led to the generalstate of literature in europe few subjects could appearless dangerous than this as there were few upon which ifelt myself better qualified to converse by degrees i threwoff some of my original reserve and i found my companionwell informed and ingenious lively in his manner andpertinent in his remarksby this time the unknown having discovered that i hadonly come from madrid for a day's relaxation invited himselfto dine with me at my inn i departed from myestablished system of conduct on this occasion and admittedhis overture after dinner he gave me some account ofhimself and his family and seemed to expect from me asimilar explicitness i was less pleased with him in thisparticular than i had been with his frank and undesigningconversation on the road strictly speaking however theexpectation implied was only a breach of politeness i hadno reason to suppose that he foresaw it to be particularlyoffensive to me observing my backwardness he immediatelychanged the subject presently he remarked thattravels of st leon by my physiognomy and accent he perceived i was afrenchman and asked me if i had known corneliusagrippa who died about twelve years before at grenoble ianswered in the negative the unknown then enteredinto a warm eulogium of the talents of agrippa inveighedagainst the illiberal treatment he had experienced in consequenceof his supposed proficiency in magic and spokewith great asperity of the priests and inquisitors who hadbeen his persecutors i became attentive watchful andsuspicious he went on to expatiate upon the praises ofthe art magic which nothing he said but the jealousy ofchurchmen had brought into disrepute affirmed that ithad been treated with respect and counted illustrious bythe ancients in the instance of pythagoras apologiesthanes and others and expressed a great desire to becomea student of the art himself this kind of discourse mademe repent that i had been drawn in so far as to sit downwith this unknown and admit him as my companion ofthe day during the whole time he was the principalspeaker sometimes he paused with a seeming desire tohear my sentiments but i had now formed my resolutionand gave him no encouragement presently after i calledfor my horse i should have observed that his servantwho followed him engaged in conversation with mine atthe same time that the dialogue began between their mastersseeing me about to depart the unknown motioned as if toaccompany me upon this i became seriouscc senor caballero said i i have now had the pleasureof your company to dinner i am going home andhave the honour to bid you farewell it is neither my dispositionnor the habit of the grave and dignified nationamong whom i at present reside to form permanent acquaintancesupon casual rencounters you will not thereforethink i violate the hospitality for which i am indebtedto them if i intimate to you my desire to return aloneall this i said with the grave and formal tone becominga spaniard and the unknown had nothing to reply it wasevident however that my dryness chagrined him and heeven muttered words of resentment between his teeth icould observe now a degree of hostility and fury in hisx travels op st leoncountenance which remarkably contrasted with the pliancyand obligingness of his preceding demeanour i took nonotice however of these circumstances and rode away ihave since had sufficient reasons to convince me that thesetwo persons whose story but for that explanation may appearto the reader exceedingly frivolous were the one aninformer and the other a spy of the holy inquisition theman who had seen me at pisa had his imagination terrifiedand his superstition set in arms by all that he had heard ofme in that place and thought he could not perform a moremeritorious work than by giving intelligence to the fatherswhat sort of person had taken refuge in the metropolisof this most catholic kingdom it was with this view hehad watched me and at length by an accident he deemedpeculiarly fortunate lodged me in my proper habitationhaving given in his denunciation my travelling companionwas next fastened on me by the contrivance and zeal of thefathers inquisitors he was a familiar of the holy officeand it is well known that persons of the fairest prospectsand most polite education in spain are led by their religiousimpressions to place a pride in performing menial and evenperfidious offices in the service of the inquisition thekind of dishonour i put upon him in parting though of anature he could not openly resent i fear conspired with hiszeal for god's and the church's honour to induce him torelate a story concerning me more modelled by the bitternessof his personal feelings than distinguished by a regardto truthsuch was the snare woven and drawing close round meon all sides for my destruction i was made uneasy bythe rencounter of the traveller but by no means aware ofthe whole extent of the mischief that impended over mewhen i came to retrace point by point the discourse hehad held i could not conceive that the turn it had takenoriginated in accident i perceived with no little grief ofheart and concern that i was known it was howevernecessary that i should reflect maturely upon the conductto be pursued by me i ought not gratuitously to exposemyself to danger but then on the other hand it is apoint of general wisdom and was particularly incumbent intravels of st leon qmy extraordinary circumstances not to suffer vigilance todegenerate into restless anxiety it would be easy for meif i were not strictly on my guard continually to find foodfor suspicion and to surround myself with imaginary plotsand dangers this was a vice that i was willing enoughto pity in others but there was no character that i morecordially disdained for myself there was none morepointedly in opposition to that gallant generous confidingspirit which had distinguished those military heroes of mynative soil who had been the exclusive object of my earliestadmiration and whom in my present dejected and desertedsituation i still desired to resemble when i cameto reflect i easily perceived that this vice was particularlyallied to a life of solitude and that he who is cut off fromthe genuine and happy connections of husband father andfriend is of all men most liable in their absence to conjureup for himself the unnatural intercourse and reciprocationsof hostility it was thus that i artificially reconciled myselfto my situation and obstinately closed my eyes uponthose equivocal demonstrations of danger which from timeto time were presented to my viewchapter xxxsuch was the state of my mind when it happened onegloomy evening in the latter end of march that my valetannounced to me three gentlemen who were come to visitme it was strange i had no visitors i indulged norelaxation but that of the street and of public places doyou know who they are said i i accidentally lookedup and saw paleness and terror written in his countenancehe had not however time to reply before they burst intothe room they were alguazils of the inquisition theytold me their errand was to conduct me to the holy officei submitted and accompanied them it was alreadydark they put me into a litter with the curtains drawnand then arranged themselves in silence one on each sidex travels of st leonwhile one brought up the rear i was taken by surprise nothing could be further from my expectation than such anevent as we passed along i ruminated with myself onthe line of conduct it was incumbent on me to pursue tomake an immediate experiment of the fidelity of my guideswas a doubtful attempt if for want of time and the opportunityof a tranquil hearing i miscarried with them thetrial would be converted into evidence against me if isucceeded i had then to escape out of spain in the centreof which i now was from the hostility of a tribunal whichwas said to surpass all the tribunals on the face of the earthin activity and vigilance i knew of nothing that thefathers of the inquisition could have against me i hadlived in the most entire seclusion and i could defyany one to report a single action of mine since i had enteredspain to my prejudice i had been wholly occupiedwith melancholy reflections on the past and solitary inventionsand devices which i purposed to bring forward for thefuture i determined not to live for ever the slave of feari believed that the best method for defeating a danger inmany cases was undauntedly to encounter it and i didnot imagine that i could have a more favourable opportunityfor that purpose than the present i had heard muchindeed of the terrors of the inquisition but a generous andliberal spirit lends no very attentive ear to horrors the triteand vulgar rumour of which only has reached him i disdainedto be blown down with a breath i believed thatthe inquisition itself would not venture to proceed criminallyagainst a man against whom nothing criminal hadbeen alleged in every event i believed it would never betoo late to have recourse to my peculiar prerogativesupon entering the prison of the inquisition i was firstconducted to a solitary cell it is not my intention to treatof those particulars of the holy office which are alreadyto be found in innumerable publications i have no pleasurein reviving the images of this sojourn of horrors iknow it is unreasonable to despise a man for the miseriesand wretchedness he has endured but i know that such isthe human heart and i will not expose myself to be scoffedat and trampled upon for my misfortunes i found myselftravels op st leon under the necessity while in the inquisition of submittingto that most profligate of all impositions an oath of secrecyas to what had seen and what i had suffered and whatevermay be the strict morality of such an obligation i willnot ambitiously thrust myself forward in violation of it iwill restrict the story i have to relate to the peculiaritiesthat characterised my case and enter as little as possibleinto the general policy of this frontier intrenchment ofthe christian faithwhen i was brought up to be interrogated i was assailedwith innumerable questions the obvious purport ofwhich was as much as possible to extort from me evidenceof every kind that might be injurious to my cause theobject of the inquisition is to defend our holy mother thechurch from whatever might defile her sanctity and whitenessevery thing that calls into question the truth of herdoctrines that pollutes and turns from their original purposeany of her ordinances or that implies commerce and leaguewith the invisible enemy of saints it is its peculiar provinceto investigate the fathers are therefore particularly cautiousthat they may not by confining their questions toomuch to a single object preclude themselves from the chanceof discovering danger under all the forms it may assumeit is presumed that he who is a corrupt member of thechurch of christ in one point is unsound and unfaithful inothersthe inquisitor who examined me first demandedwhether i were informed for what cause i was broughtbefore that tribunal whether i did not find myself ableto conjecture the nature of my offence whether i did notknow the sort of crimes for which men were detained inthat prison he then desired me to recollect myself andconsider whether i were not conscious of offence againstthe holy catholic church whether i had never assertedor maintained any doctrine contrary to what motherchurch asserts and maintains whether i had never tomy knowledge defiled any of the ordinances of god orapplied things sacred to unholy and profane purposeswhether i had never invocation the devil whether ihad never held any commerce or entered into any leaguex travels op st leonwith the enemy of saints whether i had never performedor sought to perform preternatural and miraculous acts byunholy means whether i had never vexed or sought tovex those against whom i had enmity by secret and forbiddenarts whether i had never resided in countries theinhabitants of which were heretics and whether i had neverlistened to their discourses and arguments whether wheni inhabited such countries i had never assisted at the celebrationof divine ordinances performed by heretics or in aform which holy church disapproves or condemns finding that he could gain nothing upon me by thesegeneral interrogatories the inquisitor next descended toparticulars he enquired concerning the incidents of mypisan story which having first assured myself from thetrain of his questions that some representation of that unfortunateaffair had reached his ear i willingly related tothe same extent that i had previously done to the marchesefilosantohe then proceeded to a great number of questions thesource of which is to be traced to the commonly receivednotions respecting sorcerers and necromancers they wereso artfully contrived and so large in their scope that it wasnot easy to guess whether they related to any particular accusationalleged against me or were formed entirely ongeneral principles yet some of them were so minute soconnected and arranged so perfectly in series that i couldnot but believe they were an echo of the calumnies inventedagainst me at pisa of which however as i had never collectedany regular and detailed account i could not accuratelytrace the influence on the present occasionthe inquisitor demanded of me whether i had neverseen or held conversation with any supernatural being orthe spirit of a man departed whether i had never practiseddiabolical arts to raise the dead whether i hadnever had a familiar in the form of some insect domesticanimal or reptile he was particularly subtle and copiousin his questions respecting the history of my unfortunatedog endeavouring to surprise me in some slip or contradictionin what i affirmed on the subject he asked whetheri had never assumed a form different from my real oneeither a different age and appearance or a different speciestravels of st leonof animal whether i had never hy the agency ofmy demon inflicted sickness convulsionfits or death whether i had never caused the mortality of cattlewhether i had not the power of being in two places atonce whether i had never been seen riding through theair whether i had never been wounded in my absenceby a blow aimed at my astral spirit or apparition whetheri had never possessed books of conjuration or the art magic whether it had never happened to me that an indifferentperson indiscreetly perusing a spell or incantation in mypossession had been maimed or killed by the spirits he hadunfeignedly evoked a further object particularly pursued in my interrogatorywas the detection of my property and the questions constructedfor this purpose were uncommonly artful andmultiplied the inquisitor told me that the holy officewas by the nature of its institution the guardian and administratorof every person that fell under its animadversionshut up he said as i must be during the pendencyof my cause and separated from the rest of mankind iwas wholly incapable of superintending my worldly affairswhich unless they were properly looked into might in theinterval be materially injured i ought therefore implicitlyand without reserve to refer myself in this point to thecare of the fathers if my innocence were established ashehoped and earnestly prayed to the mother of god andthe saints of jesus might ultimately happen i should findthe holy office a faithful and qualified steward if on thecontrary i should be proved a heretic and an alien to themost high i ought then to rejoice in the beneficent interferenceof the fathers who by dedicating my wealth toconsecrated purposes would mitigate in the eye of the justjudge of heaven and earth the duration or fierceness of mypunishments in a future world the inquisitor had apparentlyheard various reports of my riches and was inexpressiblychagrined that he should be found so unskilfula member of his profession as not to be able to extort fromme a full confession on that head after having employedevery artifice of menace and terror after having endeavouredto soothe and cajole me by blandishments and persuasionand finding all his expedients fruitless he poured travels of st leonupon me the full storm of his indignation he said itwas apparent that i was dealing disingenuously and fraudulentlywith the delegated guardians of religion j it wasimpossible that the expenditure i was well known more orless to have incurred could be supported without considerablefunds and my evident duplicity and concealment inthis point must be regarded as a full confirmation of everycrime my accusers had alleged against mein the course of my examinations the inquisitor whoquestioned me gave himself the trouble of entering into afull vindication of the tribunal of which he was a memberhe said that every thing that was valuable to mankindnot only in a future state but also in the present dependedupon preserving in full vigour and strength the sacred institutionsof the christian faith and that those who wereendowed with powers sufficient for that purpose would bein the highest degree inexcusable in the sight of god ifthey did not vigilantly and inflexibly maintain the exertionof those powers it was an egregious mistake of selfwilledand opinionated men to suppose that the maintenance ofour holy religion was sufficiently provided for by the clearnessof its evidence it was no less dangerous to pretendthat the stability and duration of the church of christmight be confided to the providence of god providenceacts by human means and it was presumptuous for thosewho neglected the means to trust that they should neverthelesssee the end adequately secured why had providencethought proper to generate an alliance between churchand state and to place the powers and authority of humansociety in the hands of the adherents of the christian faith magistrates and governments were thus made the vicars ofheaven and great would be their condemnation if theyneglected the trust reposed in them the great adversaryof mankind was incessantly watchful for the destruction ofsouls and while he spread abroad his delusions it wasfolly to imagine that evidence alone was powerful enoughto counteract them what judges were the great mass ofmankind of the integrity and validity of evidence the jestof the scorner was ever at hand to turn into ridicule the mostsacred mysteries the opposers of our holy faith were intravels of st leon indefatigable in their industry and as anxious in their exertionsto deprive their fellowmen of every comfort and hopeas if infidelity which was the curse of the human specieswere the greatest blessing that could be conferred onthem the devil was a hard taskmaster and granted novacation night or day to those who enlisted themselves inthe support of his cause it might answer well enoughthe purpose of the vainglorious theorist to suppose thatman was a rational animal but they who had regardedhuman society with an observing eye knew that it wasotherwise delusion would ever be too hard for evidenceand the grossest falsehoods prove victorious over the mostsacred truths if what was illiberally and maliciously styledpersecution were not brought in aid of the cause of religionthe passions of mankind were on the side of falsehoodman unrestrained by law was a wild ferocious and mostpernicious beast and were it not for the wholesome curbof authority would speedily throw off all ties and limitationshuman and divine nothing could more clearlyprove that the heretical followers of luther and calvinwho had lately sprung up for the plague of mankindwhatever they might pretend were in reality the determinedenemies of all revelation than their continual demandthat the cause should be tried by discussion andthat every man should be defended in the exercise of hisprivate judgment they could not but know everyman not totally robbed of all power of discernment mustknow that if this demand were once granted it wouldprove a blow at the root of every sentiment of religionthe inquisition therefore was the most salutary institutionthat had ever been devised and the future welfare ofmankind wholly depended upon the maintenance of itspowers and its maxims by a moderate and judiciousexhibition of terror it superseded the necessity of innumerablepunishments the inquisition was not capriciousand uncertain in its policy it acted under the direction ofimmutable laws it held a tender but a firm rein upon theextravagances and madness of mankind nothing wasmore notorious than that a regular and systematical proceedingwas both more effectual and more generous than travels op st leonone that was fickle he defied the whole history of theworld to produce an example of so merciful a tribunalthe great end of its policy was the reclaiming of sinnersand the multiplication of penitents who after a gentleand salutary discipline were again by holy church receivedinto her bosom and even when they delivered the finallyimpenitent to the flames it was to the flames of a purifyingfire which by destroying the flesh redeemed or diminishedthe punishments of a future world he knew that an outcryhad been artfully raised against the proceedings of theholy office but it was easy to see that its enemies underthe pretence of compassion for its victims concealed aninveterate animosity against property religion and civilsociety the anabaptists had thrown off the mask anddiscovered their true designs and the rest were only moreplausible and specious in proportion as they were moretimid the present was the most important crisis thatever occurred in the history of the world there was aspirit at work that aimed at dissolving all the bonds ofcivil society and converting mankind into beasts andsavages who had not heard of the levellers millenariansand fifthmonarchymen who under the specious guise ofdisinterestedness and an universal love of mankind hadnothing in view but the most sacrilegious and unprincipleddepredations it was true that the preachers of thesedoctrines were utterly contemptible both for numbers andtalent but it would be found a shortsighted policy tooverlook these desperate assailants on account of the poornessand meanness of their qualifications for his ownpart he did not hesitate to say that human society wouldowe its preservation if it were preserved to the mercifulyet vigorous proceedings of the court of inquisition themisrepresentations that were invidiously made of the presentfirm and vigilant system of policy would be heard foraday and then universally abandoned posterity he waswell assured would do full justice to the sagacity andsoundness of the conduct of this calumniated and muchinjured institutionthe reader will forgive me if the panegyric thus elaboratelypronounced by the inquisitor who examined metravels op st leon upon the court of which he was a member had not all theweight with my mind at the moment i heard it which hewill probably ascribe to it in the calmness of the closetit is so difficult to be impartial in our own cause thecandid mind will no doubt make a large allowance for theunhappy situation in which i now stood and the bitter andgalling thoughts that preyed upon my

of theextensive power which heaven had thought fit to allowhim men of a sceptical and feeble understanding hadbeen tempted to doubt whether this was consistent withthe wisdom and goodness of god but though it was invain for us to pretend to fathom the depth of the divinemysteries there were certain reasons that were sufficientlyobvious to every ingenuous mind there were persons inall ages of the world who like the sadducees in the timeof our blessed saviour were inclined to affirm that therewas no resurrection neither angel nor spirit and godpermitted the lying wonders of infernal agents the morecompletely to confound the unbelief of his enemies hewho witnessed the wonderful operations of witchcraft orsaw the ghost of a man departed could not doubt of theinterference of invisible agents

happy if he could betheinstrument of my deliverance the language i haduttered was highly indecorous and such as seemed in itselfto call for a rigorous penance but he should not thinkhimself worthy the

wouldoften mistake their friends for their enemies i regardedthe inquisition as my enemy it was in reality my firm anddisinterested friend zealously watchful for my body mymy soul and my estate other courts had other maximsof proceeding because their motives of action were differentand it was but just that they should furnish their prisonerswith a defence against their frailty but the breast of aninquisitor was accessible to no sentiment but that of lovea burning love of god love of the church love of theprisoner who might be wrongfully accused love of thepenitent whom he reconciled to our common mother thechurch love even of the incorrigible heretic whose body heburned for the good of his soul the inquisitor did notdiscover to the prisoner the evidence adduced against him that was between god and the inquisitor's conscience butthe suppression which was thus practised rendered himdoubly scrupulous and sceptical as to the evidence he received he sifted it with a severity that the prisoner wouldin vain endeavour to imitate and the rules of evidence inthat court were so guarded punctilious and minute as torender any mistake in its proceedings altogether impossiblefor a man to be once a prisoner of the court of inquisitionby a salutary prejudice which prevailed through the catholicworld rendered him for ever infamous this was anothercause of the extreme wariness and caution with which thatcourt was accustomed to proceed they first listened tothe accuser who was obliged to give in his information onoath they then instituted a secret enquiry against they travels of st leonparty accused and till they had collected abundant groundfor their proceeding they did not venture to touch a hair ofhis head they elaborately classed all the different degreesof evidence into half proof full proof proof less than halfand proof less than full when these things were duly consideredit would appear certain that no court that had at anytimeexisted on earth had ever been so tender in its proceedingsso pure in its incitements and so every way superiorto the attacks of calumny and malice as the court ofinquisitionwith respect to myself in particular he said they hadnot apprehended me and put me upon my defence withoutpreviously assembling a large body of miscellaneous andcircumstantial evidence the evidence they had drawnfrom myself was negative only but it was strong the obscuritythat hung about my person who i was and whencei came and the obscurity that hung about my fortune agreat visible expenditure in spain or in italy and no visiblemeans these were not the signatures and tokens of innocencethey tended strongly to confirm the accusationunder which i laboured yet so tender was the inquisitionin its proceeding and so chary of its reputation that uponthese accumulated proofs and presumptions they were notprepared to pronounce against me they would hear meagain and again they would give me time to recollectmyself and for this purpose they would order for me acoarse and scanty fare and a solitary cell i might dependupon it my contumacy should be overcome the fundamentalprinciple of their proceedings was borrowed fromthat humane and compassionate maxim of the old romanlaw de vita hominis nulla cunctatio est long and ishould accordingly find them free from all precipitation andimpatience and ready to indulge me with a residence howeverlong in their prisons till my case had been sifted tothe bottomtravels of st leonchapter xxxithe indulgence thus ostentatiously proclaimed by the fatherinquisitorwas not exactly to my taste finding that allthe energy of mind i could apply to my defence was vaini determined to have recourse to a different mode of proceedingi received three admonitions as they call themthe substance of which i have already recited in the courseof the first ten days of my confinement and i then forsome time heard of the inquisitor no more i understoodthat it was frequently the practice after three admonitionsnot to bring up the prisoner for further hearingduring a whole year and it appeared sufficiently probablefrom the last words addressed to me by my judgethat this policy was intended to be employed in mycase without further delay therefore i resolved to recurto the expedient in the use of which my power wasunbounded and by a brilliant offer at once to subdue thescruples and secure the fidelity of the person or personsupon whom my safe custody might be found to dependall that was necessary was to convince the party to whomi should propose the assisting me of the reality of mypowers and then to put carte blanche into his hands orrather to ascertain at once the extent of his hopes and demandsand by a spirited and peremptory conduct to yieldthem all in the period which immediately previous tomy present imprisonment i had devoted to the meditationof my future plans and the review of my past i had severelyaccused myself of half measures and had determined toabjure all hesitation and irresoluteness for the time to comeit is not indeed to be wondered at that possessing a powerso utterly remote from common ideas and conceptions andwhich speaking from experience i do not hesitate to affirmno mere effort of imagination is adequate to represent ishould have acted below the prerogatives and demands ofmy situation this mistake i would make no more iwould overwhelm opposition by the splendour of my proceedingsand confound scruples by the dignity and princelyy travels of st leonmagnificence of my appearance unshackled as i was withconnections and risking no one's happiness but my own iproposed to compel the human species to view me from anawful distance and to oblige every one that approached meto feel his inferiority it would be to the last degree disgracefuland contemptible in me being raised so far abovemy peers in my privileges if i were to fall below the ordinarystandard of a gallant man in the decision and firmnessof my system of conduct decision and firmness were theprinciples to be exercised by me now dignity and magnificencemust await their turn hereafterit was not long before i embraced an opportunity ofspeaking to the man who waited on me with my dailyallotment of provisions and i designed as shortly as possibleto proceed to that species of argument in which iprincipally confided to engage him in my cause but hedid not suffer me to utter a sentence before with a veryexpressive gesture he interrupted me i had remarkedalready the silence which seemed for ever to pervade thisdismal abode but i had not ascribed importance enough tothis circumstance to suppose that it could materially interferewith the project i had formed i now perceived thecountenance of my attendant to be overspread with terrorand alarm he put his hand upon my mouth and by hisattitude seemed earnestly to insist upon my conforming tothe rules of the prison i was not however to be thusdiverted from my purpose i seized his hands and beganagain to pursue the discourse i had meditated this proceedingon my part induced him to break the silence hehad hitherto preserved he told me that if i did not instantlyset him at liberty he would alarm the prison iloosed his hands i then by every gesture i could deviseendeavoured to prevail on him to approach me to suffer meto confer with him in the lowest whisper and assuredhim that he should have no reason to repent his compliancei might as well have addressed myself to the walls thatinclosed me he would not stay an instant he wouldyield in nothing he burst from me abruptly and closingthe door of my cell left me in solitude and darknesstravels of st leon in the evening of the day of this attempt the keeper ofthe prison entered my apartment when he appeared ibegan to flatter myself that in this man i should find abetter subject for my purpose than in the poor turnkey whohad given me so unfavourable a prognostic of my successi lost no time in saying to him that i had something importantto communicate but he peremptorily commandedme to be silent and listen to what he was about to say tomehe told me that i had already been complainedagainst for speech and i was now repeating my offencehe advised me to ponder well the consequences of what iwas doing the orders of the inquisition were rigorousand inflexible the cells were not so substantially separatedbut that a voice might be heard from one to the otheryet it had happened more than once that a husband andwife a father and child had for years been lodged next toeach other without the smallest suspicion on either part ofthe proximity of their situation he was astonished at thepertinacity of my behaviour there was no government onthe face of the earth he would venture to say that had subjectsmore obedient more dutiful and exemplary than theholy inquisition not a murmur was ever heard not adiscontent ever expressed all was humbleness thankfulnessand gratitude he recommended to me to conformmyself to my situation and let him hear no further complaintsof me he had no sooner finished his haranguethan he left me as abruptly as his servant had done it isnot possible to impart any adequate image of the inflexibilityof his features or the stern composure of his demeanouri now saw my situation in a different point of viewbribery was of no use where all intercourse was deniedgreat god into what position was i got in the midstof a great and populous city at this time perhaps the metropolisof the world i heard occasionally from beyond thelimits of my prison the hum of busy throngs or the shoutsof a tumultuous populace yet i was

expression of a meaning nor hismouth opened for the utterance of a sound from the firsti had been struck with the extreme and deathlike silencethat characterised the place of my confinement but mymind was occupied with other thoughts and i had notadverted to the cause of the phenomenon i had then feltlittle inclination to the converse of a jailor my natural dispositionwas somewhat singular for a frenchman and inclinedto taciturnity i had resolved to make a fair andample trial of the power of a just defence where my innocencewas so complete and i was entirely disengagedfrom those unfavourable appearances which had constitutedmy misfortune at constance and i even rejoiced that asilence which i regarded as casual and individual deliveredme from all fear of impertinence in my attendant withhow different a temper do we contemplate an incidentwhich we persuade ourselves continues to operate onlybecause we want inclination to remove it and an incidentwhich is violently imposed and to which with the utmostexertion of our strength we cannot succeed to impart theslightest shock the external object is the same its picturein the intellectual sensorium how unlike what a profoundand inconceivable refinement in the art of tyranny is thissilence the jailor might well tell me that beneath hisroofs there was neither complaint nor murmur that thevery soul of its inhabitants was subdued and that theysuffered the most unheard of oppressions without astonishmentor indignation this is the peculiar prerogative ofdespotism it produces many symptoms of the same generalappearance as those which are derived from liberty andjustice there are no remonstrances there is no impatienceor violence there is a calm a fatal and accursedtranquillity that pervades the whole the spectator entersand for a time misinterprets every object he sees he perceiveshuman bodies standing or moving around him andit is with the utmost surprise if he has leisure and opportunityto observe a little further that he finds at last thetravels of st leon things he sees to be the mere shades of men cold inertglaring bodies which the heavenborn soul has long sincedeserted wonderful i hesitate not to affirm is the genuineand direct power of such a situation as that in whichi was now placed upon the human imagination whatwas it then to me to whom speech was not merely one ofthose things misnamed indulgences misnamed luxuriesupon which the desirableness and the health of human existencedepend but who had looked to it as the only andthe assured means of my rescue from this scene of horrors i intreat the reader to pardon me when i confess that theoperation of the discovery i made was so overwhelmingand apparently desperate that it was some weeks i mightsay months before my mind recovered its wonted bias andactivityit was towards the close of the period i have namedthat a new incident concurring with that familiarity whichserves in some measure to disarm every mischief of itssting restored and reawakened my mind i had vegetatednow for some time if the metaphor can with propriety beapplied to existence in a noxious and imprisoned air bywhich all vegetation would have been undermined andwhich the vital principle in man is scarcely competent tosurmount and in all this period had encountered nothingfrom without nor received any intimation that could in theslightest degree interrupt the progressive destruction andwaste of the soul one day at the customary hour of mybeing attended by my warder i was surprised to see himbring with him a visiter to my cell the unknown was aman with grey hairs and a silver beard though once tallhe now stooped considerably and supported himself with astaff his dress was simple and neat and his whole appearanceprepossessing a sweet serenity was diffused over hiscountenance yet there were occasionally a fire and a contemplativegrasp of thought expressed in his eyes whichsufficiently proved to me that his serenity was not the resultof vacancy all this i discerned by the faint and uncertainlight of a small lamp which the warder had brought withhim and placed upon my table the introduction wasperformed in silence and the warder left us alone they travels of st leonunknown beckoned me to be seated for the first emotionof surprise at the entrance of a stranger had caused me tostart on my feet and opening a folding stool he had receivedfrom my attendant he placed himself beside mehe then addressed me in a low voice and told me thatthe humanity of the fathers of the inquisition had givenhim permission to visit me and that if i would be soobliging in conformity to the regulations of the prison asto lower my voice to the standard of his we were at libertyto confer together he hoped the conference would be somerelief to my solitude if not lead to my complete liberationhe then unfolded to me his story he told me that helike myself had been committed to the prisons of the inquisitionupon an accusation of sorcery having advancedthus far he stopped he talked miscellaneously and digressivelyof wizards and their familiars of possessions and demonsof charms spells talismans and incantations even ofthe elixir vita and the philosopher's stone sometimes inthe progress of this discourse i could perceive him observingme with the utmost narrowness as if he would dive intomy soul and again particularly when he caught a glanceof suspicion in my eye with infinite address changing hisattitude and tone and assuming a surprising air of ingenuousnessand gaiety in a word he was a consummateactor it was evident whether his designs were hostile orfriendly that his purpose was to make himself master ofmy secret i asked him whether the accusation of sorcerywhich had been preferred against him were well foundedor a calumny he evaded that question and was onlyinfluenced by it to talk more copiously and fluently on othertopics with the apparent design of making me forget theenquiry i had made he avoided anticipation lest he shouldmiscalculate and take wrong ground in my affair andthough superficially he seemed communicative i found thathe scarcely told me respecting himself any one thing definiteand clear he celebrated the clemency of the fathers of theinquisition he said they seemed to regard themselves asthe adoptive parents of those they held in their custodyand were anxious solely for the restoration of souls intheir exterior they were austere and had unfortunately contravelsof st leon traced a forbidding manner but he had soon found upona closer inspection of their character that the only way todeal successfully with them was to repose in them a perfectconfidence this panegyric was not resorted to till he hadexhausted the various topics by which he had hoped himselfto extort my secret from me i asked him whetherthe effect of his reposing confidence had been an abjurationof sorcery and reconciliation to the church but this questionexperienced the fate of every other that i addressed tohim he only told me generally that he had every reasonto be satisfied with and to speak well of the treatment hehad experienced in the house of the inquisition he possessedor rather as i believed affected a character ofthoughtless garrulity and loquacity well adapted to coverthe strange deviations and abrupt transitions that markedhis discourse it was certainly singularly contrasted withthat close and penetrating air which from time to time iremarked in himthe reader may deem it surprising and unaccountable but certain it is i took uncommon delight in this man'scompany i pressed him earnestly to repeat his visits andwould scarcely suffer him to depart till he had promisedto come to me again the next day or the day after yet ilooked on him as my mortal enemy and had no doubt thathe was one of the infamous wretches employed by thepolicy of the inquisition and well known beneath thosehated roofs by the appellation of moscas various reasonsmay be assigned for my conduct in this particular let itfirst be remembered that i was alone and for months hadnot heard the sound of my own voice no incident markedmy days j no object arrested my attention a dull heavypestilential souldepressing monotony formed the historyof my life if in this situation i had been visited by amouse or a rat i should indefatigably have sought to getwithin reach of it i should have put it to my bosom and havefelt with exultation the beat of an animal pulse the warmthof animal life pressing responsively on my heart withwhat eager appetite i should have mixed in scenes of calamityand cruelty intolerable to any other eye glad formyself that even upon such terms i could escape the froststravels op st leonbound winter of the soul how i should have rejoicedlike king richard of england to see four grim and deathdealingassassins enter my cell like him to struggle andwrestle and contend with my murderers though as in hiscase wounds and a fatal end should be the result thusfeeling then it is little wonderful that i should have hailedwith pleasure the visit of the muscabut this was not all while i conferred with or ratherlistened to my visiter that pride and self complacencywhich i suspect to be the main or at least the indispensableingredient of all our pleasures revived in my heart i believedthat he was set upon me by these insatiable bloodsuckersof the inquisition that he might ensnare me withhis questions and treacherously inveigle me to the faggotand the stake i felt a last lambent intimation of pridewithin me when my heart whispered me this man shallnot attain his ends i secretly defied his arts and amusedmyself with baffling his most cunning devices i had nowsome one with whom to measure myself the comparisoni own for a descendant of the counts of st leon was ahumble one but it is not permitted a prisoner in the jailsof the inquisition to be fastidious in his pleasures thisman i played with at my ease and laughed at his stratagemsi therefore felt that i was his superior and whichwas a sensation i had not lately been accustomed to that iwas somebody these feelings recommended to me hisvisitsbut what was much more material i looked furtherand proposed an ultimate end to this occurrence let itbe recollected what was my unhappiness when i foundmyself if i may be allowed the expression suddenly deprivedof speech and then it will easily be understood howsincerely i rejoiced to have this faculty restored to mespeech as i have already said i had regarded as the onlyand assured means of my deliverance from this scene ofhorrors i therefore doubted not that from this miserabletool of my oppressors i would obtain my enlargement istood firmly on my guard i permitted him to run outthe whole length of his own project without interruptionby this delay i should better understand his character andtravels op st leon finally seize it with a more decisive grasp thus purposingi allowed three or four visits to pass before i opened to themusca my own proposal i designed unexpectedly to turnthe tables upon him to surprise and finish with him atonce i knew not that all this precaution was necessarybut i played for too deep a stake not to be anxious to omitnothing which hereafter in retrospect i might reproachmyself that i had omittedthe time was at length come at which i judged it convenientto execute what i had planned in my mind ibegan with an attempt to mortify and humble my guest inhis own eyes that he might lose the pride to make thesmallest resistance to my proposal do you think my good sir cried i that i have notperfectly understood

the trial i had madebut i added a new chapter to my knowledge of humannature i found that to be a knave it was not necessaryto be an infidel i corrected the too hasty conclusion whichi had adopted with the rest of my contemporaries that hewhose conduct was infamous must inevitably be destituteof religious impressions and belief and i became satisfiedthat a man while he practised every vice that can disgracehuman nature might imagine he was doing god serviceenough of the interior of the prison of the inquisitioni remained a tenant of this wretched mansion twelve yearsthough the wretch who had been placed upon me as a spywas from my proposal to him satisfied of my guilt hissuperiors were not so they found nothing in what hereported definitive as to the nature of my unlawful practicesand they could extort from me no further confessionthey therefore adhered to their favourite maxim to avoidthe precipitate mistakes of other tribunals and to allowtheir prisoner ful time to develop his guilt or as they pretendedto establish his innocence perhaps too the temperof the prince who now filled the spanish throne contributedto my safety they could not content themselveswith a less punishment for so obstinate and incorrigible aheretic than that of the flames but during the reign ofthe emperor charles this species of punishment for heresywas rarely inflicted and only one or two

monarchy about the close of the year buthis affairs in england and the netherlands long withheldhim from visiting his beloved country and he did not reachits shores after a seven years absence till the twentyninthof august it may be thought that a public eventof this sort could be little interesting to me a forgottenprisoner immured in the dungeons of the inquisitionthe fact was otherwise the king was desirous of distinguishinghis arrival on his native soil by some splendidexhibition or memorable event that should at once expresshis piety to god and conduce to the felicity of his people and he could think of nothing that so signally unitedthese characters as an auto de fe the lutheran heresywhich in the course of forty years had spread its poison sowidely in the different countries of europe had not failedto scatter a few of its noxious seeds even in this thepurest and most catholic of all its divisions but philiphad early proclaimed his hostility against this innovation and prostrating himself before the image of his saviourhad earnestly besought the divine majesty that he mightnever suffer himself to be or to be called the lord of thosein any corner of the globe who should deny him thelord previously to his arrival in spain directions hadbeen given and arrangements made respecting the piousand solemn exhibition he demanded formerly those whoby the fathers of the inquisition had been delivered over tothe secular arm had been executed in the different placeswhere their crimes had been committed or their trials beenheld but now it was proposed that all those throughoutthe kingdom who were found properly qualified to satisfyby their deaths the sublime taste of the royal saint shouldbe divided into two troops and sent the one to sevillelong the capital of an illustrious monarchy and the otherto valladolid which had the honour to be the birthplaceof the present sovereign the troop destined to feed thetravels of st leon flames at seville was composed of fifty persons many ofthem distinguished for their rank their talents or theirvirtues the troop to he escorted to valladolid of whichi was a member amounted only to thirty but to compensatethis deficiency philip himself had signified his graciousintention to be present together with the heir apparent andhis whole court at that exhibition the spanish nationrejoicing in the approach of a

different naturevalladolid is distant from the metropolis eightyfourmiles we had already been some weeks prepared for thisjourney and piously directed to hold ourselves in readinessto take our part in the solemn national sacrifice wewaited however to receive a previous notice of the day onwhich the monarch would enter the place of his birthsince so great was his royal zeal for the cause of religionand civil society that he would not consent to be absentfrom any part of the spectacle and accordingly it was notallowed us to enter the scene of our final destination tillthe king of spain and the indies should be already on thespot and prepared to receive us the auto da fe performedat seville had the precedence of ours it took placeon the twentyfourth of september and we were indulgedwith an accurate account of it and were present at a publicreading of the record of the act in the chapel of our prisonpreviously to our removal from the metropolisi will not enter into a minute detail of the scene of thisreading though the recollection will never be effaced frommy memory of the persons present who were destined tosuffer capital punishment eight were women four ofthem were taken from a single family being a grandmothera mother and two daughters of the noble house of alcalathey had all been beautiful of person and of a gracefulfigure the youngest of the daughters was in the nineteenthtravels of st leonyear of her age their crime together with that of themajority of their fellowsufferers was obstinate and impenitentlutheranism the seats of the women were separatedfrom the rest and fronted with a close lattice themen were twentytwo in number and their appearance wastruly impressive their persons were neglected and theirfigures emaciated j their eyes were sunk and ghastly andtheir complexions of a sallow and deathlike white mostof them were crippled by their long confinement and theseverities they had endured and were supported to theirseats upon an elevated scaffolding with benches raised oneabove another by two apparatus one on each side of thecondemned heretic god of mercy and benevolence is itpossible that this scene should be regarded as thy triumphand the execution destined to follow as a sacrifice acceptablein thy sight if these papers of mine are ever producedto light may it not happen that they shall first beread by a distant posterity who will refuse to believe thattheir fathers were ever mad enough to subject each other toso horrible a treatment merely because they were unableto adopt each other's opinions oh no human

that the philanthropyand purity of heart in which it is maintained onlyrender its defenders the more worthy to be extirpatedwhat were the ideas and reflections of my fellows seatedon the benches above below and on either side of me iam unable to affirm my own could not fail to be pungentand distressing i understood continually more and moreof the mysterious and unuttered history of the strangerwho died in the summerhouse of the lake of constance travels of st leon i found that i was only acting over again what he hadexperienced before me his legacies had served to involveme in the bitterest and most unheard of miseries but werewholly destitute of ability to rescue from the evils themselvescreated unbounded wealth i found to have nopower to bribe the dastard slaves of religious bigotry andthe elixir of immortality though it could cure disease andput to flight the approaches of age was impotent to repelthe fervour of devouring flames i might have been happyi was happy when the stranger found me i mighthave lived to a virtuous and venerable old age and havedied in the arms of my posterity the stranger had givenme wealth and i was now poorer than the peasant whowanders amidst polar snows the stranger had given meimmortality and in a few days i was to expire in excruciatingtortures lie found me tranquil contented in themidst of simple yet inestimable pleasures he breathed intome the restless sentiment of ambition and it was that sentimentwhich at length had placed me on high in the chapelof the prison of the catholic inquisitionour progress to valladolid was slow and solemn andoccupied a space of no less than four days on the eveningof the fourth day we approached that city the kingand his court came out to meet us he saluted the inquisitorgeneral with all the demonstrations of the deepestsubmission and humility and then having yielded himthe place of honour turned round his horse and accompaniedus to valladolid the cavalcade that attended theking broke into two files and received us in the midst ofthem the whole city seemed to empty itself on this memorableoccasion and the multitudes that crowded alongthe road and were scattered in the neighbouring fieldswere innumerable the day was now closed and the processionwent forward amidst the light of a thousand torcheswe the condemned of the inquisition had been conductedfrom the metropolis upon tumbrils but as we arrived atthe gates of valladolid we were commanded for the greaterhumiliation to alight and proceed on foot to the place ofour confinement as many as could not walk without assistancebeing supported by the attendants we werez travels of st leonneither chained nor bound the practice of the inquisitionbeing to deliver the condemned upon such occasions intothe hands of two sureties each who placed their charge inthe middle between them and men of the most respectablecharacters were accustomed from religious motives to suefor this melancholy officedejected and despairing i entered the streets of the cityno object present to the eyes of my mind but that of myapproaching execution the crowd was vast the confusioninexpressible as we passed by the end of a narrowlane the horse of one of the guards who rode exactly in aline with me plunged and reared in a violent manner andat length threw his rider upon the pavement others ofthe horseguards attempted to catch the bridle of the enragedanimal they rushed against each other severalof the crowd were thrown down and trampled under thehorses feet the shrieks of these and the loud cries andexclamations of the bystanders mingled in confused anddiscordant chorus no sound no object could be distinguishedfrom the excess of the tumult a sudden thoughtdarted into my mind where all an instant before had beenrelaxation and despair two or three of the horses pushedffward in a particular direction a moment after theyresiled with equal violence and left a wide but transitorygap my project was no sooner conceived than executedweak as i had just now felt myself a supernatural tide ofstrength seemed to come over me i sprung away with allimaginable impetuosity and rushed down the lane i havejust mentioned every one amidst the confusion was attentiveto his personal safety and several minutes elapsedbefore i was missedchapter xxxiiiin the lane every thing was silent and the darkness wasextreme man woman and child were gone out to viewthe procession for some time i could scarcely distinguisha single object the doors and windows were all closed inow chanced to come to an open door within i saw notravels of st leon one but an old man who was busy over some metallic workat a chafingdish of fire i had no room for choice iexpected every moment to hear the myrmidons of the inquisitionat my heels i rushed in i impetuously closedthe door and bolted it j i then seized the old man by thecollar of his shirt with a determined grasp and swore vehementlythat i would annihilate him that instant if hedid not consent to afford me assistance though for sometimei had perhaps been feebler than he the terror thatnow drove me on rendered me comparatively a giant heintreated me to permit him to breathe and promised to dowhatever i should desire i looked round the apartmentand saw a rapier hanging against the wall of which i instantlyproceeded to make myself master while i wasdoing this my involuntary host who was extremely terrifiedat my procedure nimbly attempted to slip by me andrush into the street with difficulty i caught hold of hisarm and pulling him back put the point of my rapier tohis breast solemnly assuring him that no consideration onearth should save him from my fury if he attempted toescape a second time he immediately dropped on hisknees and with the most piteous accents intreated me tospare his life i told him that i was no robber that idnot intend him the slightest harm and that if he wouldimplicitly yield to my direction he might assure himselfhe never should have reason to repent his compliance bythis declaration the terrors of the old man were somewhatappeased i took the opportunity of this calm to go to thestreet door which i instantly locked and put the key inmy bosomnothing but the most fortunate concurrence of circumstancescould have thus forwarded my escape the rearingof the horse of the lifeguardsman was purely accidentalthe concourse and press of the crowd from all sides couldalone have rendered this circumstance of any magnitudethe gap which was made by the pushing forwards and resilingof the horses continued barely long enough for me tospring through and closed again in an instant it is astonishingthat the thought of escape should have thus suddenlydarted into my mind which but a moment beforez travels of st leonwas in a state of dejection equally incompatible with activityand with hope that in the lane down which i rushedi should have met no human creature and that the firstopen door i saw should lead to the residence of a decrepidold man who appeared to be its single inhabitant wereoccurrences equally extraordinary yet seem to have beenboth indispensable to my safety one point more concurredwith this fortunate train and assisted to still thepalpitations of my beating heart i perceived by certainindications in the countenance of my host that he was byparentage a jew i presently concluded that he was whatin spain they denominate a new christian for that otherwisehe would not have been allowed to reside at large in aspanish city but upon that supposition i did not believethat christianity was very deeply mingled up in him withthe vital principle the converts of the inquisition are notconspicuous for their sincerity now then for the firsttime i thought in the course of twelve years had opportunityto communicate with a man whose soul was notenslaved to the bloodthirsty superstition of this devotedcountry all i had seen during the period of my confinementwere hyenas tigers and crocodiles they were not meni had no sooner soothed my host into a temper to listento my story than i told him with all imaginable franknesswhence i came and to what i had been destined themention of sorcery however and preternatural practices isuppressed for i suspected that persons of all religionsentertained an equal horror against these i suffered himto imagine that the allegation against me had been the crimeof heresy all sects of the christian superstition might be supposedequally obnoxious or acceptable to a jew i emphaticallyappealed to the persecutions which had been so longdirected against the religion of his ancestors and observedhow disgraceful it would be in him to assist the operationof a principle the effects of which his fathers had so deeplydeplored and so perfectly abhorred i assured him that iwould bring him into no danger and that all i asked wasthe protection of a few hours i would leave him in thecourse of the following day and he should hear of me nomore i reminded him that the danger he had to fearwas in betraying not in protecting me the inquisitiontravels of st leox looked upon every new christian with an eye of the severestjealousy and the mere fact if known that i had takenrefuge in his house would infallibly subject him to thepurgation of a temporary imprisonment in their dungeonsit would be in vain for him to affirm that he had no choicein what had occurred he was without a witness to confirmhis relation and the assertions of a man born of jewishparents never obtained credit in the court of the inquisitioni added with solemn asseverations that the moment i setfoot beyond the territory of spain i would remit to himthe sum of six hundred pistoles as an acknowledgment forhis kindnessduring the whole of my discourse i watched his countenancewith the utmost minuteness it gradually relaxedfrom the terror which had at first appeared in it to expressionsof compassion and complacence i saw nothingthat ought to alarm me when it was his turn to speakhe earnestly assured me that he took a warm interest inmy story and would cheerfully perform every thing i requiredhe was happy that my favourable stars had ledme to his habitation and would rejoice to the latest hourof his existence if they rendered him instrumental in preservingthe life of a human being from so deplorable acatastrophe while i talked to him i easily perceived thatthe arguments i used which produced the most sensibleeffect upon his features were those of the dangers arisingto him from betraying me and the reward of six hundredpistoles which i promised him in the event of my successhis motives however were blended together in his mind andhe had no sooner formed a determination grounded perhapsupon the meanest considerations than he became eloquentin a panegyric of his own benevolence by which he wasnot i believe more anxious to impose upon me than toput the change upon himself i considered all that he saidhis gestures and the very tones of his voice with eageranxiety the terror of the inquisition penetrated to themarrow in my bones and the fate awarded against me bythat court became inexpressibly more horrible to my thoughtsnow that i saw the probability of escaping it every thingthat i observed in the jew was apparently fair plausiblez hi travels of st leonand encouraging but nothing had power to quell the agitationsof my apprehensive soulwe were still engaged in discussing the topics havementioned when i was suddenly alarmed by the noise ofsome one stirring in the inner apartment i had lookedinto this room and had perceived nothing but the bed uponwhich the old man nightly reposed himself i sprung uphowever at the sound and perceiving that the door had abolt on the outside i eagerly fastened it i then turnedto mordecai such previously to his conversion had beenthe name of my host wretch said i did not youassure me that there was no one but yourself in the house tf oh cried mordecai it is my child it is my child she went into the inner apartment and has fallen asleep onthe bed beware i answered die slightest falsehoodmore shall instantly be expiated in your blood tf icall abraham to witness rejoined the once more terrifiedjew it is my child only my child tell mecried i with severity of accent how old is this child only five years said mordecai my dear leah diedwhen her babe was no more than a year old and thoughwe had several children this single one has survived herspeak to your child let me hear her voice he spoketo her and she answered father want to come outi was satisfied it was the voice of a little girl turned tothe jew take care said i how you deceive menow is there no other person in that room he imprecateda curse on himself if there were i opened thedoor with caution and the little girl came forward assoon as i saw her i seized her with a rapid motion andretired hack to a chair man said i you have trifledwith me too rashly you have not considered what amescaped from and what i have to fear from this momentthis child shall be the pledge of my safety i will not partwith her an instant as long as i remain in your house andwith this rapier in my hand i will pierce her to the heartthe moment i am led to imagine that i am no longer insafety the jew trembled at my resolution the emotionsof a father worked in his features and glistened in his eyeat least let me kiss her said he be it so retravels of st leon plied i one embrace and then till the dawn of thecoming day she remains with me i released my hold the child rushed to her father and he caught her in hisarms my dear leah cried mordecai now a saintedspirit in the bosom of our father abraham i call god towitness between us that if all my caution and vigilancecan prevent it not a hair of this child shall be injured stranger you little know by how strong a motive you havenow engaged me to your cause we poor jews huntedon the face of the earth the abhorrence and execration ofmankind have nothing but family affections to support usunder our multiplied disgraces and family affections areentwined with our existence the fondest and bestlovedpart of ourselves the god of abraham bless you mychild now sir speak what is it you require of me i told the jew that i must have a suit of clothes conformableto the appearance of a spanish cavalier and certainmedical ingredients that i named to him together withhis chafingdish of coals to prepare them and that donei would then impose on him no further trouble havingreceived his instructions he immediately set out to procurewhat i demanded he took with him the key of thehouse and as soon as he was gone i retired with thechild into the inner apartment and fastened the door atfirst i applied myself to tranquillise the child who hadbeen somewhat alarmed at what she had heard and seen this was no very difficult task she presently left me toamuse herself with some playthings that lay scattered in acorner of the apartment my heart was now comparativelyat ease i saw the powerful hold i had on the fidelity ofthe jew and firmly persuaded myself that i had no treacheryto fear on his part thus circumstanced the exertionand activity with which i had lately been imbued leftme and i insensibly sunk into a sort of slumberthe night was now far advanced and i was still reclinedinsensible upon mordecai's bed when suddenly a jargon ofvarious sounds seemed from all sides to assail me mymind was confused i heard something but seemed whollyunconscious what i was and where i wanted to escapefrom the disturbance but it continued and even increasedtravels of st leonat length i was forced to command my attention and thefirst thing i perceived was a beating at the door of thechamber the little girl was come to the bedside and endeavouringto shake me sir sir she cried in an eageraccent my father wants to come in and i cannot slip thebolt of the door by slow degrees i began to comprehendmy situation and to recollect what had happened immediatelybefore i felt greatly alarmed i feared by the disturbancethat mordecai had not returned alone i essayedto speak my organs refused their office i endeavouredto move my limbs felt palsied and absolutely lifeless iexperienced a sinking and sickness of heart that seemed tobe the immediate precursor of death by listening occasionallyto the discourse which the father and the daughterbegan to hold with each other i became satisfied that mordecaiwas without a companion i endeavoured to makethe little girl understand that i was incapable of rising fromthe bed and having at length succeeded she communicatedthe information to her father with considerabletrouble he loosened the door at its hinges and entered theroom i found myself in the extremest degree feeble andlanguid the jew however assiduously administered to meof cordials he had in his possession and by degrees i feltmyself considerably restorednow for the first time i was at leisure to attend to thestate of my strength and my health my confinement in theinquisition and the treatment i had experienced hadbefore rendered me feeble and almost helpless but theseappeared to be circumstances scarcely worthy of attentionin the situation in which i was then placed the impulsei felt in the midst of the confusion in the grand street ofvalladolid produced in me an energy and power of exertionwhich nothing but the actual experience of the fact couldhave persuaded me was possible this energy once begunappeared to have the faculty of prolonging itself and i didnot relapse into imbecility till the occasion seemed to beexhausted which called for my exertion i examined myselfby a mirror with which mordecai furnished me ifound my hair as white as snow and my face ploughed witha thousand furrows was now fiftyfour an age whichtravels of st leon with moderate exercise and a vigorous constitution oftenappears like the prime of human existence but whoeverhad looked upon me in my present condition would nothave hesitated to affirm that i had reached the eightiethyear of my age i examined with dispassionate remark thestate of my intellect i was persuaded that it had subsidedinto childishness my mind had been as much cribbed andimmured as my body i was the mere shadow of a manof no more power and worth than that which a magic lanternproduces upon a wall these are thy works superstition this the genuine and proper operation of what iscalled christianity let the reader judge of what i hadpassed through and known within those cursed walls by theeffects i have already refused i continue to refuse to tellwhat i suffered and how those effects were producedenough of compassion enough of complaint i will confinemyself as far as i am able to simple historybeing recovered as far as the cordials and attention ofmordecai were capable of recovering me i desired for theremainder of the night to be alone except that i was stillresolved to retain the little jewess as the pledge of mysafety i was greatly obliged to my host for the punctualityhe had already displayed he had found considerable difficultyin procuring the articles of which i stood in needowing partly to the lateness of the hour and partly to thepresence of the king and the general hurry and confusionwhich had been produced by the solemn entry of the inquisitionhis efforts too to recover me from the languor andlethargy into which i had sunk had a character of generosity and perhaps i ought now to have trusted him withouta hostage but my heart was too earnestly bent uponaccomplishing its present object to afford harbour to thepunctilios of delicacy the same earnestness caused me toinsist upon mordecai's repairing the injury which thehinges of the door had sustained and i was careful tosatisfy myself that every thing was restored to a state ofperfect securityi was now once again alone the little girl who hadbeen unusually disturbed and roused at an unseasonablehour sunk into a profound sleep i heard the noise which travels of st leonmordecai made in undressing himself and composing hislimbs upon a mattrass which he had dragged for the presentoccasion into the front room and spread before thehearth i soon found by the hardness of his breathing thathe also was asleep i unfolded the papers he had broughtme they consisted of various medical ingredients i haddirected him to procure there were also two or three vialscontaining syrups and essences i had near me a pair ofscales with which to weigh my ingredients a vessel ofwater the chafingdish of my host in which the fire wasnearly extinguished and a small taper with some charcoalto delight the fire in case of necessity while i was occupiedin surveying these articles and arranging my materialsa sort of torpor came suddenly over me so as to allow menotime for resistance i sunk upon the bed i remainedthus for about half an hour seemingly without the power ofcollecting my thoughts at length i started felt alarmedand applied my utmost force of mind to rouse my exertionswhile i drove or attempted to drive my animal spiritsfrom limb to limb and from part to part as if to enquireinto the general condition of my frame i became convincedthat i was dying let not the reader be surprised at this twelve years imprisonment in a narrow and unwholesomecell may well account for so sudden a catastrophe strangeand paradoxical as it may seem i believe it will be found inthe experiment that the calm and security which succeed togreat internal injuries are more dangerous than the pangsand hardships that went before i was now thoroughlyalarmed i applied myself with all vigilance and expeditionto the compounding my materials the fire was goneout the taper was glimmering in the socket to swallowthe julep when i had prepared it seemed to be the lasteffort of which my organs and muscles were capable itwas the elixir of immortality exactly made up according tothe prescription of the strangerwhether from the potency of the medicine or theeffect of imagination i felt revived the moment i hadswallowed it i placed myself deliberately in mordecai'sbed and drew over me the bedclothes i fellasleep almost instantly i believe my first sleep wastravels of st leon perfectly sound and insensible but in no long time i wasvisited with the pleasantness dreams imaginable nothingwas distinct nothing was attended with the consciousnessof my former identity but every thing was gay cheerfulinvigorating and delicious i wandered amidst verdantlawns and flowerenamelled gardens i was saluted withthe singing of a thousand birds and the murmuring of athousand fountains kids fawns and lambs frisked andgamboled before me at a distance through an openingin the trees i discerned nymphs and their swains dancinga variety of antic measures i advanced towards them they approached towards me fifes oboes recorders andinstruments of a hundred names commenced a cheerfuland melodious concert myself and the dancers now weremet they placed me in the midst of them they began achoral song the motion of their limbs conformed to theirnumbers i was the theme of the general chaunt theyascribed to me the beauty of apollo the strength ofhercules the invention of mercury and the youth ofbacchusmy sleep was not long in a few hours i awakenedwith difficulty i recognised the objects about me andrecollected where i had been it seemed to me that myheart had never beat so vigorously nor my spirits flowedso gay i was all elasticity and life i could scarcely holdmyself quiet i felt impelled to bound and leap like a kidupon the mountains i perceived that my little jewesswas still asleep she had been unusually fatigued the nightbefore i know not whether mordecai's hour of risingwere come if it were he was careful not to disturbhis guest i put on the garments he had prepared i gazed upon the mirror he had left in my apartmenti can recollect no sensation in the course of my life sounexpected and surprising as what i felt at that momentthe evening before i had seen my hair white andmy face ploughed with furrows i looked fourscore whati beheld now was totally different yet altogether familiar it was myself myself as i had appeared on the day of mymarriage with marguerite de damville the eyes themouth the hair the complexion every circumstance pointby point the same i leaped a gulf of thirtytwo years i travels of st leonwaked from a dream troublesome and distressful beyondall description but it vanished like the shades of nightupon the burst of a glorious morning in july and left notatrace behind i knew not how to take away my eyesffdm the mirror before mei soon began to consider that if it were astonishing tomethat through all the regions of my countenance icould discover no trace of what i had been the night beforeit would be still more astonishing to my host this sortof sensation i had not the smallest ambition to produce oneof the advantages of the metamorphosis i had sustainedconsisted in its tendency in the eyes of alt that saw me tocut off every species of connection between my present andmy former self it fortunately happened that the room inwhich i slept being constructed upon the model of manyothers in spain had a stair at the further end with a trapdoorin the ceiling for the purpose of enabling the inhabitantto ascend on the roof in the cool of the day theroofs were flat and so constructed that there was little difficultyin passing along them from house to house from oneend of the street to the other i availed myself of theopportunity and took leave of the residence of my kindhost in a way perfectly unceremonious determined howeverspeedily to transmit to him the reward i had promised itmay easily be believed that mordecai was not less rejoicedat the absence of a guest whom the vigilance of the inquisitionrendered an uncommonly dangerous one than i wasto quit his habitation i closed the trap after me andclambered from roof to roof to a considerable distance atlength i encountered the occasion of an open window andfortunately descended unseen by any human being intothe street having with difficulty succeeded on this occasionof public solemnity in engaging an apartment in oneof the hotels of valladolid i sent into it as soon as i wasable a chest containing every necessary of apparel andparticularly a suit of clothes i then changed my dressand threw the clothes which mordecai had provided intothe chest i had purchased as long as they continuedsafely locked up and the key in my possession no facultypossessed by any human creature could detect my identityand expose me afresh to my former jailors the onlytravels of st leon peril under which i had before laboured was from mordecaiwho if he had seen me in the garments he had procuredmight have recognised them and though a perilfrom this source came barely within the limits of possibilityit was easily avoided and i therefore chose to avoid iti passed the whole of this day in a species of enjoymentwhich as it has no parallel in the ordinary transactions ofmankind so are there no terms in the received languages ofthe world that are adequate to the description of it it hasoften been a subject of melancholy and complaint amongmortals that while the whole vegetable system contains init a principle of perpetual renewal man alone the ornamentand lord of the universe man knows no return toyouth when the sun

todayi was a citizen of the world capable of all its delightstomorrow i was destined to have been dragged to thestake with ignominy and to suffer intolerable anguish amidstthe shouts and huzzahs of an unfeeling populace tomorrowi was at liberty to employ as i pleased to choose the theatreupon which it should be spent and the gratifications thatshould be crowded into it what was most material mymind was grown young with my body weary of eternalstruggle i had lately resigned the contest and sunk underthe illfortune that relentlessly pursued me now i feltwithin me a superfluity of vigour i panted for somethingto contend with and something to conquer my senses unfoldedthemselves to all the curiosity of remark my thoughtsseemed capable of industry unwearied and investigation themost constant and

atand applaudi determined for reasons that i shall presently have occasionto unfold that my first visit should be to my daughtersat my paternal estate of st leon i proposed to spendtwo or three days in preparations for this journey bymere accident by a most censurable heedlessness i becamein some degree a spectator of the auto da fe in which iwas destined to have been a victim unawares i had becomeentangled in the crowd and could with difficultyescape or even prevent my being carried nearer the centreof the scene i saw the galleries and accommodations thathad been erected for the spectators i saw the windows androofs of the houses crowded with beholders the shrieksof the sufferers i could not hear they were drowned in theinfernal exultations of the multitude but what was worstof all i discerned some of the condemned fixed as theytravels op st leon were upon small boards near the top of stakes about fouryards high and therefore greatly above the heads of theassembly while the flames abundantly fed with faggots anddry fuel climbed aloft and seemed eager to embrace theirvictims as i have already said there were thirty of thesedeathdevoted frames and if my eye did not count themall my fancy well supplied what sense was unable to discoverthe impression i felt at that moment was horriblebeyond all conception i exerted my newfound strengthand pushed out of the press with irresistible vigour if atthat instant i could have felt exultation even in the consciousnessof my own safety i should regard myself as themost execrable of monsterschapter xxxivthe first employment in which i purposed to engage mynewfound liberty and youth was a visit to my daughtersi now carried a disguise perpetually about with me thatwould render my journey incapable of proving injurious tothem my daughters were all that remained if indeed theystill remained of my once idolised family for twelveyears i had continued totally ignorant of their fortune andeven of their

anxieties of afather if it had been otherwise deprived as i had beenof the common benefits of light and air and cast out fromthe society of mankind i could have obtained no intelligenceof their welfare in visiting i determined not tomake myself known to them yet notwithstanding thegreatness of this disadvantage i felt that one of the mostexquisite gratifications the earth could afford me was tobehold my children what a multitude of adventures andincidents might they not have encountered in the space oftwelve years imagination and affection dwell impatientlyon the interval nor can any thing quiet the conjectures ofa a travels of st leonhim that loves short of the most complete informationwhat a difference must twelve years have produced in thevery persons and figures of creatures

converseintimately with them without being discovered whileit cut me off from many pure and ingenuous pleasuresadded in some respects a new relish to the indulgence forit gave it a character singular and perhaps unprecedentedin the history of mankind i anticipated with eager transportthe hour at which i should revisit the place of mybirth wander amidst the shades where my careless infancyhad strayed recognise objects made sacred to my heart byassociations with my venerable mother and my adorablewife now illumined with the presence of my childrenand steal a joy unsuspected and unknown to which thevery secrecy with which it was ravished would give atenfold gusti embraced the nearest route by pampeluna and thepyrenees to the banks of the garonne one particularpleasure that i reaped during this tour which the climateand scenery might alone have rendered delightful consistedin the youthful sensation with which every thing i sawwas enjoyed every one who can call to mind the amusementsof his childhood will be conscious that during thatperiod all his senses were in a tone adapted to convey themost exquisite gratification this is not merely as isvulgarly supposed the result of the novelty and freshnesswith which at that time every thing strikes us the extremitiesof the nerves are in a state of the most delicatesusceptibility upon which no touch however slight andevanescent is lost and which makes us upon every occasionfavourable to enjoyment gasp and tremble with thepleasure we imbibe we feel it thrilling through everypulse and communicating its tone to every part our attravelsof st leon mention is engrossed by a single object or if we aresensible to accompanying incidents it spreads over theman animating sunshine and totally varies their appearanceand hue age on the contrary imperceptibly bringsalong with it callosity and sluggishness of sensation outgratifications are coldly relished and our desires feeblyawakened such is the difference in our perception ofdelicious fruits of fragrant smells of smooth and glossysurfaces of the vividness of colour and the heavenlysweetness of sound if this be a just account i leave thereader to imagine how i enjoyed my tour from valladolidto the beautiful and romantic retirement of st leonthere was however one sentiment with which i was atthis time impressed that i shall find it difficult to makethe reader understand in the extent in which i felt it andthat formed a powerful drawback upon the pleasures i havejust described a short time ago i had been old now iwas young i had quaffed of the elixir of immortalitythe revolution this had produced in my sentiments wasnot less memorable than that which it had effected in mycorporeal lineaments and my mental elasticity it is sodifferent a thing to conceive a proposition theoreticallyand to experience it in practice the case is parallel tothat of the expectation which an ordinary christian entertainsof eternal bliss it is

up into the third heaven andhad beheld the new jerusalem with all its jaspers its chrysalisits emeralds and its sapphires my situation was similar to this i had long known asfar as reflection could assure me of it that i possessed thea a travels of st leonelixir of immortality but never till now had i felt thejulep tingling in my veins and known the effects of it inevery joint and articulation of my frame i before believedi now felt that i was immortal the consequence of thisintimate persuasion was not without its portion of melancholyi still bore the figure and lineaments of a humancreature but i knew that i was not what i seemed therewas a greater distance between me and the best constructedand most consummate of the human species than there isbetween him and an ant or a musket crushed by the firstaccidental tread or consumed by the first spark wafted bythe wind i can no longer cheat my fancy i know thati am alone the creature does not exist with whom i haveany common language or any genuine sympathies societyis a bitter and galling mockery to my heart it only showsin more glaring colours my desolate condition the neareri attempt to draw any of the nominal ties of our naturethe more they start and shrink from my grasp from thismoment i could not shake off the terrible impression of myhmelines no not for an hour often does this impressioninduce me to regard my immortality with loathing indescribable often do i wish to shelter myself from it in thesweet oblivion of the grave from this hour i had nopassions no interests no affections my heart has neverexpanded with one natural emotion i have never deliveredmyself up to the repose of one genuine amusement if atany time i have had a glimpse of pleasure it has irritatedonly to deceive it has increased the appetite while it displayedin stronger colours my impotence to gratify itwhat is worse every added year has still subtracted somethingfrom the little poignancy and relish which the bowlof human life continued to retain i have the power ofassuming a youthful and glossy appearance whenever i thinkproper but this is only a bitter mockery of the furrowsploughed in my heart in so much of my adventures asremains for me to describe i feel that i shall be obliged toemploy the established terms of human description i cannotinterrupt the history of my sensations by a recital ofthose pangs by which they have been every moment interruptedthe terms i must use may delude the reader intotravels of st leon an imagination that i still participate of enjoyment and ofhope be it so they may cheat the reader they cannotcheat myself previously to my arrival in the vicinity of the garonnei equipped myself in the habit of an armenian and assumedthe character of a merchant travelling from countryto country for the sale of his commoditiesit was in the close of a wintry day in the bleak andcheerless month of december that i first viewed from adistance the turrets of st leon i procured myself accommodationsfor the night in the adjoining village beingnow after so long an absence within reach of the residenceof these lovely treasures i sought without any direct consciousnessof the sentiment to delay our interview wheni entered the little auberge sheltered under a small plantationof olives i dreaded to hear the repetition of my familyname i longed most fervently to be informed of the welfareof my daughters yet i could have died sooner thanutter a single question on the subject i found that thatardent love which had urged me with rapid steps from valladolidto st leon gradually as the distance grew littlechanged from an impetuous vehemence to hear of and tosee them to fearful awestruck motionless anxiety theirlight and airy figures as i last saw them at montauban in danced before the eyes of my imagination whatcasualties what calamities might not have overtaken themsince i was afraid almost to breathe lest i should dissolvethe unreal scene that played around me how did i knowthat i did not indulge this cheerful imagination for the lasttime again and again in the course of the evening i feltas if i could have wasted ages in this auberge and theneighbouring fields still believing that my daughters inhabitedyonder towers still hovering round their fanciedresidence but never daring to utter their name lest it shouldbe found the prelude to some fatal intelligence how richand refined a repast in some cases is uncertainty it had thepower to impart to these precious pledges a share of that immortalityof which i was the destined monopolistwhy had i not the courage never to overpass the limitat which i was now arrived and wherever i afterwardsaa travels of st leonwandered on the various surface of the globe still to beable to repeat to myself the complacent whisper i havevisited my daughters in their separated abode and my visitwas productive of none but agreeable sensations mypassions were too much afloat to suffer me really to rest inthis patient contemplative gratification before the morning'sdawn i walked forth and turned my eyes towardsthe castle i loitered from bank to bank and from pointto point daylight slowly broke in upon me but all wassilent and quiet in my paternal chateau the family isnot yet stirring said i to myself i turned my steps tothe spot where the ashes of my mother were mingled withtheir parent earth the time that had intervened sinceher decease the various fortunes and impressions i hadexperienced had somewhat obliterated the vividness of herpicture in my memory and deadened the tremblingness ofsensation with which i once thought of her yet enoughwas left to make it an interesting moment to me when ikneeled at her tomb why oh why as it had been withmy great forefathers was it not a moment of exultation tomewhen i thus feelingly saluted the shade of a parent he that exults in such an hour must feel that he hasillustrated his birth and honoured his progenitors i haddone nothing of this i was an exile on the face of theearth had acquired no trophies and accumulated no famei had none to honour none even to know me i had nofamily i had no friend these bitter recollections startedup in array before me and cut me to the heart the spiritof my mother frowned upon her son and i returned alongthe path by which i came disgraced and disconsolatei am now said i in a fit temper to learn intelligenceof my daughters if they have been unhappy tohear it will not make me more forlorn if they have beenfortunate that knowledge and that alone may revive mycourage i hastened towards the avenue i looked intothe thickets and winding paths as i passed they communicatedto me mingled pictures of my own boyish daysand of the amusements of the present inhabitantsi told the nature of my pretended traffic to the servantsof the house and proposed an exhibition of my commodusof st leon ties i was admitted as i desired to the apartment oftheir mistresses i saw two young ladies who appearedto be respectively about twentyeight and twentyfour yearsof age and whom without much difficulty i recognised formy daughters louisa and marguerite their situation andtheir ages identified them and when afterwards i came toperuse their features attentively i could easily discovertraits of the amiable young woman and the playful childthey had been when last we parted i found them employedupon a piece of embroidery a comely and respectablelooking young woman a servant was sewing in anotherpart of the room every thing about the ladiesbespoke the ease of their circumstances and the proprietyof their sentiments both had on an elegant morninghabitboth had an air of sedateness and sobriety that tomy apprehension told that they had not lived

customersat their own house i attempted to speak my tonguerefused its office my legs tottered as if sustaining an unusualweight louisa observed me and desired me to beseated i had no power of choice i accepted her civilityno sooner was i seated than in spite of myself a flood oftears gushed from my eyes she was astonished shebegged to know if i were indisposed she requested me tomake use of every

beproper to mention was not that of a vulgar pedlar it wastall graceful and ingenuous with a certain air of refinementand politeness my armenian dress though formedof unjustly materials was such as to display my person toconsiderable advantage both the young ladies showeda a travels of st leonthemselves interested in the symptoms of my distressafter a few minutes internal struggle i rose made an excusefor the abruptness of my departure and requestedpermission to repeat my visit in the afternoon when ishould have something not unimportant to communicate tothemi had seen two of my daughters had been satisfiedthat they still existed i had witnessed their exterior healthand beauty as i withdrew i laid my hand upon my heartand congratulated myself thus far said i it is well i felt relieved from part of the weight that lay there withmy right hand i struck upon my forehead but oh wherecried i ff is my other daughter the thought came overme with the force of a demonstration she is dead aservant was attending me to the door i requested to speakto the housekeeper i was introduced to mariana chabotshe was struck with my appearance as i believe my daughtershad been as if my features were those of some personwith whom she was intimately acquainted she wouldprobably have mistaken me for my own son but that ilooked considerably too young i intreated her to pardonmy curiosity but i assured her i had a particular reason tointerest myself in the family of monsieur st leon and itherefore requested that she would have the goodness toinform me of their affairs as far as she could with proprietycommunicate them to a person who was not sohappy as to be in the catalogue of their acquaintance itold her that i had just seen two of her ladies but that ihad understood there had been three and i particularly desiredsome information as to the young lady who had notmade her appearance in the parlour my presentiment wastrue the impression that smote me when i left the parlourwas her funeral knell my beloved julia was dead she had been dead four years if it had not been for theagitation of my mind when i visited the tomb of myvenerable parent i should have discovered her monumentnear that of her grandmother that would have been toooverwhelming a mode of learning the painful intelligence i was glad at least to have escaped that in this and some subsequent conversations i held withtravels of st leon selthis respectable matron i learned a variety of particularsrespecting my daughters madame chabot expressed herselfsorry that she had nothing pleasing to communicateher young ladies had been pursued by a train of misfortunesthough heaven knew they had merited every happinessa few years after they had been settled at st leonjulia had been addressed by a lover in every sense worthyof her he was rich noble of a gallant spirit of a cultivatedunderstanding and a truly kind and affectionateheart their attachment had been long and tried habitand experience of each other's virtues had caused it to takea deep root the father of the young man had destinedhim to marry the daughter of a duke and peer of thekingdom but finding his affections unalterably fixed hehad at length yielded and sanctioned their mutual passionwith his consent every thing was now prepared for thenuptials a day was fixed and the appointed time was fastapproaching just at this juncture the father changed hismind and became more obstinate and inexorable than evera report had begun to be circulated that monsieur st leonthe father of the young ladies was still alive madamechabot expressed her fear that this report had originated insome indiscretion of bernardin who however had alwaysproved himself a most zealous and faithful servant and whohad since paid the debt of nature be that as it mightthe father of the lover of julia was found no longer accessibleto expostulation or entreaty he was of an avariciousdisposition and he regarded the fortune of the young ladywhich would otherwise have been considerable as entirelyalienated and annihilated by this flaw in the title butwhat was more material it by no means accorded with hisideas of nobility and honour that the fatherinlaw of hisonly son should be a fugitive and a wanderer with whoseresidence no one was acquainted and of whom no onecould tell whether he were living or dead the mannerin which the ladies had entered into the repossession oftheir paternal estate when minutely investigated wasthought to have something in it of an ambiguous and unpleasantnature it was well known that monsieur st leonhad left the country in consequence of his having ruinedtravels of st leonhimself by the vice of gaming surely said some it isa little mysterious how his children came after an intervalof nine years to be able to repurchase all he ever possessedin short the more the old vicomte was reasoned with themore furious he grew at length he made use of thepower which the government of france vests in the fatherof a family and shut up his son in one of the royal prisonsthis was a fatal blow both to the chevalier and hismistress disappointed in the object of his warmest affectionsmaltreated and disgraced by the severity of a fatherhis health sensibly declined nothing however could shakethe inflexibility of the vicomte he would release his sonupon no other terms than a renunciation of his love termswhich the sense of dignity and honour in the young gentlemanequally with his passion forbade him to accept toall representations of the necessity of granting liberty tohis son if he would not make himself answerable for hisdeath the vicomte sternly replied that he preferred hisdying to the idea of his connecting himself with a familyof dishonour it was not till a few weeks before he expiredthat the father had consented to his release fromprison and had removed him to one of his castles in aremote province but the malady of the chevalier wasfound incurable the vital principles of the system werefatally deranged the lover died and the consequencesof this unhappy affair had put a premature close to theexistence of the unfortunate julia madame chabot addedthat the circumstance of this story having become a subjectof public animadversion it had had a most unfavourableeffect on the prospects of the surviving sisters they boretheir situation with dignity but they could not but feelthe unhappy coincidence which cut them off from thehappiest condition of human life an honourable and wellassorted settlement in marriagewhile madame chabot related to me the tragical historyof julia i felt convulsed with passion and more than onceburst into an agony of tears fatal legacy atrocious secretsof medicine and chemistry every day opened to my astonishedand terrified sight a wider prospect of their wastefuleffects a common degree of penetration might havetravels of st leon sshown me that secrets of this character cut off their possessorfrom the dearest ties of human existence and renderhim a solitary cold selfcentered individual his heart nolonger able to pour itself into the bosom of a mistress or afriend his bosom no longer qualified to receive upon equalterms the overflowing of a kindred heart but no mereexercise of imagination nothing short of the actual experiencethrough which i had passed could have adequatelyrepresented the mischiefs of a thousand variousnames that issued from this pandora's box this extract ofa universal panacea i regarded myself as the murderer ofthese two lovers than whom i concluded from my personalobservation of the one and all that i heard of theother two purer and more affectionate beings more singularlyqualified to form each other's happiness had neverexisted i felt as truly haunted with the ghosts of those ihad murdered as nero or caligula might have been mywife my son my faithful negro and now in addition tothese the tender julia and her unalterable admirer i possessedthe gift of immortal life but i looked on myself asamonster that did not deserve to existit is with difficulty that i shall be able to make thereader understand how much more severe the impressionof this last catastrophe was made to me by the place andtime in which i received the intelligence we are creaturesof sensation our worst calamities derive as much of theirpungency from the accessories by which they are accompaniedas they do from their intrinsic evil if i had heardthis story at any other period i am persuaded its effectswould not have been half so painful the idea of mydaughters was faded in my sensorium and whatever relatedto them though really felt and felt like a fatherwould have been felt with a less overpowering interestbut now i had journeyed from valladolid to the garonneto behold them i had surveyed the castle they inhabitedi had viewed the garden which they arrangedwith their hands i had entered the parlour which theyadorned with their presence all this controlled the operationof absence and of distance i felt at this momentas if i had been accustomed to see them every day and to travels of st leonregard them as inseparable from my existence i experiencedas it were the united effect of familiarity andnovelty i felt the melancholy fate of julia with all thekeenness of an inmate and all the surprise of a long absenttraveller the very metamorphosis i had undergone gavenew poignancy to my distress madame chabot torturedme deliberately and at leisure without the slightest consciousnessof what she was doing she believed she waspouring a tale of persons unknown into the ears of a nativeof the other hemisphere at the moment that she was callingup in arms the strongest and most excruciating feelings ofa father for his child i on the other hand had the mostviolent struggle with myself while i endeavoured to suppressthe appearances of an emotion which to the personwho witnessed them must have been for ever unaccountableas it was and in spite of all my efforts madame chabotbetrayed no little amazement at the agitation with which ilistened to a story in which as she apprehended i couldhave no personal interestwhat i heard from madame chabot suggested to me aconduct which i resolved to adopt under the present circumstancesin my next interview i told louisa that iwould now account to her for emotions which at the timethey occurred must have appeared somewhat extraordinaryi owned that i had been acquainted with her father i saidthat i had first met with him in a journey in which i wasthen engaged through the province of mesopotamia thati had received from him though a stranger a singularobligation that a sincere friendship between us had beenthe result of this event that he died about two years sincethat i had attended him in his last moments that he hadcharged me with his dying recommendations and requests and that my present journey into france had principallybeen instigated by a desire to visit his children i thendelivered into her hands various letters and papers which ihad counterfeited chiefly with the intention of supplying mydaughters with legal evidence of the decease of their fatherlouisa listened to what i related with those marks of affectionand sorrow which are inseparable from the habitsof a well constituted mind the emotion she discoveredtravels of st leon led me farther than i first intended i was urged by anirresistible impulse to practise beyond what the occasiondemanded upon the feelings of her virtuous mind i knownot whether this is to be considered as a vain refinementand a criminal curiosity but i think every generousspirit will excuse me when it is recollected that this covertand imperfect proceeding was all that was left me to soothethe impatient cravings of a father's heart from time totime i reminded her of particulars that it was scarcely possibleany one but her father should know i conjured uppast scenes i made all the revolutions of her youth passsuccessively in review before her i touched all the pulsesof her soul sometimes she was fixed in mute astonishmentat the exactness of my information and was ready todome homage as some aerial genius who condescended toclothe himself in this earthly figure at other times astonishmentwas swallowed up in feeling her soul dissolved in tendernessand she appeared ready fl to faint into my arms it isscarcely possible to depict the pleasurable sensations i drewfrom these intercourse i know not whether they wereentirely innocent but this i know that in me they produceda sentiment of innocence and a sentiment of paradisei felt sometimes as if i could have wasted ages in this sortof gratificationas the executor of their father my daughters receivedme with every mark of respect but after having alreadyprotracted my visit to them for the space of many days ifelt that i should be guilty of something alike hostile totheir decorum and reputation if i did not speedily bring itto a termination i was a person unknown and almostwithout a name nor could it be proper for a young womanto continue to receive the visits of a person of her own ageand a different sex upon the intimate and confidentialfooting upon which my visits were paid except in the caseof him whom she intends to make her husband to considerationsof this sort i was obliged to sacrifice the gratificationsin which i had lately been indulging my principalconcern at st leon from the time in which madamechabot had communicated to me the real nature of mydaughter's situation was to r pt nave those disadvantages in travels op st leonwhich my destiny and my errors had involved them itwould therefore have been the extreme of inconsistency inme while i was healing one mischief to prepare for themanother it is not indeed probable that i should long havebeen contented for myself with this anomalous and neutralsituation in which i more resembled a piece of furnitureendowed with the faculty of noting the sensations of thosearound me than the member of any human society itwas high time as i thought even in this point of viewthat i should put an end to the inglorious scene should appearin some real character and engage in some real undertakinginfluenced by these considerations i now quitted the residenceof my daughters i had satisfied the longing curiosityof a father had seen their situation had witnessedtheir beauty their accomplishments and their virtues ifi had been afflicted at hearing of the premature fate of myeldest daughter if i had been agonised by the reflectionthat i might justly regard myself as her murderer who wasso fitted to suffer this anguish as myself the outcast of myspecies what right had i to expect to be happy in my ownperson or prosperous in any of my relations the guiltycause of all this mischief it was but suitable that it shouldbe brought home to my own bosom that it should tear anddistract my own brain add to this i was not without ahope that my journey would not be found useless to thesurvivors by furnishing to them the proper documents tocertify the death of their father i flattered myself that ihad cut them off more effectually than before from all connectionwith my unpropitious destiny and had placed themnearly upon a footing with the other noble and unmarriedheiresses of their native country i have nothing furtherto relate in regard to these two amiable and excellent sistersfrom the time that i quitted st leon upon this occasionto the time in which i am now writing the opportunity ofmaking further enquiries respecting them has not occurredto me if ever it does occur i have only this one wish toentertain which if granted will i am sure satisfy myfondest hopes may i find they have been as happy asthey so well deserve to be travels of st leonthe parting between me and my daughters was not anaffecting one on my part whose bosom was fraughtwith a thousand tender feelings to which i could give nolanguage and of which those whom they principally concernedhad not the slightest suspicion it could not be affectingnor did louisa and her younger sister look withan indifferent eye upon the bearer of the last sentiments oftheir father the witness of his death the executor of hiswill there was something in the features of my countenancea peculiar sort of conformation a family resemblanceto themselves which it is probable they did not advert tobut which i am persuaded wrought within them to the fullextent of the mysterious sympathies of our nature i pretendedto have been the familiar confident of their father itold them of things at which they started and almost blushedto think that any one beyond the circuit of their dearestrelations should have been privy in the hour of our separationthey shed many tears and embraced me with awarmth that might have well become sisters to a brotheryet shall i confess my weakness a weakness in which ido not apprehend myself to be singular it happens tofew men to witness the manner in which the story of theirown deaths is received if it did i believe we all of ushave enough of vanity and personal feeling however sincerea grief might show itself in the demeanour of survivors tofind it falling short of our appetites and demand this iknow i was myself a party to this unreasonableness mydaughters received the intelligence of my death with a decorumand sensibility which in the eyes of every impartialspectator would have reflected honour on their charactersa sensibility beyond what could have been imagined indaughters who now had not seen their father for twelveyears yet it was an unpleasing reflection to me thus tohave occasion to gauge their love and to say this is theexact measure of their affection i remained in this part ofthe world long enough to see my children consoled andmyself forgotten selfimportance of man upon how slighta basis do thy gigantic erections repose travels op st leonchapter xxxvfrom st leon i proceeded to the kingdom of hungaryto complete this journey i must pass through near twentydegrees of longitude but that was a trivial consideration what i most desired was to gain a new situation and enterupon an untried scene i had determined in my next experimentupon the endowments of the stranger to make nohalfformed efforts and to suffer no mischiefs that drewtheir source from my own irresolution i determined asi have said to forestall all opposition by my firmness andto silence all objectors by the display of a more than princelymagnificence i thought it therefore eligible to remove toa scene where no encounter with any one i had ever knownmight abash me and no relation of any adventure i had evermet should follow me the change of my figure it is truewould render an encounter of this sort of little moment tomy liberty or my

in a conditionlike this he is tempted to wonder that the inhabitants stillretain the courage to bestow on their fields any sort of cultivationand that the licensed or the unlicensed robber stillfinds something over which to extend the fangs of hisrapacityi had not long passed the gates of vienna before i beganto observe the symptoms of that which i had comefrom the pyrenees and the garonne to visit the farther advanced the more melancholy was the scene i beheldthe country in some places entirely deserted villages laidin ashes cities reduced to the dimensions and insignificanceof villages

a ferdinand and a solyman i proceeded as i had originally determined to do tobuda the metropolis of the kingdom it was in the handsof the turk it was of little importance to me whetherthe monarch of the soil were a mahometan or a christian my mind was engrossed by considerations of a very differentmagnitude i came to relieve and assist to the utmostof my power the inhabitants of the country in the extremityof their distressi had not proceeded thus far without bestowing a certainstrictness of reflection on the subject i easily saw thatif i would confer a substantial benefit on this unfortunatenation i had scarcely any other means for the purposethan that of reviving among them a spirit of industry iwas aware that in the strictness of the term money wasnot wealth that it could be neither eaten nor drunk thatit would not of itself either clothe the naked or shelter thehouseless and that it was unable but by a circuitousoperation to increase the quantity of provisions or commoditiesthat the country afforded it was my businesstherefore not to proceed idly in the distribution of goldbut to meditate seriously my plan of operationsi fixed myself in a spacious and beautiful mansion inthe capital this in the present distressed and depopulatedcondition of hungary it was not difficult to procurethe house i selected had for centuries been the principalresidence of the illustrious family of ragotski but thepresent representative of that family after having seen hissons one after another killed in the battles of his countryand his estates ruined by military depredation had foundhimself compelled to fly in his old age and had taken refugewith a distant branch of the same house in the greatduchy of lithuania it was not necessary for me toproceed to any great extent in the first instance in the manufactureof my wealth i had every facility for addingto my store from time to time as circumstances shoulddemandtravels of st leon i determined to open my operations with the article ofbuilding there was sufficient need of it one half ofthe houses through most of the districts of lower orwestern hungary in particular were ruined and untenantablei did not begin with erecting palaces i felt thatthe firstjfclaimants in the present emergency were the peasantand the cultivator i was more desirous that therustic than the prince should be well lodged and accommodatedprovided with the means of rest after fatigueand secured against the invasion of ungenial seasonsmy reasons for beginning with building were these itwas my purpose to stimulate and revive the industry of thenation i was desirous of doing this with the least practicableviolence upon the inclinations and freedom of the inhabitantshad i required of those to whom i addressedmyself that they should fertilise the earth the seeds withwhich it should be impregnated might be wanting i shouldhave a nice balance to adjust between what was necessaryfor immediate subsistence and what might be applied asthe basis of future a point better left to its spontaneouslevel i might be impeded and controlled by a thousandcircumstances and at every step but the materials ofbuilding are to be found in every country no seasons canimpair no malignity of man can annihilate them whereeverthere are quarries there is stone wherever there isclay there are the means of manufacturing bricks i wasanxious to leave the rest of the great process of humanaccommodation to its course while i employed labourersand paid them their wages there would be in the mildestand most salutary mode a continual influx of money intothe market the increase of the precious metals wouldgive new alacrity to the operations of traffic the buyerswould come forward with double confidence the venderswould be eager to meet the activity and spirit of the demandardour and hope would revisit the human mind and the industry i created and the accommodations of onekind at least to which i gave birth would inoculate theother

with the happiest auspicessome time however must necessarily elapse between theperiod of impregnating the soil and that of the future harvestthough i laid it down therefore as a law to myselfto commit the least practicable violence upon the genuineaction of human society in pursuit of the means of subsistencei thought proper in a certain degree to engage inthe importation of corn from poland silesia and otherneighbouring countries this seemed an eligible measureif it were only that i might show others the way and excitethem by my example i procured agents i extendedmy concerns in various directions over the navigable rivers i formed magazines it would have been contrary to thegenius of my undertaking either to make a gratuitous distributionof what i purchased or to sell it at such lowprices as to drive other speculators whose spirit of enterprisemight happily cooperate with mine out of the markethowever indifferent i might feel to the receipt ofpecuniary compensation it was necessary that in the concernsof barter and trade i should assume the exterior ofa merchantnor did i wholly confine my exertions within the occupationsof an architect and a corndealer these orrather the former of the two i regarded as my true andgenuine province but i did not so far enslave myself tomy own maxims as to negative in all instances the directdemands of want i was not anxious to convert a nationor an army of men into my personal adherents and retainers i was rather desirous to avoid this as a dangeroussource of obloquy i did not therefore always decline bypretended loans to assist other men to employ labourers aswell as myself to act upon their own designs and prosecutetheir own fortune the cries of the poor man the widowand the orphan were sometimes too importunate and toowell justified by their unquestionable necessities to allowme to withhold from them my alms in a few instancesi conveyed my supplies anonymously to persons whosedignity of birth or whose proud

understanding the powers by which i actedthey blindly ascribed to me the faculty of doing whatever ipleased as long as every thing went on prosperouslythey were grateful the moment a reverse occurred theywere inclined to murmur they made no allowance for thelimited capacities of a human creature they imputedwhatever was unpleasing to indifference or ill will theprice of commodities after having for a while becomemoderate now rapidly rose again this was partly the consequenceof the increased quantity of the precious metalsby means of which any assignable sum bore a less proportionto the provisions of the market than it had donebefore bread was at a very high price and it occasionallyhappened to buyers who did not come early enoughthat there was no bread to be purchased the doors of thehouses where it was sold were besieged the industriouspoor appeared before them with the first faint dawn of themorning's light here they consumed hours of painfulexpectation in grievous addition

of purchasing breadbrought together at certain hours when assembled naturallyentered into the discussion of their present discontentsthey were not satisfied with the discourse and jostling ofthe

their dissatisfactionwith the inconsequence incident to the lower orders ofmankind they threatened to destroy the mills the marketsthe places of sale the means and materials by which theirwants were to be suppliedin the midst of these scenes of tumult and confusion itis not to be imagined that i escaped uncensured farotherwise in proportion to the gratitude and adorationwith which they had lately regarded me were their detestationand abhorrence now my interference was spokenof with contempt and execration for what purpose hadi a foreigner come into their country and intruded myselfinto their affairs why had i impiously taken them outof the hands of their heavenly father whose care was soconstant and whose relief so certain it was on my part adespicable vanity and presumption which the justice ofprovidence could not fail to avenge and they must nowsuffer the punishment of my blasphemy but they did notstop here there was no horrible calumny which they didnot invent or give credit to against me they imputed tomethe basest personal motives for what i had done underthe hypocritical pretence they cried of being their benefactorand saviour i was using them only for my private endsi had become a purchaser and vender of corn for the singlepurpose of increasing my fortune the present scarcitythey were well assured was artificial and of my own contrivingi had magazines in different stations on the borderswhich when the price was risen to the standard of myavarice and when half the people had fallen victims to myinhumanity i purposed to dispose of to an immense profitsuch were the aspersions to which my character becamegenerally exposed by the populace who now experiencedthe unsatisfied cravings of hunger and in whom my protravelsof st leon meetings had excited hope only to

is to he feared that no man canbe assiduous and indefatigable in the service of otherswithout incurring that consequence i employed a greatnumber of workmen every one whom for whatever reasoni refused to employ every one who being unqualified forthe service i required looked with an envious eye on thebetter fortune of his neighbour was well disposed to be myenemy persons of no contemptible account in the communityhad been excited by expectations of profit toengage in the importation of corn these persons viewedmy efforts in the same department with a suspicious eyeand regarded a man who however cautious in his proceedingswas not regulated by the same motive as a most perniciousrival my sudden elevation and importance in thecountry were viewed with not more astonishment thanaversion by those whose importance i obscured they couldnot hear with patience of an upstart a boy a strangerone universally unknown elbowing out the influence ofall that was most illustrious and venerable in the communityand robbing them daily of their adherents andretainers all these persons left no effort untried to defamemy characterthe impulse once given the turbulent disposition of thepopulace became every day more formidable it is mucheasier to disseminate a temper of this sort than to quell it my opulent foes might take alarm at its excesses and desireto undo what they had done but it was beyond theirpower every day i feared lest from threats and invectivesthe populace should proceed to violence every nighti thought i had reason to congratulate myself that the dayhad passed without waste and spoil committed by them onthe means of their subsistence or was not marked with thedestruction of their champion and benefactor in someplaces a sort of petty sedition broke out among the labourersi employed in the morning they refused to work whyshould a man work they muttered when after all he maytravels of st leonstarve with the wages of his labour in his possession atnight they became impatient and furious and demandedfrom my superintendents and storehousemen the foodwhich in the morning they had refused to earn and weretherefore now unable to purchase i had already had someexperience in the nature of popular tumults had now nomarchese filosanto at hand to persuade me of their inefficacy and if i had i should no longer have lent an earto his serene and unsuspicious generosity i felt the realityof the danger i saw the storm as it blackened in my horizonand was deeply convinced what it would be if it burstupon my headit may be imagined with what feelings i viewed mywhole design on the point to be subverted by the unrulinessof those for whose benefit it had been planned it is truei had now no darling relations to be involved in my fateno incomparable wife no daughters illustrious in innocenceand beauty yet my feelings were scarcely less pungentthan they had been at the period of my catastrophe at pisai had blamed myself in review that in my experiments atconstance at dresden at pisa and at madrid i had notcommenced upon a sufficiently ample scale but had sufferedmyself to be frustrated by the ingloriousness of my precautionsthat had not been my error in the presentinstance yet my success now promised to be scarcely moreflattering than upon former occasions i had looked forhappiness as the result of the benevolence and philanthropyi was exerting i found only anxiety and a well groundedfear even for my personal safety let no man build on theexpected gratitude of those he spends his strength to serve let him be beneficent if he will but let him not dependfor his happiness on the conviction of his rectitude andvirtue that is to be impressed on the minds of others there is a principle in the human breast that easily inducesthem to regard every thing that can be done for themas no more than their due and speedily discharges themfrom the oppressive consciousness of obligation there isa levity in the generality of men that entails

instances of ingratitude to display in what yet remainsto be related of my storymy nights were restless my thoughts were in armswhat was it that it became me to do in the present emergency sometimes in the bitterness of my heart hatingmyself hating the endowments of the stranger hating arace of beings who denied all credit to the most unheardofexertions for their advantage i determined to withdrawunobserved from my attendants and clients and bid adieuto hungary for ever but whither was i to fly whatwas i to do next what experiment could i make of thepurposes to which to apply the philosopher's stone that ihad not already made these questions to none of whichi could give a satisfactory answer checked the career of mypassion and gave pause to my thoughtswhatever i did i was determined to do nothing rashlynor to quit a great experiment without its having been fullytried it was no light concern no trivial child'splay inwhich i had embarked i had taken the welfare perhapsthe existence of a great and heroic nation under my protectionin this glorious vocation it did not become me tobe lightly discouraged what if those i served and saveddid not show themselves sufficiently sensible to the exertionsi made for them i ought to purify my bosom on anoccasion like this from base and ignoble motives and todeem myself sufficiently recompensed by my conscious virtuewhat if the service in which i had engaged nowappeared to be a service of hazard and peril is thereany great undertaking that can be separated from this condition if hastily from cowardice from pique or fromany other motive i deserted the business on which i hadentered what was to become of my mistaken indeed butinthat case most unfortunate clients the greater wasthe crisis to which they were exposed the more were unremittedvigilance and uncommon powers necessary to guidethem amidst its rocks and its quicksands i saw thousandsof men who for several weeks had fed as it were from thestores of my bounty by a propensity inseparable from thehuman heart i became attached to the work of my mediatravels op st leonnations and the labour of my thoughts all their ficklenesstheir injustice even the atrocious calumnies they admittedand propagated against me could not wean myattachment from beings a great portion of whom but formy interference would i believed long ere this have expiredof hungerin the peculiar and urgent circumstances in which ifound myself no expedient was so obvious as that of callingin the interference of the government under which i livedjt was necessary that the resources of national subsistenceshould be defended from the wanton spoil of those whowhen they were annihilated must inevitably perish itwas necessary that the benefactor of hungary who i flatteredmyself was still able to watch effectively for heradvantage should be protected from her misguided resentmentthe alternative was singularly painful to my feelingsthe pride with which my unparalleled endowments inspiredme was deeply wounded when i was compelled to confessthat i was not alone equal to the task i had undertakenand that i must submit to call in a foreign auxiliary iaugured little favourable from the interference of governmentwhich if i implored i could scarcely expect toguide which was not likely to submit to my principle ofrendering its interference the mildest and smallest that thenature of the case would admit but puffed up with presumptionand intoxicated with authority would probablyleave no concern of the public welfare uninvited leastof all could i anticipate much of good from a turkish governmentbut what could i do i could discover noother expedient influenced by the views i have recitedi had hitherto kept myself as far from the observation ofthe political directors of the state as i could but mycautiousness and reserve were now at an end with myeyes open i exposed myself to all the evils that might attendon my proceedingi determined to apply to the bashaw of the provincepreviously to my taking this step i had the precaution toenquire his character he was the genuine offspring of theturkish system of government his name was muzafferbey he was originally a circassian slave then a janistravelsof st leon say and rising by insensible gradation had at length beenappointed bashaw of buda which as being the immediatefrontier between austria and the porte was at this timethe most arduous situation in the gift of the sultan hewas esteemed a good soldier he had been early distinguishedby his dexterity in military exercises he had sinceseen much service j and in every situation in which he wasplaced had earned commendation and honour he wasabstemious and hardy for himself he neither pamperedhis appetites nor shrunk from severity and he had as littleindulgence for those under his command as for his own personyet he was indebted for his present eminence more tothe arts of the courtier than to his merits in the field hischief care had ever been to recommend himself to thoseabove him and to obtain the good will of his equals forthe opinion of his inferiors he gave himself little concernwith considerable ability he laboured under no check fromeither principle or ingenuous pride and therefore wasextremely successful in his attacks on the inclination ofthose he sought the habits of his mind had modified thelines of his countenance and the tones of his voice exceptto his dependants and the poor he almost always spoke witha smile upon his face and his enunciation was silvertonguedoily copious and insinuating if he ever adopteda different manner the variation was only in the meansnot the end and when he seemed to travel by an oppositeroad the goal at which he aimed was the same he neverconsulted any oracle but that of his apparent interest if hehad any insolence in his nature he regarded his slaves andthose under his military command as affording a sufficientsphere for its exercise he had no affections to disturb himfrom his bent he had no passions but the selfcomplacencyof superior cunning and the sordid love of pelfthis account of the man with whom i had to deal wasfar from encouraging but i had no alternative i sent tosignify my desire to confer with him or to speak moreaccurately to ask in the eastern manner when it would beagreeable to him to receive a present of which i requestedhis acceptance he appointed the morning of the followingclay i prepared a gift such as might tend to conciliate hisc c travels of st leonfavour without marking in the donor the possession ofimmoderate wealth it consisted of silks and muslins witha small piece of plate of exquisite workmanship mypresent was borne by two of my servants we wereushered to the bashaw in his private apartment there weretwo or three persons in attendance upon him they examinedmy present together and without condescendingto express much approbation i could nevertheless discernthat the bashaw was pleased with it this ceremony concludedmuzaffer ordered what i had brought to be takeninto a different apartment and every other person withdrawingwe were left alonewhile the bashaw was examining my gift i took theopportunity of considering his person he appeared to beabout sixty years of age his complexion dark and muddyhis features coarse and distorted his mustachios remarkablylarge his person though bony and muscular considerablybelow the middle size and his figure ungainly andungraceful i felt surprised that such a man should everhave been an excellent soldier or have risen from a lowrank to one of the first situations of the empire to lookat him he seemed better formed for the vice of a comedythan the ruler of a nation he raised his eyes towards measkance as he sat leaning on his elbow and saidyou cal yourself the sieur de chatillon and your age is two and twentyte i am glad you are come to me i intended to havesent for you and you have saved me the troublei made many apologies for my intrusion but addedthat i had a petition to prefer and hoped he would favourme with a hearingnot at all not at all do not call it an intrusion itis necessary i should be acquainted with you he proceededyou have undertaken to confer great benefits on thesubjects of the grand signior my master to rescue themfrom famine young rich a stranger unknown to mymaster unknown to his subjects i understand that youtravels op st leon have spared no labour or expense to bring about their welfarethis is really a very extraordinary case your meritis unprecedented i do not feel myself competent to rewarditi answered that i laid no claim to uncommon merit that every temper had its particular gratifications and thati found as real a luxury in the proceedings he had remarkedas other men did in the excesses of the table orthe promiscuous enjoyments of the haremit is out of my power continued he to remunerateyou as you deserve i must send you to constantinoplei perceived that this was the first essay of his artificei informed him which i have no doubt he knew well enoughbefore that i had no desire to go to constantinople iwished to remain where i was and to finish what i hadbegunwhat you have not done then suddenly and withan abrupt voice exclaimed the bashaw by mahomet aman of a reasonable appetite in your place might be satisfiedhave not you filled the streets with riots and thecountry with rebellion do not the populace assemble incrowds insulting every one they meet and talking of nothingbut fire and devastation the bowstring and thediameter be so good my dear sir as to inform me whatfurther you may have in view reverend bashaw cried i with submission yet withfirmness i have none of these things in view but amoment ago you did justice to my intentions they arethose of beneficence and beneficence onlyi know nothing about that i have nothing to dowith honest men's blunders i look to the effects they producethese effects most mighty sir are temporary theyare the clouds that will often obscure for an instant thebrightest sunshine condescend to lend me your generousassistance and all will be welldo not tell me of clouds and sunshine this is tomy thinking not an april shower but an earthquake anda hurricane if we are all to be swallowed up or whirledinto the air it is no consolation to me that the day afterc c travels of st leonwe are gone every thing shall be as fair and serene asparadise itselfremember sir that when i came into hungary ifound its inhabitants in the most desperate condition miserablewasted and starving have i not already suspendedthis evil for months yes i do remember you are one of those busybodieswho never see an evil without imagining they arethe persons to correct it intruding into every thing andsubverting every thing the superintendence of the publicwelfare is a mystery to which none are competent but thosewhom mahomet has raised to the situation of statesmenyour interference is blasphemy against the spirit of ourreligion and deserves to be encountered with the mostexemplary punishment good god then is it in this country a crime to feedthe hungry to clothe the naked and shelter the houselesssieur de chatillon retorted the bashaw you appearto be unacquainted with the maxims of turkish policy thewisest and most beneficent in the world if none of thedisturbances had happened at which i have so much reasonto be alarmed still in relieving the people in the manneryou have done you have incurred the guilt of high treasonagainst the sultan know sir that through the wholeextent of his dominions there is but one proprietorand that is our illustrious monarch you say that youwish to be the benefactor of his subjects and the judge ofyour own proceedings such sentiments are direct rebellionagainst the glorious constitution of ottoman the sovereignof constantinople will have no benefactor in thecountries he presides over but himself like the invisibleruler of the universe he acts by second causes he allowshis ministers to be the instruments of his beneficence butall must be ascribed to him must flow from his will andbe placed under his control you who have formed a planof public benefit without consulting him and have presumedlike a luminary of the world to move in an orbitof your own have in strictness of construction forfeited yourlife to his justice and i consult rather the clemency of histravels op st leon nature than the maxims of his policy if i suffer you to gofrom this palace with your head upon your shoulderswithout permitting myself to be too much moved by theimperious language addressed to me i complained to thebashaw of the rigorous and arbitrary character of what hestated to be the maxims of the turkish government isolemnly protested that i had no private or personal objectin view the effect of my operations would be to givenew strength and energy to his master's dominions bydiffusing happiness among his subjects by reviving industryand scattering plenty prosperity and ease all disaffectionwould be rooted out and the people who are neverminute in scanning the cause of their enjoyments wouldbless the sceptre under which they were made to participatesuch manifold benefits if the policy of the divan led themin any degree to interfere they ought rather to crown mymeasures with their applause than wantonly to throw obstaclesin the way of what i purposed i asked howeverno reward i demanded no favour for myself all i desiredwas that the sultan would assist me in securing to his peoplethose benefits the dissemination of which i had soauspiciously begunthe bashaw without taking any direct notice of thisexpostulation answered that i was not aware of the maximsof his government to which inconsideration of my seeminggenerosity and rectitude he was willing to give the mildestinterpretation it is however continued he to thelast degree idle in you to imagine that you can be permittedto go on unobserved and that the sultan and his representativesare to take no account of your proceeding the greatinstrument for ruling mankind is by their passions andtheir opinions the man from whom they believe theyhave the most to fear and the most to hope will always betheir master whatever be your secret or your professeddesigns you go on from day to day making yourself partisansand enlisting the subjects of the sultan among yourpersonal retainers what security has he for your submissionand loyalty how shall he know that when youh ave acquired the advantages of a powerful leader you willn ot go over to the enemy or in the present distracted concc travels of st leonedition of the province even have the audacity to set up foryourself if therefore by an unexampled clemency ofconstruction i decline to reduce you into the passive machineof my master's will it is at least incumbent on methat i should take account of your powers and possess myselfof the schedule of your property by this means onlycan i watch your progress and take care that you do notsuddenly become too powerful for a subject are you preparedto satisfy me on this head on this question i hesitated for a moment i had notexactly anticipated the enquiry at length i requested thedelay of a few days and then i promised that all his demandsshould be satisfied the bashaw resumed sieur de chatillon i remark your hesitation and idraw from it no favourable augury these indirect andinvoluntary indications are more worthy of my attentionthan all the studied and elaborate information you shallthink proper to give me sir you are a man of darknessand every thing that relates to you is enveloped in mysteryyou come hither with no apparent motive you have noconnections of blood in hungary you have no acquaintancewith any eminent person of the hungarian nation ihave had my spies on you though i have not hithertothought proper to summon you to my presence you havepurchased no property in the province i cannot learn thatyou have any correspondences or resources from abroad ihave been at the pains to procure an account of your expenditureduring the three months you have resided amongus much of that expenditure has been obscure clandestineand indirect but i believe you will find my estimatewhich you are at liberty to inspect and remark upon tolerablycorrect your disbursements for three monthsexceed the amount of two years income of the richest subjectthat even the credulous monarchs of christendom sufferwithin their dominions what am i to think of this howcan i be sufficiently vigilant respecting a man whose expenditureis immense and whose wealth can neither betraced to its source nor ascertained in its amount i was not slow in conjecturing the result which thebashaw proposed to himself from our present conference itravels of st leon was confirmed in my conjecture by the circumstance of hischoosing that the discussion between us should be apartfrom all witnesses he regarded me as a boy and hadtherefore practised upon me all those arts which mightmost effectually excite in me fear and alarm he foundhowever that under the external indications of youth andinexperience i possessed the wariness that added years mostpowerfully inculcate and the selfpossession of a mind thoroughlyawake to its situation and its resources thrusthave been to the minister before whom i stood amemorable phenomenon but curiosity is not a turkishpassion and the single object of the bashaw in the presentinstance was to make the mysteriousness of my circumstancesa pretext for extorting money i submitted withas little seeming reluctance as possible to the necessity ofthe case i requested the good offices of muzaffer to protectmy benefactions and begged permission to make himthe compliment of a handsome sum of money by way ofconvincing him that i was worthy of his friendshipthis business was easily adjusted between us i foundhim perfectly skilled in the duties of a public office andby no means under the dominion of visionary scruples hetold me he was now convinced that i was a well meaningman and a good subject he said that nothing could tendmore effectually to demonstrate my innocence than myshowing that i understood the duties and concerns of aminister of state and that for his own part he was neverso happy as when he was thus able to reconcile his privateinterests with the good and faithful service of his masterthere was nothing that demanded a more unremitted vigilanceor a more skilful management than such a situationas his and it would be most unreasonable either in thesovereign that appointed him or the subjects over whom hewas placed to expect him to be indifferent to the emolumentsand perquisites of his function he complimentedme warmly upon the disinterestedness and liberality of myexertions he thought himself particularly fortunate inhaving so publicspirited an individual within the circuitof his jurisdiction in fine he hoped he should be honouredwith my personal acquaintance and assured me thatc c travels of st leonnothing could make him more happy than the frequent repetitionof my visitswe now perfectly understood one another and it wasapparent that i had to do with a man who for what hedeemed an adequate consideration would willingly lend methe authority and countenance of his office and suffer meto guide him in any of the functions i might conceive necessaryfor the execution of my projects guards wereagreed to be placed upon the magazines where corn wasstill contained and from place to place on the banks ofthe rivers where the depredations of a misguided populacewere most to be apprehended finding the bashaw soperfectly willing to comply with my requisitions i furtherobtained from him the direction of several squadrons ofcavalry for the protection of the crops which from the consequencesof my interference now began on all sides tovariegate the scene this was a most important servicewhen the corn was first committed to the earth it was outof the reach of military devastation but as time glidedsilently on the case became materially altered the enemymight from forecast desire to reap the harvest of what hehad not sown or from malice to destroy that without whichthe turk would perhaps be unable to retain his newly acquiredterritory this had in reality been the principalcause before my arrival in hungary of the very generalneglect into which agriculture had fallen muzaffer thanwhom no person could now be more polite and condescendingallowed me to determine the number and nature of thetroops i required and added that though he could notopenly put them under my direction the slightest intimationi might think proper to convey to him should at anytimedecide their march and regulate their quarterschapter xxxviiin my conference with the bashaw i may seem to havesecured more than j one point of material importance travels op st leon yet it was difficult for any man to be in a state less consolatoryor more full of danger and menace than i was atthis moment by my vigilance and the power which thusi had acquired i prevented indeed the inhabitants fromwantonly destroying the means of their own subsistence but the more i was their benefactor the more i appearedto become odious to their thoughts my negotiation withthe bashaw whatever other benefit might accrue from itdid not tend to increase the resources of the country i wasobliged to witness many scenes of wretchedness he thatwould assist mankind in their adversity must harden hisheart to be the spectator of the distress that he can and thathe cannot relieve but whatever i beheld of this sort themajority of the bystanders obstinately persisted to ascribeto my deliberate malignity the military aid i found myselfnecessitated to introduce by no means tended to disarmthe prejudices of my clients in one or two instances butno more slight tumults arose and a few of the rioters fellaprey to their own wickedness and folly these misfortuneswere cast as reproach upon me arid i was pursuedwith clamours and curses i found it requisite to obtain aguard for my person i was abhorred by those for whomall my vigilance was exerted and insulted by the mouthsthat i supplied with the necessaries of existencenor was this my only source of alarm and uneasiness inmy present situation i was by no means a dupe to theostentatious civility of the bashaw i perfectly understoodhis insinuation when he invited the frequent repetition ofmy visits i knew that however dearly i purchased hisfriendship and patronage i should still have to purchasethem again and again his extortions upon me admittedof no limits except from his own modesty or the estimatehe might form of my invisible resources bribery itselfafforded me no complete security and now that i had becomean object of curiosity and remark he had sufficientlyshown me i was at the mercy of his caprice or that of hismaster for my liberty and even for my lifeyet could i have resolved to quit hungary and seekthe protection of some more regular government what benefitshould i derive from a removal mystery was the greattravels op st leonand unconquerable bane of my situation and from the poisonousinfluence of mystery the most regular system ofgovernment was not competent to protect me it would beidle to imagine that in any country on earth a strangerwould be permitted to launch into such expenses as thosein which i was engaged without becoming an object ofsuspicion and being made liable to continual interruptionin his measures yet unless allowed to use the resourcesi possessed of what advantage was it to be the depositoryof wealth without a bound was it to be wished for aman under my circumstances to have a family or to bewithout a family when i had one i found the legacy ofthe stranger robbing me of every comfort of that sort withthe most calamitous aggravations when i was strippedof wife and children though no man could prize those benefitsmore dearly than i prized them i took to myself theconsolation that at least now i should risk no one's happinessbut my own and that for a person exercising myendowments it was perhaps requisite to be free from everyshackle and incumbrance i found however the topic fromwhich i had consoled myself in reality the source of a newmisfortune i had the wealth of a nobleman but i wasdeprived of his adventitious attributes i had no illustriousancestry to boast i had neither lineage nor parent i hadneither wife nor children in whom mutually to reflect andsee reflected the devotedness and generosity of my stationi had not even the ordinary advantage which is within thereach of almost every man of connections and acquaintancefriends handed down to me as a branch of my patrimonialinheritance friends whose value experience enabledme to ascertain and friends with whom long habits of familiarityhad given birth to reciprocal endearment thebashaw had imputed to me the design of forming a partyalas these which are the great materials for cementingparty attachments were totally denied me i had no bondsof alliance but those which money afforded the coarsest themeanest the least flattering and the most brittle of thoseligatures that afford the semblance of uniting man withmantravels of st leon sqchapter xxxviiiaware of the difficulties which unavoidably sprung out ofthe nature of my situation i resolved immediately to endeavourto supply them to the best of my power i conceivedthat there was no consideration so urgent upon meatthe present moment as that i should without loss oftime create to myself connections that might balance andkeep at bay the sallies of arbitrary rule and that i shouldweave with my own hand the cords of friendshipi had no sooner formed this project than an individualsuggested himself to my reflections whom i judged to beby a singular concurrence of circumstances happily fittedto be the subject of my experiment and admirably qualifiedto afford me protection in the most unfavourable eventsthe name of this man was bethlem gabor he had beensome time before brought to me by one of his friends andhe was a man whom for a thousand reasons it was impossibleto see and converse with without receiving the mostindelible impression he was the lineal representative ofone of the most illustrious houses in hungary his vocationlike that of the majority of the hungarian nobilityhad been arms but in the midst of a fraternity all ofwhom were warlike he stood conspicuous and alone hiscourage though cool and deliberate almost mounted to adegree of desperate rashness and the fertility of his inventionand the variety of his stratagems did not fall shortof his courage the celerity of his measures was equallydistinguished distance was no bar to him

invincible to hardship contemnersof fatigue of difficulties of hunger and of thirst whenintroduced to me he was upwards of fifty years of agehe was more than six feet in stature and yet he was builtas if it had been a colossus destined to sustain the weightof the starry heavens his voice was like thunder and he travels of st leonnever uttered a word but it seemed to shake his manly chesthis head and chin were clothed with a thick and shaggy hairin colour a dead black he had suffered considerable mutilationin the services through which he had passed ofone of his hands three fingers were gone the sight of hisright eye was extinguished and the cheek half shot awaywhile the same explosion had burned his complexion into acolour that was universally dun or black his nose wasscarred and his lips were thick and large bethlem gaborthough universally respected for the honour and magnanimityof a soldier was not less remarkable for habits ofreserve and taciturnity but these habits misfortune hadcaused to become more deeply ingrafted in his natureduring one of his military excursions a party of maraudershad in his absence surprised his castle burned it to theground and savagely murdered his wife and childrenand every living creature within the walls the samestroke that rendered him childless made him also a beggarhe had been regarded for his proceedings as an adherentto the turkish standard but he had always tenaciouslymaintained the most complete independence the adversitythat had now fallen upon him was too great hewould not become a pensioner of the sultan despair hadtaken fast possession of his heart he disbanded the bodyof men he had formed and wandered a solitary outcastupon the face of his country for some time he seemed tohave a savage complacence in conceiving that the evil hehad suffered was past all remedy and in spurning at thosepalliations and disguises with which vulgar souls areaccustomed to assuage their woe yet the energy of hisnature would not suffer him to rest he wandered an outcast but every day engendered some new thought or passion and it appeared probable that he would not yet quitthe stage of existence till he had left behind him the remembrancesof a terrible and desolating revengeit may seem strange that such a man as i have describedshould be the indivi dual i selected out of the wholehungarian nation to make my friend it may seem thathis qualities were better adapted to repel than attract mychoice would not appear strange if the reader could havetravels of st leon conversed with him as i did he was hideous to the sightand

refuse to venerate aswell as fear him i never pitied him bethlem gabor'swas a soul that soared to a sightless distance above thesphere of pity i can scarcely say i sympathised with him but when i listened to his complaints rather let me sayhis invectives i was astonished overwhelmed and motionlessthe secret of the effects he thus produced layin his own way of feeling the incidents he described

accessible to human feelingsand human affections listen to his narrative or ratherto the bursts of passion which with him supplied the placeand performed the functions of narrative you would

could not helpadmiring him his greatness excited my wonder and myreverence and while his manners awed and overwhelmedme i felt an inexplicable attachment to his person still increasingin my bosomon his part my kindness and partiality appeared scarcelyless pleasing to bethlem gabor than his character anddiscourse were fascinating to me he had found himselfwithout a confident or a friend his wife and his childrenin a certain degree understood him and though he hadan atmosphere of repulsion beyond which no mortal everpenetrated they came to the edge of that and rested there they trembled involuntarily at his aspect but at the sametime they adored and they loved him the rest of theworld viewed him from a more fearful distance respectedhim but dared not even in fancy be familiar with himwhen therefore he lost his family he lost his all heroamed the earth in solitude and all men made room forhim as he passed i was the first who since the fatalevent that had made him childless and a beggar hadcourted his society and invited his communications ihad dared to take the lion by the paw and seat myselfnext him in his den there was a similarity in our fortunesthat secretly endeared him

the one with the other as perfectly as wecould often over our gloomy bowl we mingled groansand sweetened our draught as we drank it with maledictionsin the school of bethlem gabor i became acquaintedwith the delights of melancholy of a melancholynot that contracted but that swelled the soul of a melancholythat looked down upon the world with indignationand that relieved its secret load with curses and execrationswe frequently continued whole nights in the participationof these bitter joys and were surprised still at our seriousboard by the light of the morrow's suni have now i believe fully accounted for our intimacyand displayed the ligatures that secretly bound us to eachtravels of st leon other it is scarcely necessary to add that ray understandingconfirmed what my heart impelled bethlemgabor appeared to me the fittest man in the world uponwhom to fix for my friend we were qualified mutuallyto benefit each other my kindness my unremitted attentionsthe earnestness with

highlyesteemed he rose above them allfor some time i regarded bethlem gabor as entirelymy friend and i consulted him in every thing in whichcompatibly with the legacy of the stranger of the summerhousei could consult him i told him of the suspicions ofthe bashaw and the precariousness of my safety i demandedhis advice as to the best method of securing itought i to regard it as a more effectual or as a cheaperexpedient to attempt to purchase the countenance of thesultan instead of condescending to bribe his minister ought i to set up for myself and by rendering myself theindependent prince of one of the hungarian provincesdefy the turk or at least endeavour to negotiate with himfrom a more respectable and commanding situation isaid more than enough under these heads as it afterwardsappeared to awaken strange imaginations in a mind of somuch penetration as that of bethlem gabor in fine idemanded of him whether in case of any great and formidabledanger falling on me he would to the utmost of hispower afford me protection when the question was firststarted he swore to me with his customary impressivenessand energy that he wouldwhile i was thus employed in consulting him andopening to him as far as was practicable my prospects andfears did not less succeed in dissipating or suspendingtie despair of his melancholy it was of benefit to himin this respect that by opening to him my affairs i from travels of st leontime to time called off his attention from his personal misfortunesi proposed to him the rebuilding his castle andi at length obtained his permission to send off a corps ofworkmen for that purpose beside the castle in which hiswife and children had been murdered and which themarauders had nearly destroyed he had one considerablystronger though void of all recommendation from cheerfulnessor beauty in the more northerly part of the kingdomthis we visited together i restored the conditionof his fields with considerable difficulty i replaced thecattle he had lost by purchases in poland and i revivedhis dilapidated revenues at first he felt an invinciblerepugnance to the receiving any advantage from the bountyof another but by continual remonstrances i was able to persuadehim that he owed me nothing and that what i didwas no more than was required from me by a regard formy own safetyif ever on the face of the earth there lived a misanthropebethlem gabor was the man never for a moment did heforget or forgive the sanguinary catastrophe of his family and for his own misfortunes he seemed to have vowed vengeanceagainst the whole human race he almost hatedthe very face of man and when expressions of cheerfulnesspeace and contentment discovered themselves in hispresence i could see by the hideous working of his featuresthat his spirit experienced intolerable agonies to himsuch expressions were tones horribly discordant all wasuproar and havoc within his own bosom and the gaiety ofother men inspired him with sentiments of invincible antipathyhe never saw a festive board without an inclinationto overturn it or a father encircled with a smiling familywithout feeling his soul thrill with suggestions of murdersomething i know not what withheld his hand it mightbe some remaining atom of humanity it might be forhis whole character was contemplative and close it mightbe that he regarded that as a pitiful and impotent revengewhich should cause him the next hour to be locked up as amadman or put to death as criminal horrible as was hispersonal aspect and wild and savage as was his mind yetas i have already said i felt myself attached to him itravels op st leon knew that all the unsocial propensities that animated himwere the offspring of love were the sentiments of a lionessbereaved of her young and i found an undescribable andexhaustless pleasure in examining the sublime desolation ofa mighty soulbethlem gabor had at first regarded me with some degreeof partiality kindness in almost all cases begets kindness he could not see how much i interested myself about andhow much i courted him without feeling for me a sentimentdifferent from that he confessed for other men i sawhowever after some time with inexpressible grief that hisregard for me instead of increasing suffered perceptiblediminution our propensities were opposed to each otherhe rejoiced in disorder and desolation as in his congenialelement my present pursuit was the restoration of publicorder and prosperity he repeatedly expostulated with meon this i had sometimes in our conversations in the bitternessof my recollections exclaimed on myself as themost unfortunate and most persecuted of men thoughwithout entering into an explanation of my sufferings hereminded me of these exclamations he reproached me asacontemptible and pusillanimous wretch that i did notlike him resolve amply and memorably to revenge my ownsufferings upon my species at large in his estimate thepoorest and most servile of all maxims was that of theauthor of the christian religion to repay injury with favourand curses with benedictioni perceived with grief that the kindness towards me thathad been excited in bethlem gabor's mind rather declinedthan augmented but i was very far from being aware ofthe degree in which as i afterwards found this sentimenthad relapsed into its opposite it seems i inflicted on hima daily torture by my daily efforts for the dissemination ofhappiness of these he had not been at first completelyaware his mind had been too much absorbed in its ownfeelings to attend very distinctly to any thing i did unlessit were done in his presence but in proportion as isoothed his sorrows and made him my confidant the filmwas removed and all that he saw had the peculiar misfortuneto excite at once his contempt and his rage thed d travels of st leonfinishing stroke that i gave to the animosity which unknownto me was now brooding and engendering in hisbreast consisted in my bestowing an important benefitupon one against whom he had entertained a long andeternal feudchapter xxxixwhile bethlem gabor became every day more confirmedin his antipathy against me i reposed in him an unsuspectingconfidence a confidence more extensive thani had since the singular and fatal acquisition i had madereposed in any other man frequently for a considerabletime together he resided under my roof frequently wewent forth together in those excursions which either myprojects or his views rendered it necessary for us to makein his character of a nobleman of great consideration inhis native country he was now rising like a phoenix fromits ashes his castles were repairing his property wasrestored the list of his retainers daily became more numerous he revived and carefully recruited the martialband which in the first exacerbations of his despair hehad dismissed from his service my purse and all that ihad were his he never made a demand upon me that idid not instantly supply i reaped a particular pleasurefrom the largeness and frequency of his requisitions therewas nothing for which i was more anxious than to bindhim to me in indissoluble ties of gratitude and affectionlittle alas did i understand the compound of tendernessand ferocity of decisiveness and inscrutability withwhich i was now concerned my friend such i esteemedhim had been absent some time i expected his returnto my residence at buda and anxious to pay him everymark of attention and respect i set out to meet him itwas scarcely safe during the existing hostilities betweenthe austrians and the turks to travel any where withouta guard i had the precaution in the present instance totake with me an attendance of twenty mentravels of st leonit was after having partaken of a slight and early dinnerthat i set out on my excursion the season was remarkablyfine and the air genial and balsamic i scarcely evercommenced any tour with more agreeable sensations theharvest was already ripe and as i passed along i sawreapers from time to time entering upon the first essay oftheir interesting occupation i felt that i had at lengthsurmounted one of those difficulties with which i had beenso strongly assailed and to which i had refused to yieldif i were not free from apprehensions from the arbitrarynature of the government under which i lived i believedhowever that i had nothing further to dread from themisconstruction and animosity of the nation i preservedmy anxiety as to whether i should be able to substantiatethe benefit i had sought to confer was at an end and ihad little doubt that with the plenteous crops which wereon the point of being gathered my popularity would returnand the gratitude of my clients become more ardentthan ever it was a delicious enjoyment that i now experienced the pleasures that the eye unavoidably takes infrom the spectacle of a luxuriant autumn became blendedin my mind with the ideas of famine put to flight my ownrectitude vindicated and the benevolent purposes realisedthe prosecution of which had cost me so profound a heartachewe at length passed the lines of the soldiers planted forthe defence of the soil against the depredations of theenemy i had calculated that i should meet my guest afew leagues from buda i was deceived in my estimatethe day however of his arrival was fixed i could not bemistaken in his route i resolved not to turn back withoutmeeting him the road i took led upon the borders ofthat part of hungary which owned the austrian yoke the shades of night were fast gathering round us and weheard at a distance the alarmguns and the drums of theenemy i was not however a novice in the appearances ofa country the seat of military excursions and war and ifmy mind were not wholly free from perturbation anduncertainty i at least resolved not to be turned aside frommy purpose we travelled two hours longer still nod d travels of st leoxnotice of the approach of bethlem gabor at length aquestion was started whether we were still in the rightroad and i thought it advisable to hold a sort of councilof war to deliberate respecting our further proceedingshaving assembled my attendants for that purpose i wasnow first struck with the apprehensions and timidity whichthey unanimously betrayed they had been drawn outrather for show and to keep accidental stragglers in awethan with the expectation of actual service i became sensiblethat nothing was to be hoped from their resistance inthe event of an action and the utmost i could aim at wasin the mean time to hold them together by the sentimentof a common dangerit was resolved to return i began to be apprehensivethat bethlem gabor had been prevented by some unexpectedoccurrence from observing his appointment scarcely hadwe faced about before we heard a body of cavalry approachingus i called to my party to halt i soon discernedfrom symptoms not difficult to be remarked by acareful observer that the party at hand was composed ofaustrohungarians we had every thing to fear fromthem i held myself bound under these circumstances firstto make experiment of the fleetness of our horses ihowever charged my people to keep together and not tosuffer the enemy by means of our inadvertence and follyto make an easy prize of us one after another in a shorttime i found that our pursuers sensibly gained ground uponus i was mounted upon an excellent beast and couldeasily have rode away from my troop while they wouldhave been placed as a sort of intercepting object betweenme and the enemy but i had too much of a militaryspirit not instantly to reject so inglorious an expedient icalled a second time to my attendants to halt i judgedthat the party of our antagonists was less numerous thanours i was convinced that our common safety dependedupon our concerted resistance filled with the gallantrythat my situation inspired i did not perceive till it was toolate that my present call to halt was attended to by few even those few rather hung back divided between apprehensionand shame i was the foremost and before i wastravels op st leon aware i found myself through the means of the darknessenveloped by the enemy from my appearance theyjudged that i was the master and the rest my attendants they contented themselves therefore with the prize they hadmade and did not give themselves the trouble to pursuethe fugitives they eagerly enquired of me who i was and comparing my answers with various circumstanceswhich rumour had brought to their ear they easily concludedthat i was the rich stranger of buda the characterthey had heard of me did not produce in these freebootersany sentiments of forbearance or demonstrations of respectthe only point about which persons of their habits wereconcerned was how they should make the greatest advantageof what the fortune of war had thrown in theirwaywhile they were consulting and various expedients werestarted by one and another for this purpose a second alarmwas given and one of the party being despatched to reconnoitrepresently returned with intelligence that the personsapproaching were horsemen of the enemy and that theyamounted as he guessed to forty in number upon thisinformation the party whose prisoner i was agreed to returnwith all expedition by the way they had come andcommanded me upon pain of death to proceed in theircompany this menace had not the effect to deprive me ofcourage or presence of mind and i easily conceived thatthe readiest way to deliver myself from my embarrassmentwould be to join at the first opportunity the band of turcohungarianswhose approach had occasioned our suddenretreat the darkness of the night was favourable to mypurpose and taking advantage of a sudden winding inthe road i slackened all at once the pace of my horse withoutbeing observed by my companions who as the enemyapproached had now their thoughts almost wholly intentupon the safety of their retreat they passed me and ino sooner perceived that to be the case than covered fromtheir observation by the intervening inclosure i turned myhorse and gradually as my distance from my keepers increasedurged him to a fuller speed it was not longbefore i came up with the band which had produced ourd d travels of st leonalarm and hailing them with the acclamation long livethe mighty sultan was without difficulty admitted intotheir troop i instantly understood to my great joy thatthis was the party of bethlem gabor that i had come outto meethe received me with much cordiality and seemed greatlyrejoiced that fortune had made him the instrument of myrescue he proposed however that having met on theroad i should now instead of proceeding to buda returnwith him to his northern castle from which our distancewas scarcely greater than from the metropolis the proposalwas such as i had not expected nor could i wellcomprehend the purpose with which it was made but thehabitual demeanour of bethlem gabor neither accordedwith his minutely assigning a reason for what he did norwas calculated to encourage enquiry in another i saw nomaterial objection and therefore felt little scruple in yieldingto his desires our brief consultation on this pointpassed at some little distance from the rest of the troopwhen the morning broke the first thing that excitedmy attention was the appearance of his followers theywere full forty in number well mounted of a large andathletic figure with sunburnt faces immense whiskers anda ferocious countenance i thought i had never seen sotremendous a band to me they were every one of themstrangers of all the persons that surrounded me the onlyone of whom i had the slightest knowledge was bethlemgabor himself i know not why it was but i no soonerbeheld my situation than i was struck with alarm i sawmyself completely in the power of a man who three monthsbefore was ignorant even of my existence i had not asingle attendant of my own not an individual with me overwhom i had personal authority or command i had noreason to distrust my host towards me his demeanour hadever been frank confidential and manly i had everyimaginable claim upon his generosity and his gratitudebut our senses are often the masters of our mind and reasonvainly opposes itself to the liveliness of their impressionsevery time that i lifted my eyes and saw myselfhemmed in by these barbarians my heart seemed involuntravels op st leontartly to fail me bethlem gabor too appeared to neglectme he had never shown himself so little obliging and attentiveas at this moment and aided by the rest of thescene i thought i had never beheld him so deformed or sotremendous i was more than half inclined to wish myselfagain a prisoner with the austrian swhen we arrived at the castle we were all of us fatiguedand hungry we had roamed during the whole night arepast was prepared we sat down to partake of it excuseme said bethlem gabor in a low voice as he passedme that i this night offer you the fare of a soldier tomorrowyou shall be accommodated in a different mannerthe words were innocent the proceeding natural butthere was a mysterious gloom at least as i thought in thetone in which he spoke that electrified me the hall inwhich we supped was spacious and lofty the naked wallsand rafters were imbrowned with age though it wasdaybreak as we entered the windows were still darkenedand the apartment was illuminated only by the partialglare of lamps depending from the roof as i sat at tablewith the troop of my host i appeared to myself as if inclosedin a cavern of banditti though excellent partisansskilful in execution and perfect in their discipline they wereunpolished in their manners and brutal in their conversationi had been inured from infancy to all the refinementthat the age in which i lived had any where to boast andamidst the various evils i had suffered that of being associatedwith the vulgar and the base had never presenteditself while they uttered now a loathsome jest and nowa sanguinary ejaculation i became ashamed of my speciesand the pride of manhood perished within me they howeverpaid little attention either to my feelings or my personand accustomed as i had been whether with friends orenemies to be regarded as of some importance i foundmyself unaccountably and suddenly dwindled into a cipheri felt it like a release from the state of a galleyslave whenbethlem gabor proposed that we should break up our meetingand retire to restd d travels of st leonchapter xla succession of gloomy thoughts revolved in my mind forsome time after i was left to myself i was however overcomewith fatigue and after an interval of harassingmeditations insensibly fell asleep i was awakened aftersome hours repose by the presence of bethlem gaborstanding by the side of my couch he invited me to riseand when i had attired myself started the plan of ourvisiting together the various apartments of the castle asmall part of which only had been seen by me when i waslast at this place among other things he told me therewas a subterranean of most wonderful extent interspersedwith a variety of cells and lurking places of which no manhad to his knowledge ever ascertained the numberthe same dreary complexion of thought followed metoday which had been first produced in me upon my receptioninto the troop of bethlem gabor the precedingnight my sensations were of the most depressing anddiscomfiting nature i felt as if i were the slave of somedark mysterious tyrant and dragged along supinely whereverhe motioned me to go i tasked myself seriously i reasonedwith myself i felt that it was no idle and everydaypart that i was called to sustain and i resolved thati would not be ruined by my own inactivity and cowardiceyet when i examined the question dispassionately i couldnot find that i had any occasion for courage and i confessedthat it was not less censurable to discover a uselessspirit of mistrust and defiance than to desert one's preservationwhere resistance was demanded what reasonhad i to suspect a man between whom and myself therehad prevailed so much mutual confidence none nonei replied but the causeless and superstitious misgivings ofmy own mind even if had ground to distrust himwhat remedy had i against his ill faith placed as i was inthe midst of his own domains and surrounded by men devotedto his service to discover apprehension under suchcircumstances was to excite animosity these reasoningstravels of st leon particularly occurred to my mind as i stood waiting forthe torch which he had himself gone to procure that hemight attend me to the subterranean caverns i had asyet seen no one since we broke up from our nightly repastbut my host we will breakfast said he when wereturn from viewing these curiositieswe crept along a succession of dark and gloomy vaultsalmost in silence bethlem gabor though he led me onand discharged the office of a guide seemed to have smallinclination to assume that of an interpreter this wassufficiently in unison with his ordinary character to havelittle claim to excite surprise yet the reader will not onreflection greatly wonder that my present situation was farfrom agreeable i was alone in passages which to judgefrom any discoverable token you would scarcely imaginehad for ages been trod by a human creature the voicewas lost amidst the damps of these immense caverns norwas it possible by any exertion to call the hand of man toyour aid my guide was an individual whom calamityhad prompted to quarrel with the world of strong feelingsindeed of capacious thought but rugged ferocious brutaland inaccessible to prayer i had chosen him for my protectorand ally i had never intended to put myself in hispower there was a mystery in his carriage a somethingnot to be explained a shell that no human forces couldpenetrate that was mortal to confidence and might quailthe stoutesti thought there would be no end to our pilgrimage atlength we came to a strong door crossbarred and securedwith a frame of iron bethlem gabor unlocked it wehad no sooner entered that it impetuously closed behindus what is that said i startled at the loudness ofthe report come on cried my host it is only thewind whistling through the caverns the springbolt isshot but i have the key in my hand at the oppositeend of the apartment was another door with an ascent offive steps leading to it bethlem gabor unlocked thatalso and then faced about with the torch in his hand iwas close behind him stay where you are said hewith a furious accent and thrust me violently from him travels of st leonthe violence was unexpected i staggered from the top ofthe steps to the bottom this door closed with as loud areport as the other bethlem gabor disappeared i wasleft in darknessfor an instant i doubted whether the situation in whichi thus found myself were the result of design or of accidentthe shutting of the door might be ascribed to the latter the action however and the words of my host did not admitof that interpretation i stood motionless astonishedand almost incapable of reflection what an incrediblereverse was thus the creature of a moment yesterday ipossessed unbounded treasures and the hearts of the wholeturco hungarian nation yesterday as i rode forth onthis fatal excursion i beheld the food of a mighty peoplemature for consumption the growth of my exertions andit will not be thought surprising that my heart leaped withinme at the sight who would not have envied the unparalleledeminence at which i had arrived my triumphswere attended with no melancholy exceptions to damp theirjoy they were the children of no intrigue they weremanly frank ingenuous and honourable my laurels werestained with no drop of blood were tarnished with no tearsof the widow and the orphan how much more noble torescue mankind from famine and death than to violate thehonest pride of their nature with the exhibition of victoriesand trophies yet truly considered there was nothing abrupt in thereverse under which i was now suffering the whole wasa chain every link of which was indissolubly connected fromone end to the other my attempt to rescue a people fromthe horrors of famine necessarily exposed me to unfavourableaccidents and misconstruction it inevitably led tomy application to the government for its aid it could notfail to excite the alarms and jealousies of government as tothe tendency of my proceedings by exhibiting me as thepossessor of immense wealth with very limited means forthe protection of that wealth it marked me a prey to a rapaciousviceroy or his more despotic master when i becamesensible of the precarious situation in which i stood towardsthe powers of the state could i have fallen upon a moretravels of st leon natural expedient than the endeavour to cover myself withthe shield of friendship and gratitude in the person of oneof its nobles but this expedient would almost infalliblylead to the placing myself sooner or later in the power ofthe man whose friendship i sought i had done so andthis was the termination of my views and my projects i now well understood the purpose of that inattentionand neglect with which bethlem gabor had treated me thepreceding evening the uneasiness resulting from which ihad blamed in myself at the time as the dictate of weaknessand unworthy suspicion yesterday i had been placedunder the safeguard of a nation every man in buda andits environs was familiar with my person every man wouldhave been ready almost to sacrifice his life to procure mysafety now i was far from the scene of my philanthropicalexertions no one in the troop of bethlem gabor knew whoi was he had appeared to treat me the preceding eveningwith indifference and contempt if they saw me no moreno curiosity would by that circumstance be excited in theirminds my clients on the other hand in the vicinity of themetropolis however great an interest they might take inmy fortune had no clue that could lead them to the knowledgeof it they must suppose me a prisoner with theaustrians or that i had been killed in resisting to becometheir prisoner i was cut off from all assistance and discoveryand left as much in the power of my treacherousally as if i had been alone with him oppressed with theutmost disparity of personal force in the remotest island ofthe pacific oceansuch were the reflections that early suggested themselvesto my mind in the solitude and darkness in which i was thusunexpectedly involved meanwhile one tedious hour succeededto another and i remained unintended on and unnoticedi could form no conjecture as to the object ofbethlem gabor in the atrocious perfidy he had committedcould he have any resentment against me and did hemeditate revenge he had received from me nothing butbenefits did he employ restraint on my person as themeans of extortion i could not conceive that he couldhave any clue leading him to the discovery of my grand travels of st leonsecret and short of this my bounties had been so exuberantas i imagined left him nothing to wish in this wildernessof conjecture i however fixed upon extortion as amotive less incredible than revenge i impatiently waitedtill the appearance of my tyrant should free me from somepart of my present uncertaintyhe did not appear in the mean time i was in a conditionfeeble and exhausted the exercise of yesterday thehourlybaffled expectation of meeting him whom i hadcalled my friend the alternation of being first taken prisonerand afterwards rescued had extremely fatigued mewe had travelled during the whole night yet the unaccountabledejection of mind under which i laboured on ourarrival at bethlem gabor's castle had prevented me fromtaking almost any share in the coarse repast that had thenbeen set before us the entrance of my host in the morninghad rendered my slumbers short as i followed him to mydungeon unconscious whither i went my limbs ached andmy heart ached still more i was ill prepared for a fastof thirtysix hours which the brutality of my jailor inflictedupon me after having long expected him in vain i gavemyself up to despair what a termination of life for himwho possessed the philosopher's stone i cannot do justice to the sensations that now took possessionof my mind it was not the deadly calm of despairfor i still expected every moment when bethlem gaborwould appear i believed than he would and i believedthat he would not leave me to perish i listened with eagerattention to every sound and my soul floated on the howlingwinds in vain nothing came of it there was noalteration in the sound or only those vicissitudes to whichthe howling of the wind is unavoidably subject i thenturned away in anguish i cursed i stamped with myfeet i smote my forehead with my closed hand i toremy hair anon another sound arrested my attention itwas a different howling it seemed to be like a humanvoice my fancy created to me the tread of a human footi listened with more intentness of soul than ever it wasagain in vain no no he will not come he will never come whytravels of st leon should i agitate myself to no purpose let me lie downand die i reasoned with myself why should i wishto live i am nothing to any human being i am alone inthe boundless universe i have no tie to existence stleon has no wife st leon has no child he has neitherconnection nor friend in the world even in this wretchedvision of the philosopher's stone have i not tried it enough have i any hopes from it is it not time that i shouldthrow away that and existence together my meditationswere ineffectual i suppose it is the case with all men thusviolently thrust out of life in the full possession of theirfaculties i know it was the case with me the moreperemptory was my summoner the more obstinately i clungto the worthless toyat length i laid myself down on the floor and if i occasionallylistened i no longer ran to the walls and thedoors to catch the uncertain sounds the gnawing i nowfelt within were intolerable they were at one period sosevere that can compare them to nothing but the sensationof having swallowed a glowing ember afterwardsthe weakness of nature would no longer feed this excruciatingpain and it subsided into a starting and convulsivethrob the pain was diversified with intervals of a deathlikeand insupportable sickness but no i will not attemptto describe the horrors of hunger sublimed by despair wherethe torture of the mind gives new pungency and uproar tothe corporeal anguish the image as it now presents itselfto my recollection is too dreadfulat last i sunk into a state of insensibility and the agonyi had suffered seemed drawn to its final close the busyturmoil the feverish dream of human existence was at anend i shut my eyes and i believed i should open themno morechapter xlihow long i endured this suspension of the vital faculties icannot tell the next impression on my sensorium subsequentto those i have described was a sort of external travels of st leontwitching and violence that seemed to persecute me it wasan importunity from which i felt desirous to escape ilonged to be undisturbed and at rest the intruder on myquiet would not leave me and i at length roused myselfas if to put away my cause of molestation my thoughtswere all confounded and obscure i knew not where icould scarcely be said to know who i was a little moreeffort brought with it a further capacity of perception isaw before me what was now the chief object of my mortalaversion the figure of bethlem gabor it was some timelonger before i became aware that he had been employedin taking up my apparently lifeless corpse placing it on astonebench in the side of the cave and chaining it to thewall he observed the motions that indicated in me returninglife he remarked the stare of my glassy and raylesseyes he now spoke with a stern and unpitying voicethere is food there is a light eat having thus said heleft mewhat a cruel and remorseless treatment he cared notfor my life he disdained to make the slightest exertion torestore me he left it to chance whether i should revive orperish the figure of a dying man that i presented didnot make one fibre of his bosom bend or quiveri revived i ate by degrees i recovered from thedeadly languor which had invaded my senses in about twelvehours longer bethlem gabor returned with a new supply ofsustenance i was now strong enough to be able to conversewith him i heard the heavy sound of opening locks andremoving bolts before he entered and i summoned myfaculties to expostulate with himwhy am i here what is the meaning of the unworthyway in which you treat me it is he regarded me with a truculent aspect as ifhe would pierce through my heart because i hate you you hate me good god is it possible what evilhave i done to you what good have i not done you what supplies have i refused you what occasions havei neglected of studying your advantage your interest andyour honour if thus your hatred is purchased how shallthat man demean himself who is to purchase your love travels of st leonoh think not my hatred idle or capricious heavenknows i would have refrained from hating you if i hadbeen able i struggled against it with all the energies ofmy soul but you have committed towards me the mostmortal offences that man ever endured there is an antipathybetween your nature and mine that all the menstruumsin the world could never bring to coalesceeternal providence and what is the source of thisantipathy and do you profess ignorance have you not goneon day after day with the full consciousness and will totorment me have i not warned you and expostulatedwith you times without number of what have you warned me i hate mankind i was not born to hate them i haveno native obliquity of character i have no diabolical maliciousnessof constitution but they have forced me tohate them and the debt of abhorrence shall be amply paidi loved as never mortal loved no human heart wasever so devoted and centred and enveloped in the kindlyaffections of family and parentage as mine has been wasnot my wife were not my children murdered when icame home to feast my eyes and tranquillise my soul withthe sight of them did i not find all waste and desolation did i not find their bodies naked pale disfigured withwounds plunged in blood and already putrid this wasthe welcome i looked for this was the object i sospeeded to see no never was a moment like that mywhole nature was changed in an instant my eyes wereblasted and dried to horn my blood froze in my wellstored veins i have no longer delight but in humanmiserymy revenge is not causeless this was not the act ofindividuals all men in the place of these murdererswould have done as they did they are in a league togetherhuman pity and forbearance never had a harbourbut in my breast and i have now abjured them withsomething more of inwrought vigour and energy i willbecome like to my brethren

glow of resentment i hated you the more becausehaving suffered what i had suffered your feelingsand conduct on the occasion have been the reverse ofmine your character i thank god is of all beings themost opposite to that of bethlem gaborat length you filled up the measure of the variousthwarting with which you daily insulted me there wastravels of st leon one native of hungary between whom and

have no need torecur to expostulation expostulation never moved theheart of bethlem gabor hereafter you shall hear more thus speaking he left me and i must confess withwhatever disgrace to my sagacity he opened upon me anew world i conceived not till now the faintest suspicionof what had been labouring in his bosom amidstah my experience of the varieties of human character thiswas a species that had never fallen under my observationbefore what a painful and mortifying occurrence is itin human life when we have lived with a man from day todaywhen we have conversed with him familiarly and seenhim in all the changes of circumstance and when weflatter ourselves we have penetrated all the recesses of hisheart suddenly to start upon something portentous thatbrooded there of which to that moment we had not thelightest suspicion i am not the only individual to whomthis event has occurredin a subsequent visit of bethlem gabor to my cell forhe only attended me with provisions he would intrust thesecret of my confinement to no other mortal i intreatedhim to inform me with what intention he retained me aprisoner and to fix a price on my ransom to this overturehe appeared to yield some degree of attention hemade no explicit answer but asked with an inquisitive andjs b travels op st leonsevere tone in what manner i imagined i could procuremoney in my dungeon let us agree upon the terms and set me at large youhave never found me deceitful and you shall not find medeceitful nowf do not hope i will consent to that i ask you againin what manner do you imagine you can procure money inyour dungeon i reflected for a moment liberty is ineffably sweet and whatever followed upon the present overture i wasdetermined not to neglect the faintest prospect that led to atermination of my confinementthere is answered i in my mansion at buda achest which if it can be brought to me hither will enableme to supply your demands i have the key in my custodyand no key but my own will unlock the treasuregive me the key replied bethlem gaborno rejoined i it is in my custody it is not uponmy person i have taken care of that no human handshall touch it but my ownand how can i cause this chest to be brought to youwithout risking a discovery of your situation or that i hada concern in your disappearance of that said i judge for yourself i have madea proposition to you and i have done enough i will haveno share in the detail qf its executionwell said bethlem gabor after having ruminateda moment the chest you shall have i undertake thatdescribe iti described the chest and its situation in my housewith a minuteness that made mistake impossibleafter a considerable time it was brought to me it was toobulky and ponderous to be introduced into my cell by a singlearm but bethlem gabor having first caused me unconsciouslyto swallow a powerful opiate found no difficultyeither to conceal my person in the dark shadows this raggedsubterranean or to cause some of his followers to placethe chest within my reach believing that they placed it inavacant apartment i awoke and found it at hand i wassecure that the lock was such a one as could not be forced travels of st leonbut i examined the different surfaces to see whether violenceof any other sort had been exercised on it there weremarks of damage but not sufficiently unequivocal to enableme to form a certain judgment on this point the chestcontained not gold but the implements for making andfashioning gold allowing for the distance from which itwas brought they appeared to be pretty exactly in the statein which i left them i had never placed much confidencein this expedient for softening the heart of bethlem gabor but i perceived that it would serve at worst to divert mythoughts and by exciting in me some share of expectationmight call off my attention from the miseries of my presentcondition embracing the occasions when i was mostsecure against the intrusion of my jailor i provided myselfwith the sum that had been previously agreed on betweenus my task being finished i carefully displayed the produceof my labour against the next time bethlem gaborshould visit my cell he viewed it with an air of sullenand gloomy triumph he removed it from the cave whichwas my habitation to an apartment of this subterraneousabode little distant from my own when he had concludedthis employment it seemed to be a just inferencethat he was to give me my liberty he did no such thingwithout uttering a word he closed the door of my cavernlocked it and departedwhen bethlem gabor next entered my cell i reproachedhim with this as with the breach of a solemn engagementhis first answer was an infernal laugh expressive ofderision hardheartiness and contempt by and byhowever he condescended to explain himself more fullyi made no engagement cried he you talked of aransom and i suffered you to talk i made you no answer i gave you no encouragement boy i deceived you not no though my heart pants for vengeance and

teach youto implore my bounty for the most miserable pittancelook to it you know your destiny do not provoke myfury without a foresight of the consequences i will enter into little further detail of this my wretchedimprisonment in the wilds of hungary it was not destituteof its varieties and i could if i pleased fill a volumewith the artifices and the violence of my gloomy superintendenti could fill volumes with the detail of the multipliedexpedients the furious menaces the gigantic startsand rhapsodies of passion by which he alternately urgedme to compliance and concession but i will not i willbring to an end the history of bethlem gabor and thenhaving detailed the surprising events that immediately followedit will close the page of st leon's history for everi stood like a rock shut out from all other gratifications iat least resolved to accumulate in my own person all the energiesof resistance if i were to unfold the story i couldcommand the reader's astonishment his admiration but theobject of these papers is to record not my merits but my fatehow different was my imprisonment in the cavern of themanabhorring palatine from that which i had experiencedin the dungeons of the inquisition there an inexorableapathy prevailed my tyrants were indifferent whether idied or lived filled with the sense of their religious elevationthey held on the even gravity of their course andcounted my groans and my tears neither for remorse norpleasure the variety i experienced in their dungeons wasthe growth of my own thoughts from without i encounteredno interruption it was not to be ascribed to thosewho held me in durance if my faculties were not lethargicinto death bethlem gabor possessed no share of their apathy his malice was ever alive his hatred ever ingeniousand new in its devices he had a purpose to answer toextort from me the supply of his necessities and projects itwas not so much perhaps that he stood in need of this asthat he placed a pride in it and had fiercely resolved to showtravels of st leon me that i was unreservedly his slave his animosity againstme was so fixed and insatiable that nothing that was painto me was indifferent to him if at any time he saw mesubsiding into insensibility he failed not to exert himself tosting me into life againthe consequence of this was somewhat different fromwhat bethlem gabor expected desponding as i wasweary of life and almost finally alienated from the allottedgift of the philosopher's stone if he had left me tomyself i should very probably have sought in insensibilityrelief from the torment of my own thoughts but hetaught me a better lesson refusing me the indulgence oftorpor he obliged me to string myself to resistance hegave me a passion he gave me an object he gave me comparativehappiness i was roused to opposition i wasresolved that placed as i seemed to be at his mercy iwould yield him no atom of his desires thus employedi found in my employment pride perpetual occasion presenteditself for fortitude and i gradually ascended to thesweets of consistency perseverance and selfgratulation ihad for years been inured to satisfy myself with a sparingstock of pleasures and i was less at a loss to expand andramify those which i now possessed than almost any otherman would have been in my situation if my attendanttrain of sensations was scanty bethlem gabor took care toafford them a perpetual supply of food and employmentand i was comparatively little exposed to the pain ofvacuity when he saw that i was inflexible and that hecould no longer gain from me the smallest compliance withhis will he raged against me with terrifying fury was itacrime in me that this fury in my tyrant produced theoperation of a sedative and a cordial there was no malignityin the joy it gave me i had much aversion forbethlem gabor but no hatred i took no pleasure in hisagonies because they were agonies my sympathies towardshim now i confess were small but the joy i felt wasbecause his fury told me was the unwilling evidence of myown value i left him to assail the mound i opposed to hisdesires as he pleased it remained strong and unaffectedas the seabeaten promontory from the inefficacy of hise e travels of st leonefforts i sometimes took occasion to remonstrate with myjailor and demand the restoration of my liberty butbethlem gabor was not a man whom arguments and expostulationslike these could move in spite of himselfhowever i commanded his wonder if not his esteem heregarded the contrast as almost incredible between theboyaspect under which he saw me and the inflexibilityand resources of my timeinstructed mindthe contentment that i have here described in myselfwas however a creature of the imagination the forced progenyof uncommon effort it was no natural state of thesoul my mind would sometimes wander beyond thelimits of my cavern and remember that there were otherpersons beside bethlem gabor and myself in the worldi recollected the situation in which i had left my greatproject for the reviviscence of hungary and rejoiced toremember that it was already in such forwardness as ihoped no longer to stand in absolute need of my assistanceyet what i had done was but a small portion a dismemberedbranch of what i had meditated to do and whatevery person of a generous and enterprising mind whohad been in possession of the philosopher's stone wouldhave designed why was i thus stopped in the commencementof a career so auspiciously begun and to whichan ardent fancy would prescribe no limits why wasevery power of the social constitution every caprice of themultitude every insidious project of the noble thus instantlyin arms against so liberal and grand an undertaking nor could i help repining at the perverseness oftiny fate which had decreed that i should savour all thebitterness incidentally resulting from my plan and not bepermitted so much as to taste the applause and reward thatought to grow out of its completion thousands of menwere at this instant indebted to my generosity and exertionsfor every blessing they enjoyed and i was cast forthas the refuse of the earth pining under the alternate successionof solitude negligence and malice my very existenceand the manner of it unknown except to oneindividual who had from the strangest and most unexpectedmotives sworn eternal hostility to metravels of st leon bethlem gabor had resolved that so long as he lived ishould remain a prisoner when he died if he continuedmy only jailor the single individual acquainted with theplace of my confinement the probable issue was that ishould perish with hunger twelve years before i shouldhave contemplated this attitude and condition of existencewith indescribable horror but within that time i hadbeen better taught i had received an education i thankthem in the dungeons of the spanish inquisition and ifthat be properly considered it will not be wondered at thati was superior to ordinary terrors early in my presentsituation the presentiment had suggested itself to me thatby some striking event i should be rescued from mypresent confinement and improbable as the suggestionwas it made an indelible impression on my mind i had originatedin or it had produced a dream the scenes of whichhad appeared particularly luminous and vivid i imaginedi saw a knight cased complete in proof enter my prisona smile of angelic kindness beamed on his countenancehe embraced me with ardour he made a sign to me tofollow him i felt that i had seen him somewhere thathe had been my intimate friend yet all the efforts i madein sleep or afterwards when i was awake were unavailingto remove the mystery that hung upon his features irose to obey him the ground trembled under my feet likean earthquake presently with the incoherency usuallyattendant on a dream the figure changed to that of a femaleof unblemished grace and beauty it unfolded a pair ofradiant wings we ascended together in the air i lookeddown and saw the castle of bethlem gabor a prey to devouringflames here ended my dream i soon felt thati could reason myself out of all confidence in the presagesof this wild and incongruous vision but i refused to doitmy consolations were not so plenteous in this frightfulsolitude as that i should willingly part with one so deliciousreason thus applied i contemplated as an abhorredintruder it was for a long time part of myoccupation in every day to ruminate on this vision notwith the sternness of a syllogist bat with the colouring ofa painter and the rapture of a bard from thus obsti travels op st

noontide splendour chapter xliii had now continued here for several months and in allthat time had received no external impressions but such asrelated to the cell i inhabited and the misanthropical savageby whom it was visited one evening that bethlem gaborentered my dungeon i observed in him an air of unusualdisturbance where apathy reigns the intercourse betweenthose over whom it presides will be marked with a deathlikeuniformity but wherever the furious passions taketheir turn they will occasionally subside into a semblanceof familiarity and benevolence there was something inthe countenance of my tyrant that made me for a momentforget the complicated injuries i had received from himwhat is it that has disturbed you cried i there wasno answer there was a knitting in his brow and a contractionin his features that showed me his silence was aneffort he departed however and had already passed thethreshold of my dungeon the door was in his hand hereturned chatillon said he

of twentyfourhoursto these terms i assented without hesitation the chainsfell from my wrists and my ancles i stood up once moreunshackled and in respect of my limbs a free man whenbethlem gabor was on the point to depart my soul meltedwithin me i took hold of his hand my fingers trembledi grasped and pressed the fingers of my tyrant i cannotdescribe what then passed in my bosom no man canunderstand my sensations who had not been in my situationwho had not passed through a treatment arbitraryferocious and inhuman and had not then seen the beingwho had wounded him so unpardonably suddenly changinghis character commiserating his fate and rescuing himfrom destructionfrom this time i saw bethlem gabor no more he diedas he had sworn to do in the last dike of his fortresshis selfbalanced and mighty soul could not submit to thecondition of a prisoner he was nothing if he were notfree as the air and wild as the winds i may be mistaken but this appears to me to have been a great andadmirable man he had within him all the ingredients ofsublimity and surely the ingredients of sublimity are thematerials of heroic virtue i have much cause of com travels op st leon plaint against him he conceived towards me an animositythe most barbarous and unprovoked but in writing thisnarrative i have placed my pride in controlling the suggestionsof resentment and i have endeavoured to do himjusticei had engaged to wait twentyfour hours i waited onlysix i know not how the reader will decide upon the moralityof my conduct but i own i had not the force i believei may call it the insensibility to remain in my dungeonany longer there was no doubt that if bethlem gaborreturned a conqueror the term of my imprisonment wouldbe renewed and all his former menaces continued in forcewhat should i deserve to have thought of me if i couldsit down idly and tamely wait the return of my jailorno liberty is one of the rights that i put on when i puton the form of a man and no event is of power to dissolveor abdicate that right of what validity was the promisethat bethlem gabor extorted from me by compulsion andas the condition of that which he had no title to withhold what gratitude did i owe to this man who treated me withevery contumely and shrunk from nothing bul the thoughtof causing me to perish with hunger whatever becameof my attempt to escape i could at least in this vast subterraneanhide myself from the face of him who had injuredme i had a provision of phosphorus in my chest and could therefore extinguish my torch upon the slightestalarm and relume it at pleasure what was the value oflife situated as i was situated it was better to perish inthe attempt to escape than linger on for ever in perpetualimprisonment as a further resource i left a billet in mydungeon for for this also i had implements intreatingbethlem gabor by every motive of compassion and humanityto provide for me the means of sustenance as usualhaving taken these precautions i lighted a fresh torch and unlocking the door and thrusting the key into mygirdle set out upon my expedition though bethlemgabor had stipulated for twentyfour hours the siege mighteven now be over and i trembled every instant lest myjailor should returni wandered for a considerable time among the alleys andtravels of st leon windings of this immeasurable cavern i had the precautionto mark the sides of the vault with characters andtokens as i passed that if necessary i might be able tofind the way back to my dungeon this might prove anindispensable resource to prevent me from perishing withhunger once or twice i changed my route inferringfrom a comparison of circumstances the best i could makethat i was not in the direction of the castle from whichbethlem gabor had led me to my imprisonment in allthis wandering i had seen nothing i had heard nothingwhich could demonstrate to me that i was approaching thehabitation of man i had groped my way for near twohours when on a sudden i heard a loud and tremendousshout that almost stunned me and that from its uncommonshock could be at no great distance from the placewhere i stood this was succeeded by a terrifying glareof light i extinguished my torch both that i might bebetter qualified to observe and that i might be less indanger of discovery by any one who should approach meunawares the shouts were several times repeated thelight i found to proceed from that end of the vault towardswhich i had been advancing and by the best conjectures icould form i concluded the outlet into the castle to be atno great distance i heard the crackling of the flamesand the fall of rafters and beams presently i discerned avolume of smoke approaching me and found that if i remainedlong in my present station i should incur the riskof being suffocated i formed my resolution i concludedthat bethlem gabor's castle was taken and set on fire bythe austrians i believed that my persecutor was alreadyno more to this faith i was undoubtedly prompted by thepresentiment which he had communicated to me i sawthat it would be impossible for me to emerge into light tillthe flames should abate i once more therefore lightedmy torch and returned by the straightest road i could findto my dungeon arrived there i proposed to pass theinterval quietly in the cavern where i had so long felt theweight of the hungarian's chains suddenly however thesuggestion occurred to me may not my conjectures befalse may not bethlem gabor yet repel the enemy and travels of st leonreturn to me from amidst the ruins of his falling castle the thought was sickness and extinction to my hearthope beautiful as are thy visions in how much anguishand agony do they clothe the terrors of disappointment never had bethlem gabor been half so dreadful to me asnow i shrunk away i took with me the fragmentsof provision that yet remained i hid myself i deemedno cell remote enough to conceal me from the inhumanpersecution of my tyranti continued in the subterranean all that day and all thesucceeding night once in this period i attempted to reconnoitrethe avenue of my escape but i found the situationstill so heated and suffocating that i did not venture toproceed at length i came forth from this den of horrorsand again beheld the light of the sun the path hadalready been sufficiently explored by me and i no longerfound any material obstacles i now saw that my conjectureswere true the castle of my ferocious adversary wasa pile of ruins the walls indeed for the most part remainedbut choked with fragments of the falling edificeblackened with the flames and penetrated in every directionby the light of day with difficulty i climbed overthe ruins which opposed my egress from the subterraneanand rendered my passage to the outside of the castle anaffair of peril and caution here the first object thatstruck me was some tents probably of the soldiers whohad been employed in this work of destruction i washailed by a sentinel and i demanded that he would conductme to his commander he led me to the centre ofthe little encampment and i stood in the presence of hischief i lifted my eye to behold him and was petrifiedwith such astonishment as till that hour i had never feltit was charles my son my only son the darling of hismother the idol of my soul chapter xliiiit may seem extraordinary that i should instantly haveknown him he was sitting at a table covered withtravels of st leon papers and with one or two aidesdecamp waiting to receivehis orders he was clothed in complete armourand his casque was resting on the ground by his sidewhen i entered his eye was fixed on a despatch that dayreceived from the great palatine of hungary but in littlemore than a minute he raised his head and his countenancewas completely presented to my view it wasfifteen years since i had beheld it he was then scarcelyabove half his present age a mere stripling in whom thefirst blush of manhood had awakened the sentiment of independenceand an honour impatient of a shade he wasnow a leader of warlike bands his complexion olivet overwith service and his eye rendered steady with observationand thought but i knew him j i knew him in a momentmy soul with the rapidity of lightning told me who hewas not all the arts in the world could have hid himfrom me not all the tales that delusion ever framed couldhave baffled me i could have challenged him against theearth i have already had occasion to explain the complexity ofmy feelings when after a long absence i visited theheiresses of the house of st leon the sweets of recognitionthat transporting effervescence of the mind wherethe heart bounds to meet a kindred heart where emotionsand tears mingle in speechless encounter where all isgazing love and strict embrace these pleasures weredenied me i stood stiff and motionless in the presence ofmy child my heart might burst but it must not and itcould not communicate its feelingsafter an instant's pause of overwhelming sensation isunk back on myself and considered my own figure ithappened that exactly opposite to me in the tent of my sonhung his armour and over the rest his polished shield inwhich i saw my own person clearly reflected the youthof my figure indeed was still visible but the hardships ofmy dungeon had imprinted themselves in glaring characterson my face my beard was neglected my hair was mattedand shaggy my complexion was of a strong and deadlyyellow my appearance to a considerable degree told mystory without the need of words charles enquired of travels of st leonthose who brought me where they had found this wretchedand unhappy figure and was told that i had been seen afew minutes before coming out from the ruins of bethlemgabor's castle he humanely and naturally concludedthat i was a victim on whom the tyrant had exercised hisferocity and that i had been shut up in some dungeon ofthe fortress it was impossible that any person above groundin the castle should have come out alive from the operationof the flames he commanded that i should be led to aneighbouring tent and taken care of after having beenrefreshed with food and rest and attired with other apparelhe directed that i should be brought to him againthat he might hear my storyunder these circumstances there was nothing for whichi was more anxious than that i might recruit myself andshake off as quickly as possible the effects of my confinementcordials were brought me and i tasted of them i bathed in a neighbouring stream one of my son's attendantsremoved my beard and arranged my hair i nowdesired to be left alone that i might take some needfulrepose i could not sleep but i reclined my limbs upona couch and began to collect my thoughtsi saw myself in one hour the sport of the most completereverse of fortune that could happen to a mortal i hadbeen the prisoner of a cavern so wild and pathless as almostto defy the utmost extent of human sagacity to exploreits recesses from this cavern but for the suddenand extraordinary event which had just occurred i couldnever have come forth alive all sober calculation wouldhave taught me to expect that i should have remainedthere chained up like a savage tiger in his cage as long asbethlem gabor existed and that when he died i shouldperish unheard unknown no creature that lived suspectingmy situation no lapse of ages ever bringing to light mydismal catastrophe the remorse and relenting of bethlemgabor towards me seemed so little to accord with any thingthat i had personally witnessed of his habits and his mindthat even now i feel myself totally unable to account for itas it was however i was once again free from the stateof an outlaw imprisoned for life i suddenly saw myself attravels of st leon large inspirited by the light of the sun and refreshed byhis genial rays in the full possession of youth and all itsfaculties enabled to return amidst my clients of buda orto seek some new adventure in any corner of the earth towhich my inclination led me there is no man howeveroverwhelmed with calamities however persecuted with endlessdisappointment however disgusted with life and all itsspecious allurements to whom so sudden and admirable achange would not convey some portion of elasticity andjoybut there was one thought that entirely occupied me icannot describe how my soul yearned towards this my onlyson the sentiment even now as i write is an oppressioni am scarcely able to sustain willingly most willinglywould i have traversed every region of the globe if so imight have discovered his unknown retreat and now suddenlywithout the smallest effort on my part he was placedbefore me his last solemn parting his abjuration of my societyand intercourse for ever rose to my memory and gavea zest inexpressible to our present encounter at the thoughtthat my son was in the neighbouring tent all earthly objectsbeside faded from my mind and appeared uninterestingand contemptible i instantly resolved to devote myselfto his service and to place all my enjoyment in thecontemplation of his happiness and the secret consciousnessof promoting it he had if i may so express myself inmy own person forbidden me his presence in my nowaltered figure i might disobey his injunction without fearinghis rebuke let not the reader condemn me that endowedas i was with unlimited powers of action i preferreda single individual my own son to all the worldbeside philanthropy is a godlike virtue and can never betoo loudly commended or too ardently enjoined but naturalaffection winds itself in so many folds about theheart and is the parent of so complicated so various andexquisite emotions that he who should attempt to divesthimself of it will find that he is divesting himself of allthat is most to be coveted in existence it is not a selfishpropensity en the contrary i will venture to affirm thatthe generosity it breathes is its greatest charm beside in travels op st leonmy case i considered my own existence as blasted and icould therefore find nothing better than to forget myself inmy son i had made a sufficient experiment of the philosopher'sstone and all my experiments had miscarried mylatest trials in attempting to be the benefactor of nationsand mankind not only had been themselves abortive butcontained in them shrewd indications that no similar plancould ever succeed i therefore discarded for the presentat least all ambitious and comprehensive views and believedthat i ought to be well content if i could prove theunknown benefactor of the son of marguerite de damvillei entered into a solemn engagement with myself that iwould forget and trample upon every personal concern andbe the victim and the sacrifice if need were of the happinessof my child dismissing my project of becoming afactor for the hungarian people i determined to lay asidethe name of chatillon and cut off every indication thatmight connect my present existence with that of the richstranger of buda one of the advantages i possessed forthat purpose was that no creature in hungary had theslightest suspicion that the sieur de chatillon had ever beenthe prisoner of bethlem gaborhaving thus arranged my thoughts i now called for thegarments that had been assigned me they were suppliedme from the stock of my son and when i had put themon i overheard the attendants whispering to each other theirastonishment at the striking resemblance between theirmaster and myself when i came once more into thetent of their captain and stood as in the former instancebefore his shield i did not wonder at their remarkthe coincidence of our features was so great that had wepassed through a strange place in each other's company ishould infallibly have been regarded as his younger brotheryet there was something of marguerite in the countenanceof charles that i wanted when i recovered as in a shorttime afterwards i did my vigour and health i was moreblooming than he but there was something graceful ingenuousand prepossessing in his aspect which i could by nomeans boast in an equal degree and which might havecarried him unhurt and honoured through the world wetravels of st leon shall see some of the effects of this in what i shall presentlyhave occasion to relatewhen my son required of me to declare who i was itold him as i had already determined to do that i was acadet of the house of aubigny in france that after havingpassed through several other countries i had come intopoland withthe floating and half formed purpose of enteringas a volunteer against the turk but that before myplan was completely arranged having been led by myjuvenile ardour in a hunting party far within the frontierof hungary i had been so unfortunate as to become aprisoner to the troopers of bethlem gabor i added thatwhen introduced to their chief i had given him so muchoffence by the firmness of my manner and my refusing tocomply with certain propositions he made me that he hadthrust me into a dungeon from which but for the gallantexertions of the present detachment i should never havecome out alivecharles heard my story with attention and interest hecalled on me to resume my courage and my hopes and tobe confident that my sufferings were now at an end hetold me that he was a frenchman as well as myself andlike myself had been a soldier of fortune he felt hesaid a powerful sympathy in my tale j there was somethingin my countenance that irresistibly won his kindness andif i would put myself under his protection he did notdoubt to be the means of my future success he spokewith great asperity of bethlem gabor who as anintrepid indefatigable and sanguinary partisan had beenthe author of greater mischiefs to the christian cause thanany of the immediate servants of the sultan of constantinoplehe congratulated himself that the same action thathad delivered the world from so murderous a renegado hadrendered him the preserver of a youth of so much enterpriseand worth as he doubted not i should prove hesaid there was but one other man in hungary whohad been so effectual an enemy to the cause of truthand christianity as bethlem gabor the name of thisman he understood was chatillon and he grieved to sayf f travels of st leonthat he bore the appellation of a frenchman to theeternal disgrace of the nation that gave him birth he hadjoined the turkish standard and by exertions difficult tobe comprehended had rescued the infidels from famine ata time when but for his inauspicious interference budaand perhaps every strong town in hungary were on thepoint of falling into the hands of the christians it wasthis same man who had revived the resources of bethlemgabor after they had once before by his own fortunateexertions been routed out and whom i might thereforein some sense consider as the author of my calamities aswell as the inveterate foe of christendom such a wretchas this was scarcely entitled to the common benefit of thelaws of war and he would not answer for himself if cotillonhad fallen into his power to what extremity his holyresentment against this degenerate fellowcountryman mighthave hurried him providence however had overtaken himin his impious career and he had fallen obscurely as hehad lived basely in a night skirmish with a party ofmarauders from the austrian camp the reader maybelieve that i did not a little rejoice that in announcingmyself a few moments before i had taken the name notof chatillon but d'aubigny what i heard howeveroccasioned in me a profound reflection on the capriciousnessof honour and fame and the strange contrarieties withwhich opposite prejudices cause the same action to beviewed i could not repress the vehemence of my emotionswhile i was thus calumniated and vilified for actionswhich i had firmly believed no malice could misrepresentand fondly supposed that all sects and ages as far as theirrecord extended would agree to admirein another point of view the invective which my sonthus unconsciously poured in my ears had the effect ofmaking me regard with a more complacent satisfaction theplan i had formed of devoting myself to his service herei pursued no delusive meteor of fame the very essence ofmy project lay in its obscurity kings and prelates armiesand churches would no longer find an interest in disputingabout my measures i should indulge the secret promptingsof my soul undisturbed alike by the censure of thetravels of st leon world and its applause it was thus that under everychange of fortune i continued to soothe my soul with delusivedreamsmeanwhile my project went on with the happiest auspicesthe friendship between me and charles continuedhourly to increase as a frenchman whom chance hadintroduced to his acquaintance in a distant country it wasnatural that he should feel a strong bias of affection towardsme but that sort of fraternal resemblance which the mostinattentive spectator remarked in us operated forcibly to theincrease of charles's attachment he would often in theingenuous opening of his soul towards me call me hisbrother and swear that i should for ever experience fromhim a brother's love charles had by this time completedthe thirtysecond year of his age i was in appearance atleast ten years younger than he there is something inthis degree of disparity that greatly contributes to the cultivationof kindness and is adapted to the engendering athousand interesting sentiments frequently would he exclaim our fortunes my dear henry that was the name iassumed have been in a considerable degree similar wewere both of us early cast on the world i indeed at theimmature age of seventeen i entered the world withoutan adviser or a friend but my destiny was favourable andi escaped its quicksands and its rocks i have now by aconcurrence of happy circumstances obtained a place amonghonourable men and soldiers and for what is to come mayreasonably regard myself with some degree of confidenceyou are yet in one of the most dangerous periods of humanlife your work is all to do your battles are yet to fightsuffer me my dear friend to represent your better geniusand act an elder brother's part you shall find me noignorant mentor and no ungentle onenothing could be more gratifying to me than to see theshoots of affection thus springing up spontaneously incharles's bosom i willingly humoured the generous deceptionthat he was putting on himself and heard withtransports inconceivable his assurances of kindness and protectionwe rode and we walked together we were in amanner inseparable when he went out to reconnoitre if f travels of st leonwas his chosen companion when he inspected the disciplineand condition of his soldiers he applied that opportunityto initiate me in the science of war when he expected toencounter the enemy he placed me immediately by his sidesometimes he would open his heart to me and dwellwith a melancholy delight upon his secret sorrows fc it isno wonder my henry he would say that i feel this uncommonattachment to you i am alone in the world ihave no father no mother and no brethren i am anexile from my country and cut off for ever from those ofmy own lineage and blood it is with inexpressible delightthat i thus cheat the malice of my fate and hold you tomy bosom as if you were indeed my brother i would notpart with the fiction for the mines of peru and i knownot whether i do not cultivate it more assiduously and regardit with a sentiment of more anxiety and zeal becauseit is a fiction than i should do if it were a reality i hadindeed added charles a mother and when he hadstarted this theme he would dwell for ever on her praisesi easily saw that never son loved a mother more cordiallythan charles loved the allaccomplished marguerite withwhat sentiments did i hear her eulogium i could not joinin her praises i could not be supposed to know her istood there as the statue of prometheus might have doneif after being informed with a living soul the gods hadseen fit to chain its limbs in everlasting marble the passionwithin me panted and laboured for a vent but i wasinvincibly silent with what sentiments did i hear hereulogium every word of it was a dagger to my heart every word said and thou villain wert not thou hermurderer more painfully than the fiercest reproachescould have donewhen charles had celebrated with an eloquence trulydivine this incomparable mother a sudden pang of memorywould make him start into rage and this mother ileft of this mother i cannot tell whether she is alive ordead what shall i say the crime or the not less fatalerror of my father separated me from this mother iloved my father i loved him because he was my father i had great obligations to him he once had virtues buttravels op st leonmy mother if i could have found her in the wildestdesert of africa and have known her virtues a strangerto my blood descended from the remotest tribe of the humanrace i should have chosen her for my friend mypreceptress and my guide beyond all that youth and beautywith their most radiant charms could tender to my acceptance thus unconsciously yet ingeniously did my dear sonfrom time to time torture his father's heart i could noteven deliver him from the gloomy and wretched uncertaintywhether this mother were alive or dead with oneword i could have composed his soul into a sober grief icould have said your adorable mother at length rests fromher sorrows she is no longer the victim of a misguidedand a cruel father you have no longer occasion to broodover that most disconsolate of reflections i know not whatanguish may be at this moment suffered by her who is entitledto all my duty and all my affection with oneword i might have told this and that word i dared notutterchapter xlivmy son related to me his history and made me the depositoryof his feelings and reflections the name of stleon indeed never passed his lips i felt that he had consignedthat to inviolable oblivion the appellation he borein the army was the chevalier de damville soon after heabandoned me at dresden he had entered as a volunteerin the imperial army charles the fifth was at that timeassembling forces to encounter the confederates of theleague of alcalde in this situation my son was eminentlyfortunate he was distinguished for uncommonenterprise and courage in some of the first actions of thewar and early attracted the notice of

castaldo was appointed commander in chiefagainst the turks in hungary and the french chevalieraccompanied his patron to this new scene of military enterprisecharles had felt dissatisfied with the grounds andmotives of war between the catholics and protestants ofgermany men worshipping the same saviour and appealingto the same authorities but many of them at leastfrom the most upright and ingenuous scruples differing intheir interpretation of those authorities but in their contentionsbetween the crescent and the cross he enteredwith unbounded enthusiasm into all the feelings that constitutea champion or a martyr he conceived that whateverwas dear to the human race in this world or the nexthung on the issue he regarded the grandeur of the causeas purifying his efforts and consecrating his name andwhen he lifted his sword in vindication of an expiringgod he felt himself steeled with more than mortal energymy son dwelt on the merits of his patron with a degreeof veneration and love that knew no bounds castaldowas ranked by the consenting voice of mankind with themost accomplished generals of the age in which he lived iknew him said charles in his most private hours andstood next to and observed him in the greatest and mostcritical occasions of his life it was the least of his meritsthat he distinguished me that he took me up friendless andan orphan that under every circumstance he was morethan a father to me that he corrected my faults that heguided me with his advice that he instructed me with hiswisdom and supported me by his countenance castaldowas the most persevering and indefatigable of mankind nodifficulties could undermine his apparent serenity no accumulationof dangers could appal or perplex him victorynever robbed him of his caution misfortune anddefeat never destroyed th grandeur and elasticity of hissoul i firmly believe that no general had ever a more discouragingvariety of counteractions to struggle with theenemy was

under my general were the basest of poltroons butthey were imposed upon him by his court he was compelledto place them in important trusts and even whenin the most dastardly way they betrayed those trusts theywere by some pitiful intrigue sheltered from his disciplineand his justice the forces of castaldo were mutinousand ungovernable and he was almost constantly deniedthe funds requisite for their payf for two years the count of piadena struggled with thesecomplicated difficulties when he had obtained a hardearnedadvantage at one extremity of the kingdom hefound it rendered useless by some treachery or incapacityin the other extremity which it was instantly necessary heshould hasten to repair he quelled four alarming mutiniesby his firmness his resources and the prudent combinationof his calmness and seventy in the midst of one of hismost arduous situations he suddenly received intelligencethat the states of hungary which were at that time assembledwere debating whether they should enter into a treatywith solyman for the purpose of placing their countryunder the turkish sceptre he immediately flew to theplace of council the decision in favour of solyman wasdrawn up and ready to be adopted but castaldo by hispresence his authority and his eloquence recalled thestates to their duty and prevented them from eternallystaining the christian name surrounded with these difficultiesopposed to an enemy many times more numerousthan the forces he could bring against them and whosewants were all plentifully supplied castaldo by his singleabilities kept the balance even or rather caused it to inclinein favour of the christian scale but what added charlesavails the most consummate merit how may the mostincessant and undaunted exertions be shadowed by the veilof obscurity the world judges by events success isnecessary to procure the palm of fame after two yearsof such labours as i witnessed and glory to describe a mutravelsof st leoxtiny broke out

distressthey had been deaf to the remonstrances of theirgeneral when he sought to direct them against the enemybut when they saw him submitting himself to their rageand impatience and fearlessly intrusting his safety tothose who had before refused even to listen to him andwho had reason to fear his retribution as their accuser andjudge they were awed and speechless they almost repentedof their frenzy and were half determined to returnto their duty their remorse indeed was imperfect andineffectual but castaldo led this band of mutineersthrough the heart of the kingdom with as many symptomsof regularity modesty and order as if they had beenthe best paid the promptest and most loyal army in theworldmy son spoke in terms of the warmest enthusiasm ofthe defence of erlau in the period of castaldo's last andmost arduous campaign against the turks in respect offortifications the town was scarcely competent to resist thefeeblest enemy but its deficiency in this point was suppliedby the constancy and valour of its garrison and inhabitantsthe very women displayed an enterprise thatthe more vigorous sex have seldom exhibited jn one instancea heroine of this sort was seen

no such virtueas i have described never could have been conceivedbut in the bosom of truth great as is the pious devotioni feel for that god who died on the cross for the salvationof mankind i own my weakness if it be a weakness hiscause is scarcely less endeared to me by the sublime exertionsof his heroic followers than by his own adorablecondescension and mercywhen the glorious castaldo departed with his rebelliousarmy for the metropolis of germany there was nothing imore earnestly desired than to accompany his march forseven years he had conferred on me the benefits and showntowards me the affection of a father and i could not thinkof being separated from him without the extremest anguishbeside i regarded it as little less than sacrilege to quit hisside at a time that he was exposed to

it was in his power to confersince the retreat of castaldo the christian standard hasobtained little more either of attention or aid from ourlawful sovereign now the possessor of the imperial throneferdinand for a great part of this time has had his negotiatorsat constantinople whom the insulting turk hascondescended neither sincerely to treat with nor to dismissthe christian army in hungary has been left to its ownresources but zeal has supplied the place of magazinesand religious ardour has taught us to omit no occasion ofannoying and distressing the enemy the most considerableoccurrence of this period has been the siege of ziget aboutfour years ago solyman taking advantage of certain factiousbroils among our hereditary nobility appointed at thattime one of his eunuchs bashaw of buda and havingplaced a numerous a numerous army under his commanddismissed him from the foot of his throne with this arrogantinjunction not to enter the capital of his province till hehad first sent the keys of ziget as an offering to his royaltravels of st leon master horatio the christian governor of this fortificationis one of the most accomplished and the bravest ofour native commanders and nadasti having sent him areinforcement the better to enable him to support thethreatened siege i was in the number of the soldiers appointedon this service the trenches were opened earlyin june and the siege continued for the space of sevenweeks the bashaw though an eunuch in person stuntedand of monstrous deformity was distinguished for an uncommondegree of audacity and perseverance four timeshe filled the dikes of the fortification with wood and earthand as often by means of a furious sally of the besiegedthe materials which had thus with vast expence of industryand labour been accumulated were set fire to and consumedon the twelfth day of the siege he gained possessionof the town and drove us back into the citadel but on the day following we recovered the ground we hadlost and from that time the town was his no more theactions of these days were the severest of the whole siege we fought the enemy street by street and inch by inch the great fountain in the marketplace ran with blood weascended hills of the dead which the infidels opposed as abarrier to our further progress i seized two turkishstandards and though wounded pursued the enemythrough the eastern gate and returned in triumph nafastiin the sixth week of the siege marched to our relief but he was met and worsted by the bashaw who returnedvictorious to the foot of the walls during the whole ofthe siege mutual animosity was cherished by every speciesof contrivance and the heads of the distinguished deadwere exhibited on both sides as spectacles of abhorrenceand terror the inflamed passions of the combatants severaltimes found a vent in listed duels horatio thegovernor killed in one of these encounters a gigantic turkwho had sent a proud defiance to our host i procuredmyself honour upon a similar occasion and the scarfwhich i now wear composed the turban of the infidel islew at length the disappointed bashaw was obliged toraise the siege and he soon after died of grief and mortificationin his palace at buda i confess i recollect the travels of st leonchristian exploits in the defence of ziget in which i alsohad a share with rapture and delight they will serve toawaken in me new animation when hereafter the coldnessof ordinary life might strike palsy to my soul i shallnever think i have lived in vain after having contributedin however humble a place to arrest the career of insolenceand impiety which under the standard of the crescentthreatened to overrun the whole christian worldsuch were the adventures and such the sentiments of thegallant chevalier de damville i had been a warrior in myyouth and the discourse he held was sufficiently congenialto my earliest propensities i saw indeed that he hadgained in the zeal of a soldier of the cross a source of martialheroism to which my military history had been astranger but though i could not entirely enter into thissentiment of his and indeed regarded it as an infatuationand delusion i did not the less admire the grandeur of soulwith which this heroic fable inspired him there was nopresent propensity in my heart that led me to delight indeeds of blood and war i saw them in their genuine colourswithout varnish or disguise i hated and loathedthem from my very inmost soul but notwithstanding thisi was sensible to the lustre which military zeal cast roundthe character of my son nor is this incredible or absurd the qualities of a generous and enterprising champion aretruly admirable though the direction they have receivedshould be worthy of eternal regretcharles de damville was my friend and when i saythis i cannot help stopping a moment for the indulgenceof reflecting on the contrast between my present intercoursewith my son and my late connection with bethlem gabori had sought the friendship of the hungarian partisanpartly because i wanted a protector and an ally but partlyalso because in my soul i looked up to and admired theman i called bethlem gabor my friend i persuadedmyself that i had cogent reasons for calling him so butthere was little sympathy between us he was wrapped upin his own contemplations he was withered by his owncalamities our souls scarcely touched in a single pointno no this is not friendshiptravels of st leon friendship is a necessity of our nature the stimulatingand restless want of every susceptible heart how wretchedan imposture in this point of view does human life for themost part appear with boyish eyes full of sanguinespirits and hope we look round us for a friend j we sinkinto the grave broken down with years and infirmities andstill have not found the object of our search we talk toone man and he does not understand us we address ourselvesto another and we find him the unreal similitudeonly of what we believed him to be we ally ourselves toa man of intellect and of worth upon further experiencewe cannot deny him either of these qualities but the morewe know each other the less we find of resemblance heis cold where we are warm j he is harsh where we aremelted into the tenderest sympathy what fills us with raptureis regarded by him with indifference we finish witha distant respect where we looked for a commingling soulthis is not friendship we know of other men we haveviewed their countenances we have occasionally sat in theirsociety we believe it is impossible we should not find inthem the object we sought but disparity of situation anddissimilitude of connections prove as effectual a barrier tointimacy as if we were inhabitants of different planetsit is one of the most

suddenlysensible of my powers and my worth the blood thatslept in my heart circulates and distends every vein itread on air i feel a calm yet ravishing delight i knowwhat kind of an endowment life is to a being in whomsentiment and affection are awakened to their genuineactionthis was the effect of the mutual attachment producedbetween me and charles i looked into him and saw aman i saw expansive powers of intellect and true sensibilityof heart to be esteemed and loved and protected bysuch a man to have him to take one by the hand to enquireinto one's sorrows to interest himself in one's anxieties toexult in one's good fortune and one's joys this and thisonly deserves the name of existencei had however a painful drawback upon my satisfactionit was my fate since the visit of the

consciousness that hunted my stepsand blasted me with its aspect whichever way we turnedchapter xlvamong the various confidences reposed in me by my sonone was his love the object of his attachment was ayoung lady of quality named pandora niece to nadastigreat palatine of hungary in consequence of the earnestrecommendation of castaldoin nadasti had taken myson under his particular protection and charles's principalhome at the periods when the army was dispersed in winterquarterswas at the palatine's house in the city of presburghere his manners had become more polished and his tastemore refined till then bred in tents and living amidstthe clangour of arms he had been a mere soldier roughgenerous manly and brave but nadasti was an elegantscholar smitten with that ardent love of classical andancient lore which has so eminently distinguished the sixteenthcentury he assembled round him men of lettersfrom various parts of europe and under his auspices thedays of matthias corvinus king of hungary seemed to berevived whose love of literature was such that he kept threehundred transcribers in his house constantly employed inmultiplying copies of the precious relics of roman andathenian learning the consort of nadasti was one of themost accomplished matrons of the age in which she livedand her three daughters were patterns of every polite andamiable accomplishment such was the school into whichthe chevalier de damville entered at the age of twentyfiveimmediately after the retreat of castaldo this may seeman age somewhat late for newmodelling the character

manners and the science of a militarychieftain the palace of nadasti finished and completed theeducation of my sonpandora was only fourteen years of age when charles dedamville first became a sort of inmate of the house of heruncle she at that time lived with her father but hebeing afterwards killed in the battle which nadasti foughtfor the relief of ziget pandora occupied an apartment inthe palatine palace from the first hour he saw her amere child as it were accompanied by her governess charlesconfessed to me that he had beheld her with eyes of distinctionhe had said to himself this little girl will hereafterbe a jewel worthy of the crown of an emperor hehad found something inexpressibly attractive in the starrybrightness of her complexion her air he regarded as bothlighter and more graceful than any thing he had ever beforeseen and her speaking and humid eye seemed to him thevery emblem of sensibility and sweetness if at the girlishand immature season of fourteen he had ascribed to her allthese perfections it will easily be supposed that as she increasedin stature as the beauties of form unfolded themselvesin her and she advanced in sentiment and a lovelyconsciousness of her worth the partiality of charles becamemore deep and unalterable but the orphan niece of nafastiwas altogether without a portion and the greatpalatine would have seen with more complacency the chevalierde damville addressing his pretensions to one of hisdaughterscharles confessed to me that the passion he nourishedhad been fruitful of pleasures and griefs of hope and perplexityit was now almost a year since pandora andhimself had confessed a mutual affection the confessionhad not been the result of design on either side both hadwished to suppress it pandora from virgin dignity andreserve and charles because he saw not how their affectioncould be crowned with success and he dreaded more thanany misery to himself to be the author of degradation andmisery to her he loved but what is ever uppermost inthe heart will at some time or other betray itself theirsympathetic and accordant feelings upon a point so deeplytravels op st leon interesting to both rendered them eagleeyed to discernthe smallest indications they had had a thousand opportunitiesand a thousand opportunities had been resistedthey became more than usually silent and reserved towardseach other they shunned to meet and when they metavoided each other's eyes one day a casual encounter inasolitary retreat which each had sought principally withintention to escape the presence of the other had takenthem off their guard they were mutually hesitating andperplexed each discerned more unequivocal indicationsthan had ever occurred before of the state of the other'ssentiments the entire accord snapped as it were at oncethe chains of reserve and each after a short interval ofhesitation spoke with an eloquence hitherto untried thelanguage of love the difference of years between themgave a zest to the communication pandora seemed to bethrowing herself upon the protection of an elder brotherof a guardian one in whose prudence she confided as theantidote of her inexperience charles felt his maturer yearsas imposing on him more severely that sacred integrity theobligation of which at least as society is at present constitutedseems in the majority of cases to grow out of therelative situation of the sexes of the protectorship of theone and the dependence of the otherand now exclaimed charles what am i to do what am i to desire it would be affectation in me toconceal from myself on an occasion like this that the reputationi have acquired both in the arts of peace and waris such as to have caused nadasti to set his heart uponmy becoming his soninlaw the great palatine thoughin many respects generous and liberal has that inflexiblenessof opinion which is perhaps more apt to grow up inthe hearts of scholars than in other departments of societyhe is grave and solemn all his habits are of a majesticand lordly nature and i have small reason to hope that ishall find him accessible to my representations he is littlesubject to sallies of passion his own propensities are whollyunder the control of his judgment and it is not likelythat he will make allowance for the ardent affections ofother minds pandora is entirely dependent on him ing o travels of st leonany case the portion she would receive from him would hevery inadequate to her worth but discarded and discountenancedby him who has the absolute rule of christianhungary what can she expect i am myself

pleasure shall i make pandora the inhabitantof tents and encampments shall i expose her toall the changes and hazards of a military life shall i dragher as the attendant of a soldier of fortune through everyclimate of europe no by heavens i should regardmyself as the most selfish and the basest of mankind if icould deliberate on such a question never shall the charmerof my soul owe a single privation to her charles i loveher with so pure and entire a passion that i prefer herprosperity to every earthly good nor is it merely necessaryto my attachment that she should live in plenty and ease i require that my pandora should be seen in her nativelustre that she should be surrounded with every appendagedue to her merit that she should command applause fromthe mercenary and homage from the superficial herpraise is the only music i enjoy i could not bear to hearher name coupled with levity and scorn i could not bearthat where she appeared every eye should not be turnedto her with reverence and honour my passion i confessit is that of a disciple of liberal arts and a nobleman notthat of an arcadianthe period of the campaign now drew to an end andcharles having requested me to accompany him set outfor his usual winter retreat in the city of presburg i sawpandora never in my life had i beheld any thing sosweetly simple i had always been an admirer of the sex but the perfections of pandora were of a nature that i hadnot observed in any other woman her symmetry was soperfect the pearly lustre of her skin so admirable and herform and carriage so light and ethereal that at first view itwas difficult to persuade one's self that she was framed ofthe same gross materials as the rest of the species sheseemed not constructed to endure the shocks of the worldand the rude assaults of ill humour or neglect of censure ortravels of st leon adversity her voice was of the sweetest the clearest andsoftest tone i ever heard there was a peculiar naivete inher accents that riveted your soul in irresistible fettersher conversation for in the sequel i enjoyed much of herconversation had a very uncommon zest she seemed tohave no art and what she uttered appeared as if wholly uncheckedby consideration or reserve you were persuadedthat she always delivered without restraint the first thingthat occurred to her mind yet in what she said there wasso much good sense so much true feeling and as the occasionallowed so much whim and imagination that you couldnot discover how any of her words could be changed butfor a worse this circumstance strikingly contrasted withthe childish simplicity or rather the feminine softness andsylphlike delicacy of her manner and her tone the oppositionof appearance between her and my son made astrong impression upon me he was a perfect soldier withan ample chest broad shoulders and a figure though gracefuland well proportioned yet so strong that it seemedframed to contend with and to conquer the wrestlers in thegrecian games his complexion shaded with luxuriantcurls of manly hair was itself made brown with the rigoursof climate pandora was so heavenly fair so sweetly delicateand slender that you would have thought she would bewithered and destroyed in his embrace like the frailest ornamentof the garden before the northern breeze butcourage to choose what is rugged and manlike is often characteristicof the softest of her sexi speedily contracted an intimate commerce with thebeautiful pandora i was naturally desirous to be as consummatea judge as possible of those perfections which ibelieved fated to determine the future happiness of my sonwhen sufficiently satisfied in that respect i still continuedthe indulgence and found a pure and exquisite pleasure inthe daily contemplation of accomplishments that were toprove the materials of his gratification and delight whosegratification i preferred to my own i had a still furtherview in this commerce i was anxious to be perfectly informedof the connections and family of pandora that uponthem i might build a project i had deeply at heart of beg travels of st leonstowing on her in the least questionable and exceptionablemanner a dowry that should place her upon an equalitywith her cousins the daughters of nadasti and deliver myson from all apprehension of the unpleasing consequencesto result from the resentment of the great palatine nafastiwas opulent and the portions of his daughters veryconsiderable and however inclined i could not exceedthis limit without risking the entire miscarriage of my projectcharles thought nothing too rich either in situationor income to do honour to the mistress of his soul butseparately from this enthusiastic sentiment both he andpandora had too just a taste not to prefer the simple majestyof ancient nobility to the expensive ostentations ofmodern refinementhaving digested my plan i was obliged to travel as faras venice for the execution of it the mother of pandorahad been a venetian and the uncle of her mother was oneof the adventurers who had sailed with pizarro for the conquestof peru he had died before the completion of thatbusiness and had left behind him no relative so near tohim in blood as the lovely pandora by a singular pieceof good fortune i encountered at venice an individual whohad sailed in the same ship with the young lady's unclethe uncle having died prematurely the share he mightotherwise have obtained of the spoils of peru was sunk inthe shares of the rest and nothing was allowed to remainthat might have descended to his heirs his friend andcountryman i found though once rich with the booty hemade had by a series of calamities before he reached hisnative home been reduced to a state of poverty the vicissitudeshe experienced had produced in him the effectof a very uncommon eagerness for acquisition this mani fixed on for my instrument i opened to him my planand offered him a very ample gratification provided heacted successfully the part i assigned him in concert witheach other we digested and forged the various documentsthat were best calculated to give credibility to the talehaving completed our arrangement i set out for presburgwithout a moment's delay and directed my venetian not tofollow till after a stipulated interval he was not to entertravels of st leon into full possession of his reward till he had completed thetask he had undertaken it was fixed that no person inhungary should be acquainted with my visit to venicebut only be allowed to understand generally that i had beenengaged for a certain time in an excursion of amusementso hard is the fate of the possessor of the philosopher'sstone and so limited his power as to have rendered allthese precautions on my part indispensably necessary hadnot the various circumstances concurred

eminentlyfavourable even though i should have succeeded inmisleading every other party i could not hope to haveeluded the perspicacity and jealous honour of my sonwhen i returned to presburg i again renewed my intercoursewith pandora the passion entertained by damvillefor the beautiful orphan was a secret to every personat court they had managed so discreetly as to have avoidedevery hint of suspicion and as it was universally knownthat the great palatine had an eye on this gallant soldier forone of his daughters few persons entertained a doubt thatmy son would speedily declare his election among the coheiressesof nadasti on the other hand in the friendlyintercourse between me and pandora neither she nor myselffelt that there was any thing to conceal and it wastherefore a matter of complete notoriety my bloomingyouth of appearance was remarked by the majority ofbystanders we were judged formed for each other andbefore i was aware the beautiful hungarian was awardedto me by the general voice as my destined bride whenhowever became acquainted with the rumour i was contentedto smile at it the consciousness in my own breasthow far the public sagacity had wandered in its guess gaveto that guess in my apprehension a certain air of whimsicaland amusingg q travels of st leonchapter xl visuch was the situation of the affair of pandora and i dailylooked for the arrival of

neverto have been modulated into an expression of heavinessi was in the highest degree anxious to learn the causeof this revolution and was the farthest in the world fromsuspecting its real foundation i pursued pandora withso much importunity and demanded an interview with suchirresistible earnestness that she at length consented to grantit we met in a remote part of the garden whyhenry said she do

this noble mind bearme witness heaven nothing could be more innocent thanthe correspondence i allowed myself to hold with you myadorable charles was continually calling you brother iscarcely ever heard him speak of you by any other appellationi regarded charles as my husband i already viewedyou in anticipation as the brother of my lord excludedas i was from frequent conversation with him whom i mostloved i endeavoured to supply the deficiency by an unreservedcommunication with you the extreme resemblanceof your persons increased my gratification you were hispicture his speaking image while i looked at you isaid e such once was my charles before he was the greatman the gallant soldier the accomplished cavalier theadored object that now engrosses my affections beside iknew that charles loved you as much as he did any man onearth and that knowledge made you dear to me you travels of st leonwere constantly eager to dwell upon and describe his excellences could i fail to be pleased with your conversation i own that the pleasure i took in it was unbounded andthe emotions it awakened in my affectionate heart deliciousbut all this candidly explained was only an additionalproof of the tenderness and constancy of my earliest attachmentand now ever since the fatal day in which this conversationpassed with my charles he is absent from courtand i know not whither he is gone he has disdained toseek any further explanation nor do i know how to appealto his calmer feelings and more deliberate mind onething however i had determined on and that was henrystrictly to avoid your societyi trust wherever my charles is he will hear of thisi owe this expiation to his agonised feelings and to theappearances that in some degree justify his misconstructioni will wait patiently till the simplicity and singleness ofmy conduct have cleared my faith if i should otherwisehave found pleasure and relief in your society i will makea merit with myself of sacrificing this to the apprehensivedelicacy of my charles's mind in this single instanceyour importunity has prevailed with me to dispense withmy rule you were not to blame and i thought upon moremature reflection that i owed you an explanation buthenceforth if you have any kindness for me or value forhim who has acted and felt towards you like a brother imust entreat you to cooperate with me in this and thatwhether in public or private we may bestow no notice oneach other and avoid all opportunities of communicationto persuade you to this was indeed a principal inducementwith me so far to deviate from the rule i had laid down tomyself as to admit this conversationi was extremely affected with the unhappiness of pandorai exerted myself to console her i promised thatnothing on my part should be wanting to remove everyshadow of doubt that hung upon her fidelity and i exhortedher to believe that every thing would infallibly terminatein the way most honourable arid gratifying to herselfpandora listened to me and dried her tears the contravelsop st leon 'sensation was interesting and soothing to us both weregarded it as the last unreserved and sympathetic communicationwe should ever have with each other it insensiblygrew longer and longer and we knew not how to putan end to it we were still in this state of irresolutionwhen looking up i perceived charles danville approachingfrom the further end of the walk that led to the alcovei would have withdrawn i was anxious to remove theunjust suspicion that hung upon his mind but the instantthat presented to him so strong an apparent confirmation ofthem the instant that by so doing must have worked up hissoul into tumult did not appear a favourable one for explanationto withdraw was impossible pandora haddiscerned her lover at the same moment with myself shewas seized with a faintness she would have sunk to theground but i caught her in my arms i rested with oneknee on the earth her head was reclined on my bosomcharles approached with a quicker pace c rise said he this is beyond my hopes i left presburg with the purpose of not revisiting it for years butas i proceeded further and further from a place which hadlately been the centre of my affections i began to doubtwhether i had not acted with precipitation and to believethat there was yet some uncertainty hanging on my fatethe seemingly earnest protestations of this delusive syrenrung in my ears mechanically without any formed resolutioni changed my course and returned on my stepsmy doubts are now at an end i find you taking instantadvantage of my absence to throw yourselves into eachother's arms the feelings i so lately uttered in your presencepandora would have kept you apart if my feelingshad been in the least sacred in your eyes if all my surmiseshad not been too true he took by the hand theweeping pandora and led her to the seat which a littlebefore she had quittedwhy all this artifice why all this deceit it is saidthat we are not masters of our own hearts and that nohuman passion is formed to endure for ever influencedby these maxims i could have pardoned your inconstancytoo fair too fickle pandora but why strain every nerve travels op st leonto make me believe you still retained a passion you haddiscarded to subject me to the lingering torture of deceitinstead of communicating to me a truth agonising indeedto human frailty but calculated to inspire fortitude anddecision this i cannot excuse this racks me with thebitterest of disappointments disappointment in the virtuesi had ascribed to you and convinces me that you areneither worthy of me nor worthy of happinessand you too d'aubigny you have acted a part in thisunworthy plot i rescued you from prison from a dungeonfrom which a few hours before you had no hope ofcoming forth alive i took you under my protection whenyou had no friend i placed you next myself i conceivedfor you the affection of a brother loved you next indegree to the mistress of my soul in return for all thati have done and all that i felt for you you have withinsidious heart and every base disguise seduced from me thewoman of my choice why not frankly and ingenuouslyhave demanded her at my hands the heart is free your reciprocal passion though i might have regretted iti should have been unable to blame it is the cloak thatyou have drawn over it that proves the baseness of itsorigin do you think i had not the courage cheerfullyand without a murmur to resign to you this illustrious fairone i feel that i was worthy to be openly treated hadi seen in you a mutual and ingenuous passion i would nothave been the bar to its just consummation i would nothave sought the person of a woman whose heart in spiteperhaps of her better resolutions was given to another ishould loathe myself for ever were i capable of such a partit was the sympathetic sentiment towards me beating inaccord to the sentiment of my own bosom that i once sawin pandora and not either her peerless beauties or the excellencesi imputed to her mind that formed the mastercharmwhich fascinated my soul i feel that i had theforce in the negation of my own happiness to have drawncomfort and compensation from the happiness of two creaturesi so dearly loved as d'aubigny and pandorasi sought to interrupt my son i could no longer bear tosee him involved in so painful an error and not exert everynerve to rescue him from it but his passions werewrought higher than mine he would not suffer me tospeakbe silent d'aubigny i cannot brook to be interruptednow my heart is full and i must have leave toutter the sentiments that agitate and distend ithe advanced towards pandora he took hold of herhandrise madam i shall not long trouble you with theboisterous impetuousness of my passions do not resist menow she rose and followed him her face still covered withher handkerchief and drowned in tears he led her to thefront of the alcove he motioned me to approach withhis other hand he took hold of mine he seemed to liftpandora's hand to his lips as if to kiss it with a suddenstart he put it down again he held it below the level ofhis breastduring this scene pandora and myself were speechlessmost women in the situation of pandora would i supposehave spoken and have been eager to vindicate themselvesfrom so groundless an imputation but what she did waspeculiar to the delicacy and defencelessness of her personalcharacter she was overwhelmed and incapable of effortfor my own part my feelings were uncommonly complicatedmy apparent situation was a plain one the situationof a youth mistaken by his friend for the seducer of themistress of that friend and had my feelings been merelyrelative to this situation i could undoubtedly have spokenwithout embarrassment but with this were involved thesentiments originating in my secret character the sentimentsof a man anxious to benefit and who had devotedhimself to the interests of another of a father tremblinglyalive to the happiness of his son and eager to dive into hissoul that he might the more sensibly admire his virtuesand with a more enlightened skill secure his fortune i wassilent charles de damville proceeded fc thus said he i join your hands thus i withdraw travels of st leonall my claims upon pandora thus i remove every impedimentto your wishes this pandora this d aubignyi was capable of if you had treated me honourably andavowed an honest passion you do not know charles dedamville you have treated me as none but the mostgroveling soul could deserve to be treated had you beeningenuous i should have a consolation in what i am doingthat now i cannot have i can no longer persuade myselfthat i am joining two worthy hearts to each other i canno longer relieve the bitterness of my own disappointmentby the image of your future felicity may i be mistaken may you be truly happy in each other you cannot behappy beyond the wishes formed in your favour by himwho will remember to the latest hour of his existence howmuch his heart was devoted to you bothsaying this he burst away from us abruptly and disappearedat first as i listened to the heroic language ofmy son i asked myself whether it were the expression ofa warm heart or a cold one it costs nothing to a coldheart to ape the language of heroism and to pretend tomake the greatest sacrifices when its constitution has renderedall effort unnecessary to the feat but i looked inthe face of charles and forgot my doubts his voice hehad indeed wound up to the tone of his speech it was alittle tremulous but in the main firm serious deliberateand elevated but his countenance was the picture of distressthere sat enthroned defying all banishment anddisguise the anguish of his soul his eye was haggard his complexion was colourless and wan he had been absentseveral days from presburg his appearance told methat he could scarcely either have eaten or slept during theperiod of his absence he might talk of the generositywith which he could resign pandora i read in his facewhat that resignation had cost and would go on to costhim ingenuous noblehearted charles i doubted whetherbut for a reverse of the events he apprehended hewould be able to survive ithe had no sooner left us than i applied myself to comfortpandora i swore to her that in spite of every temporarycloud i would yet witness the union of her and hertravels of st leon adored chevalier i assured her that i would not rest tilli had forced damville to hear me and compelled him tocredit the sincerity of my talehow many things were there that in the scene whichhad just passed i might have urged in answer to damvillebut respecting which my situation imposed upon me themost rigorous silence i might have said you call yourselfmy protector my benefactor my patron the real relationbetween us is the reverse of the picture you havedrawn i want not your protection j i am qualified if iplease to be a patron to all the world i am meditatingthe most generous things in your behalf this perfidiousfriend as you deem him has devoted all his thoughts andpostponed all his gratifications that he might prove himselfsubstantially arid in the most important particulars yourfriendmore than this i might have said i might have said i am your father i have no inclinations no passions contraveningyour gratification i love you with more thanafather's love i transfer to you all the affection i entertainedfor your peerless murdered mother all my studyis your happiness you are to me the whole world andmore than the whole world extensive and singular as aremy prerogatives i fold them up i forget them all andthink of you alonei cannot give a stronger proof than is contained in whati have here stated of the misery of my condition i wascheated as i have once before remarked with the form ofa man but had nothing of the substance i was endowedwith the faculty of speech but was cut off from its properand genuine use i was utterly alone in the world separatedby an insurmountable barrier from every being of myspecies no man could understand me no man couldsympathise with me no man could form the remotest guessat what was passing in my breast i had the use of words i could address my fellowbeings i could enter into dialoguewith them i could discourse of every indifferentthing that the universe contained i could talk of everythingbut my own feelings this and not the dungeon of travels of st leonbethlem gabor is the true solitude let no man afterme pant for the acquisition of the philosopher's stone charles de damville had again left presburg the veryinstant he quitted the alcove when i inquired for himin the palace i received this afflicting intelligence i didnot hesitate a moment in resolving that i would pursuehis steps it was of the utmost consequence that i shouldovertake him all that was most interesting to me hungupon our interview the preparations however of myjourney though followed with ardour inevitably reducedme to the being some hours in the rear of my son i wascontinually in his track but could not come up with him to judge from events you would have supposed that he hadas strong a motive to fly as i had to pursue he led mealong the course of the danube to the source of that farfamedand munificent riveri reached the passage of the rhine and was on the pointof crossing into alsace but here i lost all notice of charles no enquiry i could make was effectual to procure me theslightest intelligence he had not crossed the river hehad proceeded neither to the right nor the left along itsbanks i was disappointed mortified and distressed whatwas i to do next could i return to pandora whattale must i relate to this adorable creature whom i hadurged to depend upon my exertions could i leave herhowever to the anguish and uncertainty that must followupon her hearing no more either from her lover or myself i think i never felt more truly depressed than in thisconjuncture most amply most critically did the curse ofthe opus magnum attend upon my projects and render allmy exertions abortive it was the same whether my planswere formed upon a larger or a smaller scale when iendeavoured to live in total obscurity in madrid when iundertook to be the steward and the father of the people ofhungary and now that with a chastised ambition i soughtwhat is permitted to all other human creatures to providefor the honourable settlement of my only son still still myevil genius pursued me and blasted every concern in whichi presumed to interfere i had intruded between two faithfullovers unfortunate they had been indeed and consignof st leon durable obstacles were interposed to their felicity butobstacles are commonly found to yield to firmness and constancy and without my fatal interference charles andpandora would one day have been happy if by adversefates they had hitherto been kept asunder still they understoodeach other and rejoiced in their mutual confidenceand attachment this the consolation of all their sorrowsand disappointments it was mine to have destroyed theglobe for aught i knew would speedily be interposed betweenthem and here i stood in the middle point like oneof those invincible repulsive powers hid in the storehouseof nature forbidding to them all future retrogression to eachotherchapter xlviithe picture which my distracted fancy thus set before theeye of my mind was not altogether verified in the eventafter a thousand fruitless inquiries and perquisitions ifound to my utter astonishment that charles arrestinghis career at the town of fribourg had returned upon hissteps and sought a second time the metropolis of austrianhungary this was of the class of those events which wesometimes meet with in the world that baffle all calculationand strike us like magic or like madness in theirauthorsi had nothing to do as i conceived on this occasionbut to follow the example of my son and like him to resumethe route of presburg i yet hoped to witness if not tocooperate in the reconciliation of charles and pandoramy spirits in this respect were revived and my prospectsmade brighter by the thoughts that these virtuous andmeritorious lovers were at last likely to be once again inclosedwithin the cincture of the same city add to whichmy venetian confederate had not yet made his appearanceat presburg and not only was i under engagements togive him the meeting there but it was also clear that hishh travels of st leonerrand could not be brought to its proper close without myassistancei once more entered the city to which pandora owedher birth charles de damville had preceded my arrivalseveral days i should without delay have repaired to hisapartments but that i found at my own lodgings a letterfrom benevento cabriera of venice informing me that hewas now in presburg and to avoid all cause for suspicionhad taken up his residence in a remote quarter of thetown from the enquiries i made i became satisfiedthat my son had in some degree resumed his usual occupationsand that there was no appearance of his again immediatelyquitting the metropolis i therefore felt my transactionwith cabriera more urgent than an immediateconference with charles though i had sought that conferencewith earnest expedition yet i dreaded it it mightrequire the maturest consideration and the nicest managementto render it effectual for the purposes i sought ifound from certain intelligence that damville and pandorahad yet had no explanation with each other i thereforeregarded my exertions for that purpose as a final effort and i was willing that every thing should be in train andthe portion of pandora fully adjusted before i enteredupon that interesting scene with cabriera i had littledifficulty the documents and evidences of his tale wehad concerted at venice and i presently found that hetold his story so plausibly and supported it so consistentlythat it was admitted by every one without the smallestsuspicionno sooner had cabriera opened his business to the partiesto whom the cognisance of it most properly belongedthan i once more presented myself to the beautiful and engagingniece of nadasti the instant i entered her apartmenti was shocked with the extreme change of her personalappearance all the airiness alertness and vivacitythat had once so exquisitely adorned her were gone theroses in her cheek were faded and had given place to a delicatebut sickly paleness her arms though always whatis called white had before been round and had been distinguishedby the purest hue of health they were nowtravels op st leon emaciated skinny and colourless her eyes were hollowand her eyelids inflamed with weeping all these changeshad taken place in about five weeks that had elapsed sincei saw her last i was so struck with the sight that involuntarilystarted and could scarcely command myselfenough to refrain from tears it was plain that she carriedan arrow in her bosom which one hand only in theuniverse could extract with safety as i approached sheraised her lovely head that had been depressed with griefand lifted her white arms with an expression of despairff come nearer my sweet henry said she i rejoiceto see you though you have proved my worst enemy thedestroyer of my peace but your intentions my kind boymy brother for such i will still call you have always beengood and innocent but ah henry you have deludedme you urged me to banish despair and every day i seemore reason to despair i asked if she had not seen the chevalier since his returnto presburgit were better for me replied pandora e if i hadnot seen him what has really happened is worse than ifi had been denied to see him i have met him every dayin the apartments of my aunt to an indifferent eye itwould have appeared as if he neither sought nor avoidedme he carries himself towards me with a cold and constrainedcivility but he neither demands an interviewnor allows me the opportunity to utter a word to him inprivate oh d'aubigny i see too well that i have losthim for ever when he fled my presence when he resolvedto seek some distant region cruel as that conduct was itconvinced me that was of some importance to him butnow he passes by me in stern neglect he has utterly drivenme from his heart indeed my brother this last blow istoo much i feel that i shall never recover itand does the chevalier cried i appear at his easedoes he exhibit the wonted symptoms of his health andtriumphant spiritf away too pleasing deluder replied pandorac cheat me not with false hopes flatter me not with unrealexpectations damville does not appear to be well

as when i press despair firmly tomy breastbut you henry continued she are probably uninformedof my last and severest misfortune i had a greatuncle in the list of the adventurers that achieved the conquestof peru he has died and unexpectedly bequeathed meafortune that sets the portionless pandora upon a level withthe wealthy heiresses of the great palatine himself for along time want of fortune was the only obstacle that stoodbetween me and all my hopes of happiness now thatpoverty is no longer an evil to me and wealth no longerdesirable i have obtained this unwelcome acquisitionyou can have no conception how painful a sensation isproduced by this mockery the gift of ample possessions tothe votary of despairi endeavoured somewhat to encourage pandora but sheobstinately rejected my soothing i was the less importunateon this subject as since the return of my son ipersisted to persuade myself that i should soon have somethingmore substantial to offer her on his part than mereguesses and conjectures the day after this conversationi boldly sought the presence of the chevalier till theni had since our return to presburg avoided to meet himi now resolved to force from him a hearing to assurehim with the most solemn asseverations of my own innocenceand the constancy of his mistress to represent tohim in how eminent a degree the newly acquired estate ofpandora was calculated to facilitate their mutual wishes and finally to offer him any pledge he should desire of thesincerity of my declarations even to the banishing myselffrom the presence and intercourse of him and the lovelypandora for everwhen i saw my son his appearance and air advanceda forcible claim on my compassion i will not now describethem suffice it that they completely proved howtrue was the sympathy even to the minutest particularsbetween him and his mistress the difference was only intravels of st leonkind and not in degree hers a defenceless a delicate andtruly feminine grief while his

resolutely smoothed his manly front and the loftinessof his spirit produced on his cheek a generous and a settledblushi have just said that i had resolved to force from him ahearing i was mistaken in

you have recently thoughtproper to confide your projects and your unfortunate passionfor the charming pandora what you related to meon the subject convinced me how much she was unworthyof your love and how basely she has conducted herselftowards you yet you will yourself feel some compassionfor her when you learn who it is upon whom she has travels op st leonstowed this unmerited preference know then that thiswretched d'aubigny is no other than the notorious cotillonthe infamous impostor who by his machinationsabout a year ago preserved the turkish provinces of hungaryfrom being conquered by the christian arms theman is moreover a magician the pretended or real possessorof the philosopher's stone he is therefore doublyworthy of death first as a traitor the abettor and comforterof the common enemy of the christian faith andsecondly as a dealer in the black art and a man notoriouslysold and delivered over to the devil i have received this information from the most unquestionableauthority a soldier in my old corps who haslately escaped from a turkish prison no sooner saw himthan he identified his person i happened to be near thefellow at the moment when by an unexpected exclamationhe betrayed his discovery it immediately struck me thatthe circumstance might be of importance to your interests and therefore taking the soldier aside i charged him notto mention to any one what he had observed to renderhis secrecy the more secure i have since removed him toa garrison at some distance from presburg and i havemyself mentioned the circumstance to no living creaturethat i might first receive your instructions on the subjectand act in all respects concerning it as you shall judgeproper the blackness of the character of the man sets allexaggeration at defiance this very individual whom youliberated from the bowels of the earth who by the mosttreacherous arts won your confidence and upon whom youlavishly heaped every imaginable distinction was all thewhile conscious to himself that he was the character thatof all that live you hated most in one word the renegadochatillon he acted consistently with his preceding conductand his recent disingenuousness when he seducedfrom you the affections of the woman of your choicei am concerned to add that on the very day that imade this discovery this chatillon d'aubigny disappearedfrom presburg nor can i by any effort learn whither he isgone it is impossible he should have been informed by anyhuman means of the detection that had happened but indeedtravels of st leon it is vain to attempt to form any reasonable conjecture respectinga character so mysterious and inexplicableyour devoted friendandrew count of batherfc well sir seeing i had finished the perusal andwhat have you now to allege when i saw you simply asthe favoured lover of pandora however treacherous and dishonourablei might deem your conduct towards me i quittedthe field i did not trust myself to be a judge in my owncause i did not confide in my estimate of your unworthinesswhen i was myself wholly concerned i hadsome time before received an invitation from the duked'aumale who was collecting a number of generous andhighspirited nobles to accompany mary queen of scotsto the barbarous fields of her native realm i at first declinedi now accepted the invitation i set out for paristo join him i found that

heard of you again and againon my route as i returned from fribourg i arrive atpresburg and presently after you again make your appearancewhat further villanies have you to act what newtreacheries have you devised against me this morning iconsented to the representations of count bather and agreedthat you should be delivered up to justice why then areyou not in custody e when i consider the mystery and inscrutableness ofyour character i am lost in conjecture you are said to beamagician a dealer in the unhallowed secrets of alchymyand the elixir mice in cases like this all the ordinaryrules of human sagacity and prudence are superseded thewisest man is a fool and the noblest spirit feels the veryground he stood on struck from under his feet how cani know that the seduction of pandora's affections is notowing to magical incantations who in that case is ratheran object for compassion than for censure how can i tellthat the fraternal resemblance borne by your features to travels op st leonmy own and the sudden and ardent partiality that rose inmy breast when first i saw you have not been produced bythe most detested arts magic dissolves the whole principleand arrangement of human action subverts all generousenthusiasm and dignity and renders life itself loathsomeand intolerablethis is to me the most painful of all subjects i had afather whom i affectionately loved he became the dupe ofthese infernal secrets i had a mother the paragon of thecreation that father murdered her all the anguish iever felt has derived its source from alchymy and magicwhile the infamous chatillon thus stands before me i feelall the longforgotten wounds of my heart new opened andthe blood bursting afresh from every vein i have restedand been at peace and now

all that is past you have once againintruded into my presence i here bind myself by all that issacred to pursue you to the deathwhat could i answer to such an attack i saw at oncethat the case as to all future harmony between me and myson was desperate and irremediable what hope could ientertain further what had hitherto been the result oftravels of st leon our illfated intercourse every offence and prejudice thatcan gall the human mind had been brought forward in it inturn i had wounded damville in the most sensible pointof private life and had blasted his hopes there where hestored them all i had offended his most rooted politicalprepossessions by aiding the turk and feeding a nationthat perished with hunger i was an equivocal characterassuming different names and wandering over the worldwith different pretences last of all i had revived in hismind the images of his father and his mother all that hadonce been most dear and now was most painful to his recollection and had tortured his fancy with nameless horrorsthese sentiments could never be removed all the explanationsin the world could never reconcile me to his mind and i felt that i had that within which in what was tocome as it had in what was past must for ever annihilateall confidence between us at once therefore i accepted hischallenge arranged with him the terms of a hostile encounteron the following morning and immediately after bidadieu to presburg and to the sight of every soul containedwithin its walls for everthis is i powerfully feel the last adventure that i shallever have the courage to commit to writing a few minutesmore and i will lay down my pen and resolve in the mostsolemn and sacred manner never to compose another lineindeed all other adventures must necessarily be frigid anduninteresting compared with that which i have now describedgreat god what a fate was mine anxious asi had been to prove myself in the most momentous respectsthe benefactor of my son dismissing all other thoughts andcares from my mind journeying with this sole object inview from presburg to venice and from venice topresburg from hungary to the banks of the rhine andfrom the banks of the rhine back again to hungarythe whole scene was now terminated by a declaration on hispart that nothing could appease the animosity he cherishedagainst me short of rioting in the blood of his father'sheart i was reduced to the necessity either of lifting mysword against my son of running myself upon the point ofhis weapon or of forfeiting the engagement between us travels op st leonand suffering him to brand me as a coward in the face ofchristendom i mention not this because the variety ofobjects of choice produced in me the slightest hesitationweary as i was of life i could cheerfully have consentedto die but not to stain the sword of charles de damvillewith my vital blood i prevented him from being the assassinof his father's life could not prevent him frombeing the assassin of his father's character he was assiduousand indefatigable in spreading against me the blackestinvectives which he regarded as the most unerring truthsall hungary has resounded for thirty years with the atrocitiesof the sieur de chatillon what is here recorded containsthe whole and unvarnished truth on the subjectthis narrative however shall never see the light till themelancholy hour when charles de damville shall be nomoreyet in the midst of the anguish the disappointment ofevery cherished hope which rends my soul i have oneconsolation and that an invaluable one in the virtues theglory and the happiness of my son i said i would forgetevery gratification and sentiment of my own in him i amnow more than ever instigated to do so when i quittedpresburg i left cabriera behind me in that city and itook care to obtain a parting interview with him heafterwards gave me the meeting as we then concerted attrieste in the duchy of carniola it happened as i hadflattered myself the event would prove that the visiblesource of umbrage being removed charles and pandora inno long time came to a mutual understanding and werefinally made happy in each other i had been the fortunatemeans of supplying to this excellent and incomparablecreature the only defect under which she laboured a wantof fortune her uncle having no longer a pretence tooppose their mutual passion united their hands and atthe time of which i am speaking they were regarded asthe most graceful and accomplished couple in the wholehungarian dominions the chevalier de damville is consideredin that country as the great bulwark of the christianfrontier and the most generous and illustrious pupil inthe school of the bayards and the scanderbeg cabrieratravels of st leon worn out with years and fatigues but still grasping andavaricious to his latest hour expired in my arms in thecity of trieste and by his death yielded me this contentmentthat henceforth the only obvious means for detectingmy beneficent fraud in securing the dower of pandora wasfor ever removedthat the reader may enter the more fully into my sentimentof congratulation upon the happiness of my sonand rise from the perusal of my narrative with a moresoothing and pleasurable sensation i will here shortly recapitulatethe good qualities that had been unfolded in thistruly extraordinary young man from his earliest infancyhe was a child only nine years of age at the period of thetruly affecting and exemplary behaviour the reader may rememberhim to have displayed while i was at paris squanderingthe property of my family at the gamingtable inthe alienation of mind produced in me by that dreadfulcatastrophe he was my constant attendant my carefulnurse and my affectionate friend when twelve monthsafter we were driven by our calamities out of switzerlandand i lay extended to all human appearance on the bed ofdeath charles was the comforter of his mother the friendof his sisters and even young as he was contributed to themaintenance of my starving family by the labour of his infanthands at dresden as yet no more than seventeenyears of age he was assailed by one of the severest trialswith which the mind of man can in any case be beset buthe hesitated not a moment obliged to choose betweenpoverty and innocence with the sacrifice of all his habitudesand the loss of every friend on the one side andwealth new to his enjoyment with ignominy or an equivocalcharacter on the other his determination was instantand unalterable cast at so immature an age alone andportionless upon the world he almost immediately by hisgallantry his winning qualities and his virtues gained tohimself a friend in one of the greatest captains of the ageunaided by the brilliancy of family or fortune he acquiredthe character of the bravest soldier in hungary where allwere brave this last trial to which i had been the undesigningmeans of subjecting him was none of the leasttravels of st leonarduous love often entails imbecility on the noblest ofmankind but charles surmounted the most perilous attacksof this allconquering passion when he thoughtpandora unworthy he tore himself from her and wouldnot admit a struggle when he believed she loved anotherhe disdained to claim a heart that seemed alienated fromhim and himself joined the hands of his mistress and hisrival he might have died he could not disgrace himselfi was the hero's father but no i am not blinded bypaternal partiality but no he was indeed what i thoughthim as near the climax of dignity and virtue as the frailtyof our nature will admit his virtue was at length crownedwith the most enviable reward the earth has to boastthe faithful attachment of a nobleminded and accomplishedwoman i am happy to close my eventful and somewhatmelancholy story with so pleasing a termination whatevermay have been the result of my personal experience ofhuman life i can never recollect the fate of charles andpandora without confessing with exultation that this busyand anxious world of ours yet contains something in itsstores that is worth living forthe endlondonprinted by a r spottiswoodenewstreetsquare
