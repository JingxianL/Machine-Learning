prefacei aim aware that in the present volumethere are many parts which may notat first sight appear suited to the capacitiesof children but my ownobservation leads me to think thatchildren are more apt to learn thanparents and instructors generally suppose and that their powers of mindare much strengthened by being exercisedwith topics which are sometimesdeemed too exalted or abstruseiv prefacefor their undeveloped faculties it isno doubt difficult to draw an exactline at the point beyond which it isunwise in the instructor to pursue asubject but some experiments mustbe made and the intellects of childrentried and strengthened by excursionsinto regions remote from their habitualwalks it is only thus that thestandard of mind can be raised or thepath prepared for investigations intomore distant and more elevated studiesyet i have not ventured far nor havei made my morals as i hope unintelligibleto minorsthe stormmany were the happy days which the howardfamily enjoyed always busy in improving andin serving one another kindness became thehabit of their daily existence and it was akindness without show or parade the naturalflow of minds that were training themselvesand one another to enjoyment and gatheringinstruction and practising virtue as the bestmeans of enjoymentno doubt there were now and then exhibitionsof petulance and illhumour but thesewere transitory they were the gloomy momentswhich were succeeded by sunshine andthey were not without their use for childrenvol b minor moralsare quick in observation and their young mindsare easily taught to reason on the consequencesof conduct edith was once overheard to sayhow very foolish i was to be so angry how very foolish and arthur after an occasionon which he had struck his brother withviolence not feeling courage enough to appearin the presence of the gentle edith hadhid himself in the hayloft where he sobbedand wept as if his heart were breaking andwas found in tears by one of the servants whocame to look after the horses and to whomhe confided his sorrow and his penitencego master arthur george is very forgivingand arthur went his eyes red withcrying and held out his trembling hand togeorge who shook it warmly and edithsmiled it was not necessary for either toutter a wordone stormy evening the howard familythe storm were gathered round the fire and as the windblew louder and louder edith said i fancymamma that i love you better when the tempestis so noisy because i think of the homethat shelters me and of those who make thathome so dearno doubt my child said mrs howardfor we should soon forget how much we haveto be grateful for were we not sometimescompelled to think how severe the privationwould be it is pain that teaches us the valueof health hunger and thirst enable us to estimatethe importance of food and drink thebiting cold shows us the blessings of raiment the storm makes the sunshine doubly welcome and now that the rain is driving hard againstthe windows and the loud blasts shake ourhabitation we begin to feel most sensibly whata privilege it is not to be exposed to the violminor moralshence of the weather do you remember thehurricane we witnessed on the sea shore how should i forget it mamma yourecollect we were walking on the beach ancjthe thunderclouds gathered and grew blackerand blacker and the wind became fiercer andfiercer and the waves rolled higher and higherand foamed as if they were in a passion andflung the stones and shingles on the shoreand we had great difficulty in getting homeand were drenched and almost drowned forthe heavens seemed as full of water as theocean itself and poured it out with the samevehemence was it not a terrible daymammaand was that all edith o no mamma for the dreadful thingwas to see the ships and the boats tossedabout upon the waves and to fancy we couldthe storm ohear the voices of the poor sailors and eventhat mamma was not the worst oh nothinglike it for don't you recollect how we wentto the fisherman's hut and saw the poor widowwringing her hands and some of the childrencrying and you mamma cried too and icould not help it and even now when ithink of it poor edith could not proceed she burstinto tearsshe wiped them from her cheeks and georgeran and kissed her arthur did the same forthey felt additional love for their sister wheneverher benevolent affections were displayedbut i do wish said arthur that mammawould tell us the story of the poor fisherman i do not know much of his life my boyand perhaps his life if i knew it all wouldgive but little to tell i dare say he was bredb minor moralsfrom his boyhood to the sea a fisherman aswere his fathers in the times of war nodoubt he like most of his fellows was compelledto serve the state and may have traversedthe ocean for thousands and thousandsof leagues accompanied by sad thoughts ofhome of wife and family such thoughts nodoubt he had for when he was dead everybodytold us how much he was loved lovedby his wife loved by his children i daresaythe small hut in which they dwelt wasdearer to him than any spot in th world andif he visited great ports and splendid citiesthat he often wished he could exchange thesight for one glance of the little cove in whichhe was born and where he had left his familyno doubt he did said mr howard andmamma will forgive me for interrupting herto tell you that i have heard of an instance inthe storm which a sailor after a long voyage becamestoneblind from overstraining the nerve calledthe optic nerve by which the eyes communicatewith the brain in an attempt to discovera point of land which was particularly interestingto him and i knew of a case wherethe delight of revisiting a beloved abodebrought with it a mental excitement so vehementas to end in death joy itself shouldbe moderated by reflection but go on mammathere was no such joy to precede thepoor fisherman's deathedith has told you of the violence of thetempest it was known that many vesselshad been wrecked for planks and brokenmasts and merchandise were driven on theshore the tempest had continued furiouslythrough the night and the night was one ofthick darkness the fisherman's wife felt someanxiety but not much alarm her husband minor moralswas a practised mariner and many such stormshad he mastered and come home in safetymisgivings came and went the fisherboathad gone to sea the day before again andagain had the fisherman returned in high spiritswhen ships had been driven ashore andcorpses found on the coast and he said thathis frisky for so he had named his boatwould ride in security through any gale andhe laughed at the fears which he heard sometimesexpressed vowing that frisky had learnedto dance in any waves or waters whetherhigh or lowin truth he had subdued his wife's apprehensionand imparted to her a portion ofhis own courageat break of day the morning after thestorm three of his children two girls and aboy went forth as they were wont to gatherfrom the beach such fragments as the billowsthe storm had washed upon the coast there was atsome distance from their hut a rock called'the perilous point which jutted far into thesea and which could only be passed round atlow water to proceed beyond it was so dangerousthat it was generally the terminationof the walk the tide was ebbing fastthough the billows were still agitated by theviolence of the tempest one of the childrensaid let us go home no said anotherlet us wait to go round the perilous pointwe shall soon be able the tide is lowering perhaps we shall find something yes perhapswe shall find something the others answeredthey waited they did find something it was their father's bodythe waves had left it high upon thesand the children recognised it instantlyfather father they shouted to one anon minor moralsther and shouted to the lifeless corpse thatwas at their feet they kissed it they liftedits hands they wiped away the sand from theface and the bosom they cried they ranabout wildly they threw themselves on thebeach they forgot that the tide was turninguntil one of them shrieked out wecannot pass the rock an instinct of selfpreservationstronger than any other instinctcompelled them they had to wade nearlyup to their breasts and every now and thena wave washed over them they held by oneanother and by the rock as they turned theperilous point they passed it in safety andran screaming dolefully as they ran father father ere they reached the house their motherheard them the truth rushed into her mind r where where she said and she saidthe storm nothing more the children ran before herto the rock but the tide had long beforecovered it there was no passingthe poor widow tore her hair looked ather children and while the waves were dashingaround she sat down silent as the rockand gloomy as death there she waited till thewaters fell and as they fell many and manya vain attempt did she make to pass roundthe point she was beaten back again andagain but at last forced her way while thechildren believed she would be carried off bythe waves no corpse was there nor signthat any corpse had been her children onceheard her shriek no no but could notjoin her when the tide had ebbed muchlower they got round the rock and found herlying senseless near the spot where they hadseen their dead father lie with difficultythey aroused her and forced her over the minor moralsperilous point a widow she and orphans theywalked to their desolate hut people sayshehas never smiled since then but that shewill not believe her husband is dead shehas never once talked of him to her childrenbecause she knows their testimony would interferewith her delusion he will comesome day she often is heard to whisperwould it not be charity said georgeto persuade her of the truth and that sheis deceiving herself with idle dreamsi know not why said mr howardthose dreams are hope and happiness toher perhaps and they do no harm to anyoneelse do you remember horace's storyof the maniac who reproached the medicalattendant that visited him for having curedhim of the fancy that he heard divinely harmonioussounds and brought him back in consequenceto all the discords of the world ithe storm once met in a lunatic asylum a lady whoseillusion consisted in the belief that she wasperpetually in the presence of the wise andgood of all ages hearing their words of wisdomand herself the object of their peculiaraffection she was so happy as to be enviableand when you meet with calamitymy children do not exaggerate it nor magnifyit either to yourselves or to others yourown calamities especially never attempt tomake greater than they are if others formtoo low an estimate of their calamities donot persuade them they are worse than theythink them to beuses of animals to manamong the favourite books of the howardfamily library was bewick's birds andquadrupeds again and again had theleaves been turned over and occasion wasoften found by mr and mrs howard torelate some anecdote in illustration of thecharacters of the different animals which areso prettily and so truly depicted by thenewcastle woodengraver to observewas one of the constant lessons which wastaught in the howard family to inquirethe children were told was not always curious we might be asour curiosity could not on all occasionsuses of animals to man be satisfied respect for others and regardfor the variety of men's situations and stationsmade it often incumbent on us torestrain inquiry when it might seem intrusiveor impertinent but to observe wasalways right and proper and observationwas constantly encouraged as was the communicationof what had been observednatural history was one of the most frequentand to the children most agreeabletopics of conversation imagine then thehoward family gathered together as usualafter the tea had been removed from thetable and mr howard having called edithto him and placed her between his kneesthus addressing them we talked some time ago children ofthe services which animals might render toman services voluntary and involuntaryand i remember a circumstance so remarksminor moralsable and so interesting that it will do wellfor our evening taleperhaps you have heard of generalrafael riego he was well known duringthe war of independence in the peninsulaand still better after he and quiroga hadheaded an insurrection of the spanish troops inthe isle de leon and set up against the despotismof ferdinand the seventh a popular representativegovernment i was then a travellerin spain and saw the constitutional monumentserected in many of the towns andcities amidst the acclamations of the peoplein france you know they planted treeswhich they called trees of liberty while inspain they erected stones which were denominatedlapide de la

whichmen almost always are doomed to pass whenstruggling for political change riego perished perished on the scaffold one ofhis aide camps was an irishman namedgeorge matthewesit happened that many englishmen wereengaged in these contests which ended inthe subjugation of freedom and the reestablishmentof despotic power and many ofthese englishmen occupied the prisons ofspain i was called upon to inquire intothe fate of one of them who was believedto be immured in the dungeons of thespanish capital i employed a banker ofsome influence to ascertain whether anyenglishman who corresponded to the descriptioni gave of the party was reallyconfined in any of the jails of madridhe could not be found notwithstanding the minor moralsmost anxious and persevering search of myfriend but while he was engaged inhis investigations a dirty memorandumwas put into his hand by a soldier whowas guarding one of the condemned cells inwhich a human being had been long keptin solitary confinement excluded from allcommunication except such verbal conversationas in opposition to the orders of hissuperior might be charitably entered on bythe soldier stationed at the door of the cellno writing materials no pen ink or paperno means of intercourse with any personbeyond the four walls of the dungeon wereever allowed to the unhappy prisoner thename of the prisoner was unknown to hisguard all he knew was that he had beencaptured with riego and confined in thecell adjacent to that from whence riego hadbeen led out to execution but the soldier haduses of animals to man mentioned to the prisoner that inquiries hadbeen made about an englishman of the nameof harper and the answer had been that nosuch person was within the prisonwallsthe prisoner intreated the soldier to conveythe scrap of paper that he gave him to thegentleman who had been making the inquiries he consented to do so the bankerreceived it and sent it to meit was signed george matthewes itwas scarcely legible but it stated that thewriter had been long in solitary confinementwithout accusation without judgment yetin apprehension of sentence of death andthat he was an englishmanmr canning was then prime ministeri wrote to him immediately and a despatchwas sent off without delay to madrid directingthe british minister to claim the personwho without the forms of legal proceedingq minor moralshad been thus arbitrarily detained the interventionwas successful and the prisonerwas releasedhe accompanied the returning messengerto england he brought with him the funeralmementos of riego the pocket handkerchiefwith which he wiped his last mortal butmanly tears and gave it to his widow poorthing she was then drooping like a lily onits stem fair and pure and the weight ofgrief soon overwhelmed a broken hearty

wrote theaccount that led to his deliverance that wasthe memorandum i received what becameof the dove i know not but georgematthewes died some years afterwards a prisonerin portugali was one day talking with mademoiselleduvaucel niece of the celebrated naturalistcuvier on the tractableness of animals andshe said they had then a curious example ofthe influence of one bird upon anotherthough of wholly different species a vultureand a raven were neighbours in the jardindes plantes the raven was by commonconsent allowed to be the most amiable minor moralsanimal within the gardenwalls and was inconsequencea universal favourite he hadlearnt all sorts of tricks such as catchingbread in the air dancing and flutteringwhen visited by any of his acquaintancesand generally giving evidence of a superiorintelligence he was often oversupplied withfood from the contributions of his friendsand never failed when he had eaten a sufficiencyto bury the rest for future use andnever forgot the place of its concealmentwhether the vulture had perceived or notthat his neighbour raven's reputation wasgreater than his own and the spirit of emulationgrew within him in consequence ofhis observations and reflections could not bepositively ascertained but certain it is thevulture took to imitating the raven andsoon made considerable progress in his fascinatingarts he abandoned animal food anduses of animals to man adopted bread nourishment he was greatlyperplexedhowever by his curved and crookedbill the raven easily picked off the dustfrom the bread or plucked the bread out ofthe dust with his sharp and piercing instrumentand had got into the habit of pokingit about till he found a clean place for itthe vulture's difficulties were at first insurmountable nature had denied him the toolswhich the raven had to work with he succeededhowever at last and after muchtwisting and writhing and inexhaustible patiencewas able to regale himself comfortablywith his newlyadopted foodamong the galley slaves whom i saw departfor toulon on the st april wasone all whose attention was absorbed by alittle creature that ran up and down his armshid itself in his breast played about hisneck and seemed busied in diverting the criedminor moralsfinal from the dark and dreary thoughtswhich must have been rushing through hismind i saw him fully occupied with hisplaything and far more concerned in protectingit from mischief than with any othercare an intruder into his cell he had managedfirst to capture and then to tame itand having no other receptacle for what remainedin him of kindness and benevolenceand i never knew kindness and benevolencewholly eradicated in the most ferocious criminalhe had poured out upon the sleekskinned mouse all that he had of love isaw him full of apprehension lest the poorlittle animal should be injured or crushed inthe crowd as the convicts were led forthone after another and seated in the long linefrom which they are to rise with the heavyiron collar

around him he took nonotice of the spectators and even when thehammer smote the rivet upon the anvil hewas watching the courses of the little creatureand was perhaps contrasting their mutualdestinies

wintry season but where shall retreat and then hesmiled upon the pretty little animal strokedvol ii c minor moralsits back gently and hid it again in his beatingbreast do you know what became of himasked edithno my dear he was probably forgottenwhen i visited the bagnes i was toldthat it was not allowed to the officers tomention the names of the prisoners thepunishment was intended to remove themfrom the world and to break up all theirconnections with their old acquaintancesbut would it do so papa could theybe made to forget everybody and everybodyto forget them the attempt did not always succeededith for i found that love and kindredand other claims brought many people tothe vicinity of the bagnes who tried andsometimes were successful in establishinguses of animals to man communications with the prisoners i heardof an instance where a lady of rank had livedfor many months in the neighbourhood for thepurpose of obtaining the release of a criminalto whom she was attached and she succeededby large and repeated bribes sostrong are the human affections and so illadvisedlyare they sometimes directed butwe must take care not to err by severe judgmentsthere is often much virtue amongcriminals virtue which if it had found timeand place for its proper exercise would havemade them illustrious public benefactorsthose who have never known the pressureof want are often apt to condemn too harshlyif they changed places with the unfortunateit might be found that the scale of meritwould be wholly changed the rich are tooapt to be severe on the errors of the poor minor moralscould they but fancy themselves smittenwith poverty they would be more charitableand being more charitable would be morejust to otherslove of excellence andlove of excellingpapa said george one day to mr howard alien we are endeavouring at schoolto get the highest places in our class i sometimesobserve that the boys who cannot geton are made uncomfortable by the successof those who can so that the good fortuneof some cannot be obtained without givingpain to others ought this to be when i was a boy said mr howardi went to a school in which there waswritten in letters more than a foot long letemulation prevail i was much perplexedby it for it often happened that the boys minor moralswho made the greatest progress annoyed andtormented others so that this very emulationwas often the cause of much vexation andthis led me to consider that there was agreat difference between the love of excellenceand the love of excellingoh said arthur indeed there is becausei have seen boys who got to the headof their class and whom we loved better thanany boys in the schooland i am sure that may well be saidlittle edith because some of the cleverestand wisest people i ever knew were thegentlest and the kindest don't you remembermamma when we were on the sea coasthow pleasant it was to listen to mr harcourtwho was a great philosopher and who knewall about the causes of the rising and fallingof the tides and the different shapes of themoon and the reason of the summer's heatlove of excellence etc and the winter's cold and eclipses and whotold us of all the changes the earth had undergoneand of the rocks that were oldestand those of later date and of the animalsthat lived before the deluge and of thestrange world they must have had to existin and who taught us the causes of lightand darkness and how men breathe the airthat is given out by plants and plants breathethe air that is given out by men and agreat many other wonderful things and yethe never made us feel uncomfortable weloved him for his wisdom and we neverfeared him and his visits were always mostwelcomeoh said arthur that is like our mathematicalfriend who talks to us about anglesand triangles and euclid and wrangling atcambridge and helps us in our algebra difficultiesand in all our sums and cyphers minor moralsand yet never says a single word to provethat he knows more about these matters thanany body else and yet we know he doesbut feel quite as happy in his company as ifhe knew no more than any of usand happier too said edith becausewe can learn so much from his knowledgewhich his good nature makes so verydelightfulthen my dear children said mr howard you will see what is good and what isevil in that word emulation and the differencethere is between love of excellence andthe love of excelling the love of excellencegives no pain to others the love ofexcelling may give pain and when it doesit is unamiable i will tell you a storywhich will show you the differencein the county of devonshire there is anextensive desert which is called a forest beloveof excellence etc ocause in remote times there is no doubt itwas covered with woods it is now surroundedby granite rocks among which manyof those beautiful rivers have their sourcewhose crystal brightness and wanderingcourse through a rich variety of rocky andverdant scenery have often excited the attentionand led to the descriptions of travellerson the verge of dartmoor by theborders of the dart a river rapid as itsname there was a cottage almost hidden inthe rich variety of verdure which the mildand humid climate of devon produces ingreat abundance myrtles were there whichdared every season and were equally greenin the wintery as in the vernal months andin the summer season the blossoms of thepomegranate hung in clusters of vermilionas bright as ever was seen in tropical islandsthe cottage was inhabited by a widow whoc minor moralshad two daughters whose names were janeand emily macdonald they had been bornin india where their father had been engagedfor some years in the service of the east indiacompany with happy prospects before him offuture prosperity he had intended to sendhis children to europe for education for asi dare say you know the climate is dangerousto children of european origin and oftenanticipated the delight with which he shouldwatch their progress and welcome themwhen their education had been completed but death that so often interferes with man'sprojects interfered with mr macdonald's and he was suddenly carried ois by one ofthose reckless and rapid diseases which makelife so shadowy and uncertain in those remoteregions when he died all his brilliantvisions with respect to his childrenfaded away from the mind of their motherlove of excellence etc and she returned to england a sad and solitarywidow with slender means determinedto seek some spot of solitude where shemight devote herself to the education of herdaughters she consulted her friends andfound there was no spot where she couldlive more economically than in the neighbourhoodi have described she had astrong love for the charms of nature andhill and mountain forest and river scenerybrought to her mind the thoughts which sheloved to indulge she could fancy there wasa friendly voice in the echoes of the hillsand that the music of the woodbirds and ofthe waters was meant to soothe her sorrowswhen she went vrith her daughters into thefields and gathered wild flowers it seemedto her as if they were all made to consoleand to comfort her if i had not beenhere she said nobody would have noticed minor moralsthem and it was a pleasant thought thatshe reckoned for something in a part of theworld which without her might have beenneglected and abandonedjane was only one year older than hersister emily jane had a great desire to instructherself but she cared not low muchshe sacrificed others whenever she knewanything she was not only desirous of exhibitingher knowledge but she always wishedto contrast it with the ignorance of her companionsit was not enough for her to putforth on every occasion all she had read andheard but she seemed desirous of talking onsubjects where she could show her superiorityso for instance she was frequentlyblazoning forth that she had been in india had seen the ganges had ridden upon elephants had had fifty black servants so thatnobody was allowed to talk with her of greatlove of excellence etc rivers of great animals and great attendantsand if she had only mentioned this by wayof information instead of as a display ofpride her conversation would have been interestingand instructive but she had a passionatedesire to appear to excel and in orderto do so she never thought how much shehumiliated or distressed others i do not believeshe really meant to give them painbut she was careless about the consequencesof what she said and didemily's character and conduct was verydifferent the ambition to obtain the goodopinion of others was not wanting to hershe had really and truly the love of excellencebut while she was under the influencesof a desire to communicate any informationwhich might be useful or pleasant toher companions and friends she was especiallycareful so to communicate it as to consminor moralsvey no emotions of vexation to them shenever intruded observations which could grievethose who listened to her she was moredesirous of gathering from others the informationthey were able to communicate thanof displaying her own when her sisterspoke people were doubtful whether shemight not say annoying and disagreeablethings but when emily opened her lipseverybody was sure that her words would bewelcome thoughtful and wellchoseni have spoken of the macdonald companionsfor though they lived in a secludedplace there are few places in england sosecluded as to be shut out from that intercoursewhich is both refreshing and consolingthere was in the neighbourhood adissenting clergyman a modest and benevolentman whose visits were hailed with delightwhenever and wherever he appearedlove of excellence etc a newlyarrived neighbour like mrs macdonaldwho had seen so much of the worldwho had inhabited asia touched on africaand brought with her to europe so manytales of wonder gathered in the orientalworld was a settler whose arrival excited nolittle interest in the devonian vales to thisminister she had brought letters and he hadmade it his business to seek friends andacquaintances for mrs macdonald who weremost anxious to show the interest they feltin her wellbeing it was thus a circle ofsocial fellowship was created and here it wasthat jane and emily displayed the peculiaritiesof their characterthe good people of the neighbourhoodwere at first so charmed with jane's vivacitythat they sought all sorts of excuses for thatlittle defect which it was impossible for herto conceal but which they overlooked at first minor moralsout of courtesy to a stranger and becauseshe was really an instructed and intelligentgirl bat alas her defects became moreoffensive from being unchecked and the moretimid but more considerate emily imperceptiblywon upon the kind affections of thelittle social circle her information came inamodest and gentle guise while jane's voicewas frequently loud and her manner intrusivelittle by little those who listenedgrew inattentive from being inattentive theybecame uneasy and at last they venturedto tell miss jane that she should not speakin so peremptory and patronising a mannerall that jane lost in the kind feelings oftheir neighbours emily won for emilythough she often felt that she might havecorrected many ignorant or imperfect notionsof those with whom she conversed felt thatshe could not always do this without giveof excellence etc ing pain but a thousand opportunitiesoccurred in which she was applied to forinformation on matters she had studied andobjects she had seen and all that she saidshe said so gently and so gracefully that noone felt the slightest embarrassment stillless vexation from instruction coming in sounpretending and attractive a shapejane was not unobservant of what passedand said to her sister whom she fondly lovedi see emily that you are listened to withpleasure however much you talk while theyshow impatience when i get possession ofthe conversation tell me tell me like agood sister what this means indeed my dear jane i have sometimesthought that they do not sufficientlyestimate all your good qualities and do notlike to acknowledge how much more youknow than they but minor moralsbut what retorted jane wliy i think answered emily thatsometimes you are a little too much contrastedwith those to whom you speak oh i know what you mean you thinki parade myself not so my love but i fear that thosewho have seen so much less and who knowso much less than you do not always understandyour tone most true most true replied jane ioften detect myself in a louder voice anda loftier manner than is becoming i willtry i will try to mend itmany many years have passed since thisconversation between the two sisters a changein their fortunes brought them forth fromtheir retirement into the busy bustling worldjane has lost all that desire for distinctionwhich could not satisfy itself without becomeof excellence etc ing a grievance to others it was her lother happy lot to be thrown into the societyof those whose information was much greaterthan hers and she had the good sense tosee how idle it was to presume upon acquirementswhich were eclipsed by those of manywho surrounded her she has discovered thatthe exhibition of fancied excellence is somewhatdifferent from the possession of realexcellence she is rather desirous of beingone of many to bring her little tribute ofknowledge to the general stock than to appearthe possessor of an exclusive fund ofknowledge which she knows is not hersemily's fate has been perhaps happierher modesty made her a favourite her informationbrought with it respect in herthe love of excellence was never linked withpersonal parade and as she never sought a placehigher than her deserts but always lower minor moralseverybody was desirous of honouring her byelevation how many pains she saved toherself how many pleasures she created forherself nobody but herself can know butsure i am that if you my children strive tobe excellent not from a desire of loweringothers but of raising yourselves if youremulation have in it no illwill no enmity if in the honourable race you run the desireto obtain the prize is not polluted bythoughts of enmity to those who run therace with you your winning will be honourableand honourable will be your failures'slaveryamong the visitors who frequently called onmr howard's family was a gentleman whohad been a great traveller both by land andsea having visited the four quarters of theglobe he often delighted the children bythe tales he told of the countries he haddwelt in and the sights he had seen thechildren called him governor for he had beengovernor of one of the english settlementson the african coast and whether it wasthat he had seen so much injustice alone tothe blacks as to lead him to suppose that onevery occasion when there was any misunderstandingwith white men the white men minor moralswere invariably wrong and the black menright or whether he had a sort of instinctivepreference for the ebony race i know notbut his friends were accustomed to say andto say truly that he was sure to decideevery question in favour of the negro andthat the white man lost all his fair chanceswhen our governor was judge between themhe was a rare exception indeed to whitemen in general for in a great part of theworld the negro is looked upon as a fair andfit object for oppression and misdoing hislife his little property his wife his childrenare too often considered as at the disposal ofsome white tyrant who has obtained possessionof himin mr howard's family the fate of thepoor negroes was often a subject of conversationand the children were in the habit ofinducing the governor to tell them anecdotesslavery of the woollyheaded natives of africa whomhe knew better than most men and of whomhe always spoke with the feelings of a friendand sometimes even with the affection of abrotherone evening the favourite topic was introducedand the governor said he would tellthem a little story he had heard from thelips of a french captain engaged in theafrican trade assuring them that he believedevery word to be strictly trueands said the governor you mustfancy me to be the french captain becausei can better convey to you the history if ispeak in his name and person and this iswhat the french captain said i was coasting near cape palma wheni observed on the shore some of thosewooden huts which europeans are wonthastily to construct upon the burning sand minor moralsthese cabins are fragile and of short durationbut serve as market places for thosebargains in human beings which form themost lucrative commerce carried on in theafrican tropics a large brig painted blackwas anchored close to the shore

stealth to fillup her cargo of misery with which to departto other markets where white men wouldbe found to buy those unfortunate beingswhom in africa black men kidnapped andwhite men encouraged them to do soa young man met me when i landed he came out from one of the huts clothed orrather half clothed in that careless and slovenlymanner which is very common in hotslavery climates where no eye of fashionable observationwatches the proprieties of dress heapproached me with a careless air and in alounging and somewhat scornful gait hehad much of that cunning distrustful lookwhich distinguishes those who are engagedin illicit transactions and which is as itwere the last expression of the sense ofshame for the cases are few observed thegovernor in which men occupied in misdeedsfail to betray a sense of their disgracefulemployment and i have often seenadded he the expression of selfcondemnationeven where success and splendid fortunes hadappeared to recompense nefarious transactionshow astonished i was said the captainwhen after looking keenly at me for a fewminutes the negrodealer rushed into myvol ii d minor moralsarms and is it possible he said thatyou are come to this abominable

one with a similar meaningis not to be found in any language but english for that is what i have heard said papa no my boy answered mr howardboth the word and the thing are to be foundin many other languages and several of themhave even a name for that passionate longingfor home which sometimes accompanies theabsent and which may be translated homeachedo you think the love of home is equallystrong among all nations certainly not nor is it to be wished that minor moralsit should be so i have known many peoplemade unhappy by it and sometimes the prejudicein favour of a particular

him as the alpine mountains to the swisspeasant or the green plains to the frieslandor the vast forest to the american savagetrue replied mr howard and thesubject brings one or two little circumstanceswhich you shall hear to my memorythere is a rich and lovely mountain situatedlove of home close to the town of ay which is distinguishedfor the exquisite champagne wine it producesit was once an arid and useless surface bringingforth nothing but a few coarse weeds such asachalky rock and a scant and sandy surfacewould allow to grow but in progress of timethis hill was found singularly adapted to thecultivation of the most luscious grapes and ithas obtained a value equalled perhaps by noother landed property in europe the wholebosom of the mountain has been turned to theproduction of the vine and it now bears thecharacter of one vast garden divided and subdividedinto numerous plots of ground manyof which are scarcely larger than a large and these again are subdividedamong the children as the parents die thefrench law requiring that all property shallbe equally partitioned without any referenceto sex or to earlier or later birth minor moralsi have visited this elevated district and wasmuch struck with its charming appearanceit overlooks the village of ay and the rivermarne runs slowly and sluggishly through thevalley below close by the town of eternalwhose vaults in which the champagne wine istreasured have obtained a great reputationas indeed they well deserve for some of themwill hold more than a million of bottles andwith their sections and intersections are abovea mile in length mr howard described thecare and caution with which the champagnewine is brought to its marketable shape andthe children where pleased to hear a fact veryhonourable to the workpeople employed thatthough this attractive and intoxicating beveragewas constantly accessible to them in any quantityan instance of drunkenness had scarcelyever occurred it is not therefore the presenceof intoxicating beverages which necessarilylove of home leads to excess but other causes which maybefound perhaps in the habits of the peoplethe vineyards on the mountain side areaswas mentioned of extraordinary value particularlythose which lie between the summitand the valley that is to say the line whichis to be traced along the middle of the hillwhere the sun shines with all its brightness and where neither the winds which blow overthe higher nor the humidity of the lowerregions interfere with the rich products of thevintage season four or five hundred poundssterling per acre is not an uncommon priceto pay for this privileged tract of land itis wholly in the hands of small proprietors scarcely one possessing even to the amountof an acre and most not a half a quarteror even a tenth of an acre it is almostintirely cultivated by the hands of its owners and the attachment shown to the soil the minor moralseagerness with which each one seeks to extendhis little possessions the unwillingness ofchildren to consent to any arrangement butthe subdivision however small of the land oftheir fathers are among the striking circumstanceswhich excited mr howard's attentionto the desire of adding something more totheir landed property almost all the distress ofthe district may be traced no sooner has thepeasant amassed a small sum of money by afavourable vintage than he immediately setsabout buying new vineyards he is frequentlyembarrassed for want of capital but rather thanget rid of any inch of land he has acquiredhe borrows money at enormous interest whichhe has the greatest difficulty in repaying andhence is frequently embarrassed not only bythe claims of the lender but by the wantof capital to carry on the necessary laboursof his little possessions this want of capitallove of home however is no check to imprudent adventuresthough upon the whole the vinegrowing peasantsof champagne must be considered asahappy raceduring the reign of the emperor napoleonthe conscription played sad havoc with thepeaceful peasantry of champagne torn awayfrom their native vineyards to carry on warsin which they had no concern sad were thescenes of their separation and many were thecurses they flung at those who dragged themfrom their homes but soon the general feelingmastered their local attachments and thechampenois became as enthusiastic in

vicissitudes who had helpedto win his battles and who had shared hisdefeats now occupied with laborious industry inthe cultivation of a small spot of vineyard landwhich he had inherited from his

their own coulddestroy in the minds of the champenois ofseven conscripts who had accompanied buonapartein his wars only one had perished andsix had returned to their native cottages oneof the six was blind and the other five wereengaged in cultivating with their own handsthe vineyards from which they had been separatedfor so many yearsi walked with one of the vignerons alongthat part of the hill

be seennot a vine which was not as much cared foras if the owner had but one vine in the worldthat there were no white grapes in thewhole plot as you know said he the bestwhite wine is always made from the blackgrape he talked of his neighbours whoconsented to deteriorate their wine by a manurewhich he owned greatly increased thequantity but damaged the quality and blamedthem severely for sacrificing their reputationto gain he talked of his champagne as ifall the world knew its excellence and of hislittle vine garden which i could have crossedwith a hopskipandajump as if it were ofimportance and interest to the whole race ofman he pointed out to me a spot biggerthan his own belonging to a wealthy neighbourand seemed to think that neighbourbound to be the most blessed of mankindlove of home and yet i doubt if the vigneron had tastedhis own wine twice in his life if he had itwas probably in the house of the merchantwho purchased his grapes it being the customof those who are really the makers of anddealers in wine to have the juice extracted bytheir own impressesi remember hearing you say papa saidgeorge that you had seen the same attachmentshown by the weaver of lyons to hisloom as you say is shown by the champagnepeasant to his vineyard yes i have renown instances where theloom has been treated like a pet child calledby tender names ornamented with

the most active lad ofthe small town in which he was born whensent on an errand nobody ran so fast as he nobody rose earlier in the morning nobodywashed and dressed more expeditiously nobodywas more regular at school more sharpat his lessons or more ready and active atplay everybody liked tom who was briskas a bee and playful as a grasshopper hiswhistle was well known in the streets andhis hands were always ready to do service tootherstom was the only child of an aged mavolii f minor moralsriver a pensioner whose pittance just enabledhimself to live in decency and tom wasthe son of his old age for he had married atthe end of a long service and the boy was bornto him when he had passed sixty years youmay believe he was proud and fond of tomwhich indeed he was and having little elseto do his time was almost wholly devoted tothe boy he rocked him in his cradle whetherhe lay down at morning noon or night carried him about in his arms almost whereverhe went as soon as the boy ran alonethe old mariner seemed to grow young againso did he share in all the boy's sports andpleasure he taught him to play at marblesto trundle a hoop to follow my leader in aword the father was the son's playfellow andthey were a very happy pairthe first time tom had ever known realsorrow was when his mother died he wascommerce then six years old and her death was thelast real sorrow that the old mariner knewtom's mother had always been an affectionatemother and did not like her husband the lessfor all the care and attention he bestowed ontheir only son she told him often that he wouldspoil the boy but said so between jest andearnest but the old mariner's indulgenceswere not of a sort to do tom any harmon her deathbed however she said to herhusband you will always be kind to tom and to tom she said you will always bekind to your father she did not speak toeither as if she doubted or as if she meant togive them lessons which really they did notneed but she spoke as if foretelling thatthey would be kind to each otherthe living and the dying of the poor isfor the most part a short and simple historyduties to the poor as to others come daily to minor moralsbe done and are as honourable to the poorwho do them as the more influential virtuesof the opulent are honourable to the opulentthrough the years in which tom'smother had managed her little household shehad managed it well and prudently andwhen death removed her from her husbandand her child many there were to praiseand none to blame her and no one canaspire to a higher privilege among survivorstian this to be thought of with nothing butaffectionthere was some danger indeed that thedeath of his mother might have a baneful influenceupon tom in whom all his father'scares and thoughts were now centred andwho was little disposed to check any of hisson's impulses but tom had been gifted bynature with a happy temper and he didnot give way to unavailing grief such griefcommerce would not have brought back his mother andhave only distressed his father so the tearshe shed were soon dried not that he forgothis mother not that he failed to think ofher and to remember her kindness to him andher affection for him but he thought that sheherself would not have wished him to be lessbusy less useful than before so he indulgedhimself in the habit of talking about his motherand though at first the

otherwise have forgotten andthe recollection was a delight to him throughthe remainder of his lifeone day the old mariner said to tomi am unusually out of spirits i havebeen thinking my boy of what your future minor moralsfate may be and that it is time for youto be thinking about it too for i am growingold and fear i shall not last long andi shall not die in peace unless i know thatyou have some business and some prospectsin lifenow tom had himself often thought ofthis for he was nearly twelve years old butdid not like to speak to his father lest heshould give him pain by appearing desirous ofleaving one he loved so well but as hisfather now mentioned the matter tom saidfather i am glad you have spoken of thisif i knew your wishes perhaps i might bedoing something to fit myself for some honesttradethe old man hoped tom would havehinted at some line of life that he preferredand tom wished that his father should speakout their thoughts and wishes were incommerce deed the same but each feared to suggestwhat might be unacceptable to the other when you were at sea said tom didyou ever carry on any trade with the nativesof foreign countries the inquiry showed thebent of tom's mind and the old mariner answered oh yes my boy and have turnedmany an honest penny in that way shouldyou like to go to sea tom indeed shouldi if i could establish a little business with thenatives of distant countriesafter this the subject was often talkedof and the old man told tom how barter wasconducted with people of various lands hetaught him too all he knew of the art ofnavigation explained to him as far as hewas able the trade winds and the ocean currentsand the equinoctial gales he loved torecount the dangers he had seen and the riskshe had run he spoke of the different moneysused in different countries and taught tom minor moralsmany a foreign word wmcli lie had pickedup when abroad tom listened with greatattention and stored in his mind everythingthat was likely to be useful and his father'sconversation became more and more interestingas it became more and more instructivesometimes indeed the old man feltthat by these conversations he was preparingtom for his early departure and even whentom was most excited by an account of theway in which when a young sailor he hadexchanged with a naked negro a string ofbeads for a noisy parrot the old man suddenlystopped he thought of dangerous climatesand the shipmates he had buried on theafrican coast he stopped suddenly and toldtom that he would end the story some otherday a short time after this while tom was readingto his father from the bible as he was usedto do the old man's face grew pale and he felljc crojccommerce back in his chair tom fanned his cheeks withthe book he held in his hand and after a fewminutes his father was able to say faintly andfeebly to bed tom to bed tom helpedhim in ran to the neighbours for help butsoon perceived by their countenances thatmatters were in a sad way and so indeedthey were the old mariner became speechless once he stretched his hand to tom tomseized it and kissed it in a few hours themariner was dead in a few days his bodywas laid in the churchyard by the side of hiswife and a small white gravestone was raisedover it on which tom had roughly engravedwith his own hands the initials of his father'sand his mother's nametom had many friends they came andoffered their services and would have kept himamong them but tom's thoughts were wanderingthrough the wide world the neighed minor moralshours bought the little furniture at its valuefor tom told them he had determined to seekhis fortune afar off about eight or nine poundshe received for the small possessions of hisparents he said to himself i hope the peoplewill not forget me if i should come back again i have nothing now left me to care for thewind may blow from the quarter it will allports are alike to me tom paid one visitto his parents grave it was then he took leaveof the place of his birthhe went to liverpool and lost no time ininquiring out a respectable shipbroker towhom he told his short but simple story itwas his good luck to fall in with a kindheartedand clever man who said he would give him aberth on a vessel bound for the coast of africatom remembered how suddenly his father hadstopped when telling him of his own africanadventures but tom was not superstitious thecommerce climate he said he did not fear the bargain wasmade tom felt as if his life and history werenow begun and as the kind shipbroker hadoffered to assist him in investing his littlecapital tom fancied himself the luckiest ashewas then one of the proudest of mortalson the voyage tom obtained the goodopinion of the captain and the confidence ofall the crew the adventure was successfuland when he arrived in england he haddoubled his wealth he had got experiencetoo and as the vessel was to return to africatom's observations were of great value to theshipbroker and to the owners to whom thecaptain had reported the cleverness and activityof young tomtom remained on board the vessel duringthree voyages he was now nearly nineteenyears old and his fortune was accumulated tosomewhat more than a favourite with minor moralseverybody because willing to be a friend toeverybody there was nobody on board whosegood fortune was witnessed with so much pleasureon returning from the third voyage thecaptain told tom that the owner had beentalking of him that he desired to see him andhe believed would make to him an agreeablecommunication tom went it was at the timewhen the supplies of timber were checked bythe war and the merchant after many inquiriesabout tom's success reminded him that he hadonce spoken of the vast forests on the shores ofthe african rivers and expressed an opinionthat the negroes might be induced to fell thetrees and barter them with europeans theidea has often occurred again to my mindsaid the merchant and if you still think sowe will make the experiment we will findships and capital and you shall have an interestin it in truth it was a favourite project ofcommerce tom's he was delighted to see it adoptedand soon after a vessel was fitted out of whichtom had the charge he sailed for africa and i have often heardtom describe the toil and trouble which it costhim to teach the africans how best to fell andsaw the trees and bring them to the river'sedge but tom succeeded and the speculationsucceeded at first only a few stragglingblacks came to cut down the forest trees butas they were liberally recompensed they afterwardscame in great numbers and built theirhuts in the neighbourhood of the place wheretom fixed his own habitation and where hedwelt for many years the trade became avery large one and tom dwelt like a princesurrounded by his subjects he

conversationsbetween the golden fishes i heard the tramplingof horses the drums and trumpets wereapproaching and the sight of ten or fifteenthousand troops filled my mind with far differentthoughts from those with which i hadbeen occupiedwarthe troops were escorting the king to thechamber of deputies i followed them thitherand sat in the tribune listening to the debatesi heard an orator eulogize one of his countrymenby saying his was the noble baptismof blood the words were received withunqualified admiration the sentiment and thephrase seemed equally acceptable to the representativesof francebaptism of blood what a thrilling expression said edithand to call it noble too what an idearesponded arthur minor moralsand to think added george that a largeassembly should not only not disapprove butshow signs of satisfaction but notwithstanding my children i youmust not be too hasty in judging anothernation words have frequently a meaningwhich is not rendered by translation in themind of the orator there was perhaps no otherthought than that with which hundreds of thousandsof englishmen would speak of trafalgaror waterloo the ideas of glory and victorythe exhibitions of power absorb the mind andthrow all the misery and crime and follywhich accompany war into the shade thusit is that if we employed words more fittingthe occasion we should sooner reform opinionbut the mischief is wide and deep which growsout of improperly chosen wordsrespect for human life is one of the greatestevidences of improvement and civilizationwar death is really a solemn thing because it isthe destruction of all those pleasures and painsof which the living are susceptible if it bevicious to inflict unnecessary suffering or toprevent possible enjoyment the extinction ofall the sources of suffering and enjoyment byviolence must when unjustifiable be theheaviest of all offences war would be impossibleif the value and the sacredness of lifewhere fitly estimated it would be found that ajustification for such a sacrifice as war bringswith it is really and in the nature of thingsalmost impossible that until every conceivablemeans of discussion debate inquiry forbearancegenerosity had been wholly exhausteduntil no shadow of a chance remained for peacefuland pacific arrangement no excuse couldbe sufficient for venturing upon the vast oceanof miseries which national hostility createsstrolling over the scenes of the late riots minor moralsof paris i tarried before the house in the ruetransnonain where many persons had beenkilled and i was curious to hear the observationsof the people who were gatheredin groups recounting to one another thehorrors of the day i observed that theobservation most general among them wasthat french blood had been shed manysaid if it had only been the blood offoreigners i was struck with the minglingof nationality and philanthropy philanthropywhich had abundant sympathy for the sufferingsof the people to which it belonged but whichseemed anxious to exclude every body elsefrom its benevolence and i thought againas i had often thought before on the wretchededucation which nations receive how the fieldof brotherhood is narrowed how all sentimentsof beneficence are chilled and contracted bythe influences of war war nations that are accustomed to hold life inlittle value and who employ barbarous punishmentsas a means of terror are invariably addictedto cruelty in china for exampleinfanticide is not considered a crime and murderin all its forms is of habitual and constantoccurrence yet there is no country thatemploys such a variety of tortures as instrumentsof legislation there are volumes uponvolumes which represent the penal inflictions ofthe chinese laws and ingenuity itself seemsalmost exhausted in the countless shapes ofmisery which men have thus invented for subjectingothers to agony a friend of minewho in a voyage round the world landed at achinese town in the yellow sea told me thathe had witnessed the punishment of a parricidewho eighteen years before had destroyed hisfather and the exhibition he saw was theseventeenth to which the murderer had been minor moralsexposed his sentence condemned him tosolitary confinement to nakedness to the deprivationof light his food was let down froma hole through the top of the cell where he wasimmured and his hair beard and nails wereleft to grow on the anniversary of the murderhe was dragged forth a horrible objectand exposed for a day in a barrel of blood ona public stage he was compelled to feed himselfwith rice drenched in the blood which waforced into his throat by the executioner ifhe refused to eat seventeen times he hadundergone the punishment and there wasscarcely left about him a single fragment ofhumanity this was horrible enough but theeffect was far different from that which was nodoubt intended by the legislature the extravaganceof the suffering had merely gratifiedthe sufferer while the effect upon the spectatorswas by no means salutarywar how impossible would such inflictions becomeif men had any sentiment of the valueof pain and pleasure if they weighed themin the balance as being worthy of theiranxiety if they determined to waste noneof them but to employ them to some goodend i tell you the story children as iheard it as a striking example of illjudgedpunishment happy for you happy for usto have been born

could form an idea ofall the sufferings created by longenduringhostilities i have passed through villagesalmost wholly deserted so deserted that noliving being was to be seen but some poorg minor

everychamber abandoned and desolate i entered st sebastian after the siegeyou know how long and obstinate was theresistance of the garrison it was taken bystormand i followed the conquering armythe road by which they entered was strewedwith dead there was a stream flowing atthe bottom of the citadel and it was almoststopped by mutilated corpses but whenwe reached the breach the sight was horrible shattered limbs broken muskets slices ofhuman flesh fragments of garments werespread about in horrible confusion we enteredthe town it had been set on fire bythe infuriated combatants we saw

was a sceneof revelry and horror of drunkenness anddeath of noise and fearful silence of ferocityand fear of madness and of misery iwas sick and weary of scenes which i havesince heard honoured as glorious but afterthe first frenzy was over when the eyelooked round on the ruin and the devastation nobody would venture to talk of theglory of so frightful a catastrophe thetale of mischief the story of destructioni made my way to the house of a respectablegoldsmith in the town the soldieryhad broken into it they met themother of the family at the top of the stairand brutally knocked her

one who has never dreamedof the price paid for that delusion whichwar is called victory i am sure the feelings ofdelight would soon be changed into those ofdisgust and instead of turning with granulationto the history of destruction the eyewould be offended and the heart woundedby the contemplation of so much frenzy andso much crimeone day remembering what i had seeni wrote the following

many sufferings forwhich there is no relief is it right mammato accustom ourselves to look at pain andsorrow is it most likely to harden the heartor to improve it my love the state which is most likelyto lead to proper and to virtuous conduct isthat where the desire to be useful is not interferedwith by a susceptibility which deprivesus of the power of active exertion minor moralssome people are so sensitive that they losethe very means of doing good others socareless that the disposition to do good isalmost extinguished one defect is nearly asbad as the other but there is more miserycaused by that foolish agitation which makesa person helpless than even by the hardheartednesswhich turns away with indifferencethey are alike useless to the sufferer but in the case of the oversensitive theirown misery is to be added fidgety peopleare very mischievous they make matters worseto others and are a perpetual annoyance tothemselvesi have known persons who as if they hadnot real annoyances enough were always onthe lookout for vexations and grievances attributingall events to the most unfavourableand irritating cause if an answer does notcome to a letter it is sheer neglect if asense and sensitiveness visit is not returned it is an intended slightif an observation is made it is to preventthem from speaking if a person is silentit is because he has no regard for them if ajoke is uttered it is construed into a matterof grave offence and if serious words arespoken they are not intended to be sincereand now i will give you two charactersand you shall choose which you like for yourmodel an old lady whose delight and habitit was to make everything sweet and an oldgentleman the business of whose life it wasto turn everything sourthey lived in the same village its namewas briony the gentleman was mr thaddeustarte the lady was mrs margaretmanna they were as unlike one another asthey could well be but being the principalpeople of briony they often met and asmrs manna was the only person whom mr minor moralstarte never succeeded in driving into a passionshe was frequently favoured with hisvisits he had such a love for wranglingand jarring that he was sometimes in a ragebecause he could not make mrs manna angryhe often stormed against this person and theother and was vexed and waspish becausemrs manna would not agree with him hesometimes said he would never go to herhouse again for that she cared nothing abouthis opinions and would not blame the mostblameable things but mrs manna was singularlyindulgent to mr tarte with othersshe would be sprightly and sportive becauseshe knew they could bear it and would notmisunderstand it she never made experimentson mr tarte's illtemper she put adouble check upon every expression whenmr tarte was at hand i do not mean tosay that mr tarte had or could have all thesense and sensitiveness benefit which the conversation of an amiableand instructed woman would have conveyedhad he allowed her spirits and friendly habitsfull play and had she not perceived howeagerly he sought every occasion to misconstruethe meanings of other people it ispossible to tolerate it is possible to disarmthe illnatured but it is not easy to love themthey must pay the penalty of their disagreeablenessbut because they are disagreeablewe have no right to be uncourteous or uncivilit was a wet and windy day in april whenmr tarte put on his great coat took hisstick in his hand and went forth to make amorning call on mrs manna the weatherwhich was a little like the temper ofhis mind cold stormy and gloomy had puthim particularly out of humour and so off hewent to vent his spite upon his goodnaturedneighbour a pretty intrusion you will say minor moralsand so indeed it was which nothing but theexcellent temper of mrs manna would havemade tolerablehe knocked at the door as the servant didnot immediately open it new fuel was addedto his discontent he knocked violently a secondtime the servant came running to lethim in i beg your pardon sir but i wasin a distant part of the house when i heardyour first knock allow me to take your coatinto the kitchen to dry yes said mrtarte you were attending to anythingbut your business a pretty thing to keeppeople drenched and drowning in the streeti shall mention your inattention to your mistressthere and so saying mr thaddeustarte threw his coat on the balustradewithout paying any attention to the man'scivility and followed him into the cravingsense and sensitiveness mrs manna was then turning over theleaves of an annual obviously much delightedwith the succession of beautiful engravingswhich she found in it madam said mr tarte good morningsir responded mrs manna madam repeated mr tarte very stiffly i told yourservant i should mention his incivility it ishigh time that such carelessness should benoticed i hope madam in charity to yourvisitors you will require your man to be alittle more on the alert i hope saidmrs manna thomas has not been wantingin civility towards you he is generallyso very attentive yes madam so civiland attentive as to leave me to be soakedthrough and through by this abominablerain knocking knocking and not able toget in i am sure thomas could not have in minor moralstended it intended it or not said mrtarte so it was but in truth repliedmrs manna the fault is mine i sent himto the garret and forgot to desire one ofthe women to attend to the door whatdetestable weather exclaimed mr tartebut seasonable and useful responded mrsmanna no madam such disagreeable andviolent storms are never seasonable i seeno reason in the world why if we are tohave rain it should come overwhelming uslike a deluge mrs manna was about toanswer with some animadversion for to hermind nothing was a more irresistible evidenceof the foresight and the benevolenceof the divine being than the orderly andregular distribution of the seasons to eachits task of good is committed by each inturn is it fulfilled thus to the humid springbelongs the calling forth the buds and thesense and sensitiveness flowers and the fruits to summer andautumn and mrs manna lead been justthinking of the beneficial influences of stormsand showers when any remarks were madein her presence which seemed to impugn thekindness or the wisdom of providence hermind received a painful shock yet she feltthis did not warrant her being out of humour so she made no answer whatever tomr tarte's observation thinking some fitteroccasion might occur for communicating heropinions she introduced other subjects therewere one or two on which mr tarte liked todilate he was fond of fishing and lovedto talk of his fishing exploits and in thecourse of the conversation he dropped theword that this fall of rain would induce himto go out angling on the morrow mrs mannasmiled as he spoke and mr tarte who washalf disposed to take the smile amiss behaved minor moralsprudently for once and even said thankyou to thomas as he brought him his greatcoatwarm from the kitchen fire and putinto his hands the umbrella neatly foldedand dried the rain was over above thevillage church a rainbow hung one end ofwhich was lost in the blue heaven thesloping street of the village had been washedclean by the storm and mr tarte as heruminated upon the sport of the next dayrecollected too with how much discontenthe had spoken of the deluge and its disagreeablealas all these impressions weretransitory mr tarte had the habit of discontent and a most melancholy habit it ismy children another day it was at the end of thesummer season when the trees begin to puton their brown garments and to shake offtheir leaves mrs manna was walking bysense and sensitiveness the side of a stream that ran close to thevillage and she discovered mr tarte seatedupon a bank with his shirtfrill ruffled hishat off his gloves and stick at some distancefrom him and looking more than usually discomposedher first impression was to turnback and not subject herself to be annoyedby his peevishness but on second thoughtsshe determined to accost him because as hehad probably seen her approach he mightbe offended by her sudden retreat and as itwas her general habit to walk by the bankwhere mr tarte was now exhibiting his illhumourmr tarte would be more likely tonotice her conduct so she advanced with aquiet step and taking no notice whatever ofmr tarte's embarrassment said she hadbeen delighted with her evening's walkso have not i with mine madam respondedmr tarte stretching out one handvol ii h minor moralsto gather np his stick and gloves while withthe other he buttoned up his waistcoat andthen took a handkerchief from his pocketand wiped his forehead dry mrs mannawaited to hear of some terrible grievance andfound that the amount of the mischief wasmerely this that mr tarte had stumbledover a stone and fell but he said he couldhave borne this it was a common accidenthad he not reason to believe that the wholewas a plot of some mischievous boys to annoyhim for when he was on the groundhe heard some young scoundrels cry outwell done old taddy tarte and theyburst into loud laughter and clapped theirhands with delight the subject of mrtarte's meditations while on the bank washow he could revenge himself on the boys hefirst thought of following them and punishingthem with a hearty drubbing but he foundsense and sensitiveness they could run faster than he then he wouldgo to the village school and obtain for thema handsome flogging from the master but asfar as he could distinguish them they did notbelong to the school what was to be done for punished they should bethe truth was that mr tarte who wascalled old taddy tarte by all the young peopleof the village was an object of no little dislikehe was so much in the habit of interferingwith the sports and checking the enjoymentsof the children he was so spare in his praisesso severe in his animadversions that theywere always rather pleased when anythingwith him went wrong if his hen roost wererobbed well tis a good thing twas oldtaddy sj they said if his chimney were onfire better old taddy's than mrs manna's'was the exclamation once when returninghome late his foot slipped and he rolled minor moralsinto the gutter and reached his house coveredwith mud the accident was a subject ofuniversal mirth and i am afraid of almostuniversal satisfactionbut was this right asked edith who wasalso desirous of learning what duty requiredand who was far too kind and generous torejoice in any human being's misfortuneoh no love it was very wrong but itwas inevitable restrain our own feelings aswe may there will be always too many in theworld to feel pleasure in the misfortunes ofthose whom they dislike and if there wereno other and better means of checking the evildispositions of others it would be right to usethese means but a sufficient reason againstusing them is that they are not the best meanshowever mr taddy had mistaken the matter the boys had really nothing to do withthe accident the stone had not been put insense and sensitiveness the middle of the road by them it had fallenaccidentally out of a pavior's cart and the wholeamount of the blame due to the boys was theirhaving laughed at old taddynow mrs manna was just as much anobject of affection in the village as mr tartewas of dislike every body from youngestto eldest was delighted to do her a serviceit was the natural consequence of her constanthabit of doing services to othersshe endeavoured but in vain to pacifymr tarte he was determined that he wouldnot be induced to consider the whole affair asanything but a premeditated insult at firstand a wicked mockery afterwards mrs mannafound there was no use in arguing against aman whom nothing could convince she didnot however utter an angry word but continuedher walk by the banks of the streamas she walked a dog sprung out of a minor moralsfarmyard and ran towards her barking as ifit meant to bite her two boys followed thedog one of them seized him by the collarand the other said it is not old taddy tartehe must not hurt the lady mrs mannalooked the urchin in the face who said to herlaughingly it shan't touch you madam wethought old taddy was coming this way andwe meant to frighten him and whysaid mrs manna oh ma'am he is suchan illnatured old fellow we were comingalong the road and saw him fall over a stoneand we could not help laughing he was insuch a passion and then he began to abuseus and said we had put the stone there forthe very purpose of throwing him down

for we would not tell you anythingbut the truth but you would please me much bettersaid mrs manna if you would behave differentlyto old mr tarte you should not havelaughed at him because he had the misfortuneto fall but rather have offered to be of anyuse to him and if you had done so kindly hewould certainly not have thought that youwere the cause of the accident and you wouldnot have required a lesson from me you knowshe said with a smilea lady's smile has a great charm in it and if ladies knew how to use their smilesprudently and benevolently i do not knowwhat wonders edith might not be

shouting we shan't forget we shan't forget it was not very long after that mr tartewas walking through the village and hefancied he recognized one of the boys whohad been laughing at him he determinednot to appear to notice the boy thinking thatif he were the guilty person he would againmisbehave himself and mr tarte had madeup his mind to learn who the boy was and toget his father or his master to punish himthe boy was one of the two to whom mrsmanna had spoken a warmhearted anda generous boy and a brave one too theboy expected that mr tarte would notice him he thought even that he should get a blowover his shoulders from mr tarte's cane butas mr tarte passed the boy made a bowthis astonished mr tarte who said to himsense and sensitiveness was it not you who behaved so ill to methe other day was it not you who laughedat me when i fell yes sir said the boyand i wish i had not done so whymy good boy said mr tarte who was muchstruck with the manly frankness of the ladwhy sir because i do not believe you areso illnatured as i thought and besides mrsmanna desired i would not vex you and iwon't vex you again if you'll not be angrywith me for doing so before not i saidmr tarte give me your hand my boyand i think i have learnt a lesson as well asyouthe habit had been too long indulged bymr tarte to enable him to get completelyri of his querulous disposition but it wasmoderated and soon after his conversation withthe boy he called on mrs mannathomas came to the door and was not ah minor moralslittle surprised to hear the very gracious tonesin which mr tarte addressed him it wasa new thing indeed for mr tarte to speak toany servant dth courtesy not that mr tartereally desired to show his scorn or pride orill humour but a certain severity of mannerhad become almost a part of his nature andvery very difficult it was to restrain it did he learn to restrain it mammaasked edithnot wholly edith for as i mentionedhis temper would frequently get the betterof his intentions but he found it was quitefor his interest to check himself and he oftenhad to do sodid mrs manna ever compliment himon his improvement mammanever dear by any direct observationupon it as that might have hurt his selflovebut mr tarte was not insensible that mrssense and sensitiveness manna had perceived a change his visitswere more frequent and they were

profitablesome of them are delicious others dangerousto eat some pleasing to the palateand others absolutely poisonousi have seen a pretty book written by afrench author m rogues in which he scribes a great variety of mushrooms andinstructs his readers to distinguish the wholesomefrom the deleterioushe shows for the use of the poor in timesof famine or when the price of food is verydearthat large

had obtainedfrom their lord the permission to gathermushrooms and to take them to the ochotnoiiliad which is the great market of the russiancapital obtained from their lord inquirededith what does that mean in russia said mr howard thereare many millions of serfs or peasants whoare considered the property of their feudalmushroomhunting master they cannot indeed be removedfrom the soil on which they were born butthey are sold as the trees or the cattle therethey cannot possess property and eventheir little gains are not their own but mayat any time be taken possession of by theirlords those lords are sometimes humaneenough to allow them to get money by theirindustry and there are among them somewho make it their pride and boast that theypossess slaves whom they can call opulentbut now to our story the busiest and the cleverest of theserf family was a young girl called she had learnt little for it is veryseldom that learning enters the logbuilt cottagesof the russian peasants but naturehad given her an active mind and she hadalways taken a sort of pleasure in mushroomgatheringwhen very young she used to minor moralsrequest her father to put her into the talegaor little cart in which he carried his mushroomsto the ochotnoi read and amused herselfoften for which she sometimes got wellscolded in separating the different sorts ofmushrooms more carefully than her fatherhad been used to doone day in coming home from themarket her father said that he had sold hismushrooms more easily and the price heasked was more willingly paid than usualfor i should tell you my children that thereprevails throughout russia the foolish and insincerehabit of asking a price much abovethat which it is intended to take i haveoften known the russians abate half or twothirdsof what they have demandeddo you think anything is got papa said george by this customno george but much is lost by itmushroomhunting time patience and what is far worse ahabit of sincerity i fear there are fewbargains made in russia about which manylies are not told lies to induce the purchaserto give a price beyond the value of thearticle mashenka to proceed with our story saidshe verily believed the reason of her father'ssuccess consisted in the trouble she had takenand asked leave to assort the mushrooms infuture as she gathered them the old mansmiled and stroked his beard for all the russianswear beards and said kharasho whichmeans in english it is well or so be itthis gladdened mashenka and she beganto apply herself with great attention to theseparation of the mushrooms into differentsorts and as her father really found muchprofit in her knowledge he gave her a copeckor two and she was encouraged to be minor moralsthoughtful and careful by the success of herthoughts and caresmashenka had never been taught by thelessons of others but experience led her tomake many important distinctions she foundthat the mushrooms which grew under theshadow of the birchtree were different fromthose she found in the pinewoods that somespecies loved the sun and some the shade and that various soils produced mushroomsalmost as various she made her little experimentsshe transferred the mould from onespot to another she learnt to distinguish bythe taste between the wholesome and the deleterioussorts of mushrooms the russianscall the funguses which grow on trees andwhich they do not eat gribi and the mushroomswhich grow in the ground gull made many experiments on the way ofdressing the various qualities and at lastmushroomhunting her father allowed her to have a little standin the ochottioi read

great andtoo common vices of the russian nobility hewas a reckless gambler he had seen all thevicissitudes between great and moderate opulence he had in fact more than once lost minor moralseverything but his estate and more thanonce added enormously though only for ashort time to his possessions he had oftenbeen tempted to gamble with his estate but a sense of pride a respect for his forefathers a wholesome fear of consequences hadalways checked him when temptation saidtry once more and win temptation wasnot for a long time strong enough to breakdownall the barriers of prudencenemilostivy had however been watchingthe growing prosperity of his neighbour'speasantry and mashenka's family was remarkableamong the prosperous the gradualaccumulation of wealth by frugal industryis sometimes quite surprising andmashenka's example had spread its influencethrough the serfs on the milostivyestate which had in a few years obtainedcelebrity for its superior mushrooms andmushroomhunting do not wonder

was there he looked round himand was astonished at the neatness and comforton every side i do not mean that itwas comparable to an english peasant's happyhome but to milostivy it was a sight suchas he

mashenka shouldaccompany himthe serjeant answered him in a friendlytone on which ivan broke out into a longdescription of mashenka's merits and virtuesand the service she could do and her

obtained a commissionfrom the emperor had intreated that hemight be stationed at the military colonies first because he wished to remove himselffar away from all the scenes where selfreproachand sorrow went with him at everystep and secondly because he thought itwas really a scene of great usefulness wherehe might reestablish a credit that was brokenand regain the peace of mind that had longago abandoned him he had determined toforget the past for in it there was no more of pleasure it seemed to lii a darkand dreary spot to which it was misery toturn he avoided every occupation

extent of which the of moscow is a title of fameselfishness i wonder wliy you cry said a youngprince to his governess one day i wonderwhy you cry for i am quite well so much adulation and misconstruction turnedaside the natural current of his affections thatthe boy thought only of himself and thoughttoo that everybody else was occupied inthinking of him alone it is by such mistakesthat all the generous feelings are eradicatedand it is thus that the mischiefs andmiseries caused by wicked princes have theirorigin in the foolish flatteries of those whoform their charactersthis observation fell from mr howard one minor moralsday and produced a great impression on thechildren it set them thinking on the distinctionbetween selfishness and prudence qualities very different but very ipt to beconfoundedwhat a bad opinion the governess musthave had of the prince said georgebut how badly she must have taughthim edith ejaculated for such a selfishnotion would never have got into the boy'shead of itself it must have been put therebysomebodyi don't think edith responded george that the way to make people wise and goodis to flatter them so foolishly and to talk tothem as if all the world were made to be subservientto themlet's ask papa whether the governess reprovedthe prince whispered arthur to hlssister selfishness we want to know papa said edithif the governess corrected the prince andhowi am afraid not answered mr howardthough it would have been very fitting totell the lad who had then every expectationof being a king that there were other personsin the world besides himself who wereintitled to some thought and care but donot judge the poor prince too harshly hewas but what his teachers made him hewas trained and taught to consider himselfas everything and everyone else as nothingnothing but in the proportion in which theycould minister to his desires and gratificationsnot long after he used the expression whichshowed what an unfortunate training his mindhad received the race was dethroned to whichhe belonged and the discipline of adversitywill perhaps have taught him that selfishness minor moralsand a regard to selfinterest are far differentthingsi know a selfish man and i will give yousome traits in his character he will not doanother man a service if he can help it becausehe fancies that in doing a service withoutan immediate return he is giving somethingaway in waste he forgets that he obtainsfor the service the desire to do him other serviceshe forgets that the gratitude of othersis fertile in acts of kindness in what is thesentiment of gratitude but thoughts of kindness thoughts which will become deeds ofkindness when the occasion offers but theselfish man fancies he is poorer because hehas transferred something to another eventhough that something cost him nothing but afriendly will or a friendly word while reallyby adding to the happiness of others the virtuousman strengthens and increases his ownselfishness the selfish man wants to establish an instantbarter for all the good he does not reflectingthat though the good he does may not produceimmediate fruits it is in the permanent natureof good to be fruitful albeit the harvest isoften distant the selfish man on the otherhand exacts services and kindness from otherswithout considering himself obliged to repaythem while he lends nothing on the fairchances of profit so he will borrow withoutintending to pay either principal or interestthe selfish man is a bad calculator even onhis own selfish grounds he might if he chosegive much to others without making anythe least sacrifice himself he might obtainmuch from others the return for which wouldcost him nothing at allbut the man whose selfishness is prudentand wise will be benevolent because he isprudently and wisely selfish he will see that minor moralsbenevolence is the best selfish calculation that he realizes more by it than he could doby any other habit he finds that he getsgreat interest upon all the outlay of his friendlyand generous feelings he discovers wereit nothing but an estimate of profits and lossesthat he gains more and sacrifices less by hisdisposition to serve others than he could gainor save by a contrary disposition all truthsare linked to all other truths and there isnothing in the chain more beautiful or harmoniousthan the communion and identity ofthe selfish with the benevolent principle theselfish when regarded in its widest bearingsthe benevolent when brought home to individualsway all the disorders of society springfrom the quarrel between the fancied interestsof the one or the few contending with theinterests of the many every error everycrime is but the representation of a man orselfishness men who set themselves up in hostility topublic opinion and the general weal whata result of peace and felicity will be producedwhen the moralist can demonstratethat there is nothing so prudent as benevolence nothing so benevolent as prudence i will exemplify my meaning by an anecdoteor two continued mr howard thoughi believe you will understand my meaningand as i hope feel the distinctions i meantto point outa poor man had been greatly wrongedby his master his master was a particularfriend of mr ego whose servant the poorman had been and he fancied that mr egowho had great influence with his master mightwithout mischief to himself or anybody repairthe vitong the poor man went to mr egoand told his story adding that he doubted notif mr ego would mention the matter that minor moralslies master would reconsider the grievancesunder which he was suffering and it wasa case in which mr ego might have interferedwithout intrusiveness but when the poorman applied to him he answered in a surlytone what shall i get by meddling in youraffairs cannot you settle your own quarrelswithout involving me now mr ego had he been really a prudentperson would have considered that hedid get something by obtaining the goodopinion the grateful opinion of the poor manand he might further have inquired whethersupposing the claim one of strict justice hewas doing a service alike to the poor man'smaster to the poor man and to himself aspeacemaker between them but he left thepoor man indignant with him and his friend also he left his friend in the path of wrong whenhe might have led him into that of rightselfishness and he lost the claim he might have establishedon the thankfulness of the servant and themaster by causing an act of justice to bedone to boththe memory of imagined wrongs that aredone and of imagined rights that are deniedlives long in the mind the poor man leftmr ego with bitterness of thought which ifit had found safe occasion at that momentwould have broken out into violence andyou will suppose my children in order tocomplete the moral of my tale that i shalltell you some instance in which the poor manbeing able to do mr ego some act of kindnessrefused it and thus punished him for his unwillingnessto discharge an obvious dutyand such truly was the first impulse of thepoor man's reflections but he reflected again and he asked himself what motive he haddisapproving of mr ego's conduct to make minor moralsthat conduct the guide and model of his own was the punishment of the past or a betterexample for the future most likely to influencemr ego or to serve the poor man's interestswho could doubtand the occasion occurred which put thepoor man's philosophy to the test it wassome time after the circumstance i mentionedand time had been given to the poor manto meditate on the pastthere was a contested election in the townparties were pretty evenly balanced so evenlythat a few votes might turn the scale andthe poor man was in a position to decide thefate of either candidateof the candidates mr ego was one ohhow bitterly did he repent of having refuseda friendly and reasonable service to the poorman what would he not have given to havehad that hour of his existence to pass overselfishness again to pass it over with the benefit of hispresent experience now he felt that theremight be something in future events to repaypresent conduct now he saw that the friendlydeeds men do to one another are not somuch loss but so much gain upon the wholemr ego's ambition was raised to the highestpitch his desire of success his dread ofdisappointment were both tormenting hisexistence and in the man whom he hadrefused to serve he saw the arbiter of hisfatethat poor man however he determinedto visit making up his mind to the humiliationof a bitter reproof and doubting whetherhis known political opinions which were thoseof the elector he was about to seek wouldobtain favour at the hands of one whom heknew had such reason to complain but somuch depended on the poor mean's conduct minor moralsthat it was necessary at all events to attemptto conciliate himwith his hat in his hand and a smileupon his countenance mr ego entered thepoor man's dwelling abashed and selfreprovedhe hardly knew how to ask for thesupport of the poor but honest elector hewas soon relieved from his embarrassment bythe poor man's offering him his hand and saying sir my first impulse was to give youa lesson of punishment and to recall to yourmind the words that once fell from your lips but but no more my friend no moresaid mr ego the lesson is severe enoughalready i want no other monitor than myconscience my vote is yours answered the elector he who has the courage to own he was wronggives the best evidence that he has resolvedselfishness to he right the poor man lent his supportto mr ego and mr ego won his electioni have watched mr ego closely addedmr howard he is not quite the man thata wise and thoughtful prudence would makehim but his very selfishness has rooted outa portion of selfishness from his mind andhe feels now that he has more profit tohimself from kindness than he could have fromunkindness he feels that benevolence is anobler and more gainful policy than selfishness while every calculation that he makes advanceshim one step farther on the path of real virtuedo you understand my meaning my gentleedithindeed papa i think i do you meanthat we do not get anything by being illnaturedbut that we get something by beingkind and goodyes love answered mr howard andvol ii k minor moralswhy should we not for if we are made happierby our kindness and goodness and others aremade happier then all are made happier becausethere is nobody in the world but ourselvesand everybody else but i have been ratherdry and ethical this evening and was afraidyou would not be interested in what i wassaying indeed we were interested said george for though now and then you used somewords we did not quite comprehend yet wesaw the drift of all you said and we shallnot confound the selfishness that is wise withthe selfishness that is foolishaffection for inanimateobjectsthe conversation of the previous night deeplyimpressed the minds of the young people and they were rather flattered with the ideathat mr howard had been talking to themin a manner complimentary to their intelligence reasoning with them rather thanamusing them it was indeed mr howard'spurpose so to blend information with enjoymentas to make both of them as palatableand pleasurable as possible pleasure solid substantial pleasure was theend he proposed to himself and his childrennot a pleasure leaving pain behindit he would have preferred a pain that left minor moralsa pleasure but pleasure which when siftedand sifted again was pleasure still pleasureunaccompanied by vexation reproach orregretin this temper as we have seen thehoward family gave to their conversationsthe widest range by and by we may pourtraythem in their more serious studies aswe have done in their leisure hoursbut papa said george you saidthat kindness brought back kindness in returnmay not kindness sometimes fail in doingsosurely replied mr howard but thehabit of kindness will never fail and thehabit you know is the result of actsyes said edith but may we not lovepersons and things that cannot love us persons that are dead and things that cannotfeelaffection for inanimate objects undoubtedly you may answered lierfather but that very disposition to lovewins the love of others men cannot helploving those who give them evidence thatthey love them what i would have youencourage for your own happiness is anamiable and loving temper and let thattemper be displayed wherever it can inour intercourse with other human beings andwith a considerable part of the brute creationwe have always as i have said a strongmotive for rendering them friendly servicesinasmuch as they are able and will be willingto render us friendly services in returnbut there are also thousands of objectswhich are sources of pleasure and subjectsof sympathy independently of any positivegood they can do us attachment to inanimatethings with which pleasure has beenassociated sometimes becomes almost a passion minor moralsthere is a famous passage in one of themoorish poets expressing in strong terms thesentiments with which the sioht of the firstpalm tree introduced into spain inspired oneof the moorish monarchs it was the renownedalderman he made for himself abeautiful garden in the most beautiful partof which he planted a palm tree the palmtree which the moors maintained to be

favourite treehis melancholy says an arabic historianwhich he thought of allaying by all thepleasant thoughts and stories which the palmtree would bring to his mind only increasedupon him and the following is a faithfulversion of one of the soliloquies he uttered affection for inanimate objects beautiful palm thou chief of treesthou wert a stranger treebut now the sweet algerian breezesalutes

uprooted by the tempest and with it athousand interesting recollections i own that ihave often turned towards these trees with somethinglike respect and affection and that ithink of them still as of distant and departedfriends one belonging to the living and theother to the deadonce while i was looking at the palmtrees a fancy came across my mind that iwas present at one of the scenes described inthe civil wars of spain by the romantic hisaffectionfor inanimate objects tories or rather the poets of that country imagined i saw the moor abdallah as heis described by the chronicler sad and verythoughtful and all his hopes departed surroundedby followers who had sheathed theirswords and who looked mournfully at oneanother and at their chieftain having heardthat their last and strongest fortress had beentaken by the spaniards and that the succoursthey had long expected had returned to africain despair abdallah's companions were fewand none of them illustrious there wasscarcely a straggler in the roads except shriekingwomen and miserable children even thewarriors who had acquired the most renownhad abandoned all human habitations and werewandering in the byeroads of the mountainshungry and unshelteredit was under one of the pain trees nowso venerable that abdallah gathered his last minor moralscouncil of war i fancied i saw the chieftainsassemble there and heard the harangue whichthe chronicler has put into the mouth of theirmonarch valiant men and brethren wehave toiled and triumphed in vain algiershas betrayed turkey has deserted us fezand morocco have been deaf to our supplicationswe have lost our citadels and ourships hunger has destroyed us more mercilesslythan arms our wives and childrenperish they invoke either captivity or death surrender then though i cannot surrenderanother sun is rising while mine is darkeninginto night the vow that i have vowed tothe prophet i must keep it only brings withit the doom of perpetual solitude where i willmeditate on your virtues and mine own adversitythe women says the chronicler allburst into tears and the warriors said let ushave peace and the word peace peace affection for inanimate objects passed from lip to lip as a fragrant flower mightpass from hand to hand and habaqui thevaliant with a white flag which he placed ona lance went to the christian king anda treaty of peace was made made to bebroken abdallah deserted by his ancientfollowers wandered long among the mountainswhere he was hunted like a beast ofprey and being at last discovered was orderedto granada there to die as he passed nearone of the palm trees that reminded him ofother days he broke out into bitter lamentationsand was much more sorrowfully affectedthan he had been by all the misery he hadwitnessed the chronicler says that as hewas descending on his mule down the precipitousside of a mountain where there wasa deep ravine below he took a last look atthe palm trees and flung himself into theabyss being dashed to pieces among the sharp minor moralsand cruel rocks the spaniards found hiscorpse there and decapitated it suspendinghis head in an iron cage with an insultinginscription which an historian of spain sayshe himself had seen calling abdallah atraitor dogoften does some inanimate object becomeas it were the text of history places whichhave been the scenes of great and interestingevents are dear to individuals and to nationsthey have the celebrated spots they love aswell as the illustrious men they honour allthe feelings may be called into action wherethere is no real response to them from inanimatenature but to fancy such responsesis one of the most pleasing and most powerfulattributes of genius and sometimes theimpression is so strong as to give a sortof vitality to introduce a living principle amidst the very silence and stillness of natureaffection for inanimate objects i recollect papa said arthur when youshowed us runnymede that i could not butfancy all the barons assembled there for thesigning of magna chartaand said edith when we went to thetower and you papa pointed out the placewhere the infant king edward and his brotherwere murdered i could hardly help shriekingfor it seemed to me as if the murderers werethere and that i could hear the cries of thepoor childrenon such occasions answered mr howardthe imagination is very busy as it is assistedby the presence of objects which becomelike outlines to be filled up by recollectionsi well remember when i was travelling toforces in scotland near the spot where ifancied that macbeth had met the witchesit was in the twilight of evening that threewitchlike forms appeared in the mist before minor moralsme standing on the lieatli near a fire ilooked and looked again and felt as if iwere in the presence of the weird sistersthey seemed to be solemnly walking roundthe burning cauldron into which they threwthe charms as they moved along and iheard their deep and solemn voices and sawevery nowandthen with more distinctnesstheir haggard forms i approached nearer the illusion vanished which had been createdby the associations of the dramatic poet andthe dreary place there were three peasantswho had been making themselves a fire ofgorse upon the heath and in the state of mymind at that time it required little to makethe scene and the action verify what shakspearehas so strikingly imaginedprudence there was a philosopher in ancient timewho taught that there is only one virtuenamely prudence if he had said that therewere only two prudence and benevolencehe would have been quite right i think papa said george we all ofus begin to see pretty clearly that the othervirtues are not of much valuemy friend the philosopher not apollosrejoined mr howard used to say thatthere are only two persons in the world youand everybody else mr self and mr allbesidesmr self s business with himself is in concerns minor moralsof prudence his business with mr allbesides ismostly in concerns of benevolence when theyhave transactions together they interchange prudenceand benevolence in all the affairs wheremr allbesides is not concerned all that mrself has to do is to take care of himself he isto take care of himself too when he has todowith mr allbesides but in order to get asmuch as he can out of mr allbesides mr selfmust do him as much service as he is ableall this means that it is prudent to be prudentand prudent to be benevolent so that in factthere is one sense in which the ancient philosopherwas right in saying that there is novirtue but prudence or rather that all virtueswhen thoroughly understood are but prudence for unless benevolence itself gave a manpleasure no man would be benevolent and itis certainly prudent to get as much pleasureas possible as much of pleasure which isprudence not followed by pain the pleasures of benevolenceare as much a man's own as anyother pleasures and he has the same interestin possessing them as in possessing any othersif i were called upon to point out that portionof man's nature which most clearly exhibitshow much he was designed to be madehappier by virtue would refer to that whichproves his own interests to be so intimatelyconnected with the wellbeing of his fellowsno man so certainly provides for his ownhappiness no man obtains for himself somuch of happiness no man lays in a stockof happiness of so pure and perfect a characteras he whose happiness is most intervenedwith the happiness of mankind i hope mychildren said mr howard that i makemyself understood will you each explainto me what he supposes is my meaningi understand you perfectly papa said minor moralsedith i feel pleased when others arepleased i am always uncomfortable when isee that mamma or you are unhappy if anybodywere to offer to take some of yourhappiness away and to give it to me insteadi don't think i should thank them for itno my dear girl and it would be afoolish proposal for generally speaking themore we give of happiness to others the morewe keep for ourselves every kind word weutter and every kind act we do is a proofthat we really understand how to be as happyas possible somebody has said do nothingwrong in society for you will lose the goodopinion of others do nothing wrong in solitudefor you will lose your own you havetherefore in both cases a very decided interestin good conduct for nobody loses the goodopinions of others and still less his own goodopinion without sufferingprudence the great moral distinction between menand brutes is that men depend for their ownpleasures more than brutes do upon the conductof others many animals live lonely orsolitary lives and even when they are associatedtogether it is for purposes of selfdefenceit is very rare that

the daughter of a profligatemother who treated her from her very infancywith little kindness her mother had seen muchaffliction but that had not made her discreetshe had lost her husband with whom herprudencelife had been miserable for she was carelessof her dress careless of her house accustomedto spend all she had regardless of the comingof the morrow so that when the morrowcame and her husband was out of workhunger came with it and wretchedness andwretchedness was soon followed by apathyand recklessness she sold or pledged thelittle furniture they had and then her smallstock of clothes and in the midst of her privationsher husband died and the overseersof the parish who had long been weariedwith her importunities forced her to enter theworkhouse and as i said before in the workhousemartha was bornmartha was a sickly child and small wasthe attention she received from her motheroften as the visitors passed by they saidthat poor child cannot live long but therewas an old woman a pauper in the ward who minor moralsmade up for the mother's want of kindness andacted the part of a parent to the poor infantmuch indeed it wanted care but in the mereinvoluntary motions of its lips the old womanfancied she saw a smile and soon it reallysmiled and then the old woman said it wasthe image of a child she had lost fiveandfortyyears before and she would kiss it andfondle it with exceeding affection well itwas that the helpless baby found such a friend its mother gave herself no concern about itone day she left the workhouse it wassupposed of course she would return toher child but she did not nor was she heardof again nor from that day to the endof martha's existence had she ever tidings ofher mothermartha was less than twelve months oldwhen thus deserted by her mother the oldwoman applied to the overseer to be allowedprudence to take charge of the child and permissionwas granted and martha never experiencedthe want of a mother's presence true apoorhouse is a sad scene whether for childhoodor age but she had known nothingbetter and had not to contrast its wants withany memory of greater enjoyments it wasin many respects a useful though a hard educationfor from her cradle martha wastrained to privation she was fed with coarsefood and clothed in common garments butshe grew stronger and stronger she was ahappy little creature and was a favouriteamong all the inmates of the poorhouseis not a poorhouse a wretched place asked edithit would seem wretched very wretchedto you edith but that which is wretchednessto some is comfort to others and happily thestandard of enjoyment and suffering is accom minor moralsrotated by providence to our habits and ourcircumstancesmartha was not four years old beforeshe exhibited marks of that prudence whichdistinguished her through afterlife wheneating the porridge that was provided for thepaupers she was observed never to spill adrop and when she had done she replacedthe vessel on the shelf with the greatest careif at any time she could spare a portion ofthe food that was brought her she laid itaside for another occasion she had neverheard the proverb waste not want notbut it seemed as if a thoughtful care of thefuture was a part of her very naturenobody knows how much good may bedone by a little prudent care i will giveyou an instance one of the paupers incutting her bread injured her hand very seriouslythere was no surgeon at hand noprudence means of dressing the wound or of assuagingthe pain little martha who was then onlysix years old came into the room and sawwhat the poor woman was suffering she hadpicked up and preserved with her usualattention the remains of some ointment whichshe had seen used but which had beenthrown out of the window as of no valueshe spread it on a rag and gave it to thewoman it answered the end it healed thewound do not think these things triflingmy children for martha's prudence was benevolenttoo and in little instances like thisit was exhibitedin matters where the cultivation of usefulhabits is concerned there is really nothingthat is unimportant the means which thethe poor possess of doing good are small and the means which the children of thepoor possess are smaller still but prudencevol ii l minor moralsand benevolence do not depend so much for theirmerit on the number of persons who benefitby them as on their intrinsic value for theywho possess them will exercise them wheneverand wherever they are able and theycan only be exercised in that station whichit is our lot to occupyyou may fancy that in the humble spherein which martha lived with so few of thepleasures and with none of the luxuries oflife she had few occasions to exhibit abstinenceor temperance or any of the virtuesof restraint but it was not so there is nosituation without temptations foolish thoughtsoccur to all discontent and murmuring arealmost the natural result of the privations ofthe poor the inequality of conditions is hardto bear and harder perhaps to explaina circumstance occurred in the poorhousewhich interfered with martha's peace of mindprudence and troubled her with painful reflections ofwhich she could not for a long time get rida relation of one of the girls of the poorhousehad returned from abroad having amassedconsiderable wealth and had sent for thisinmate of the poorhouse who returned dazzledwith all the gay and rich things shehad seen to tell her companions of her goodfortune and that she was to be taken intothe house of her rich relation and to bemade a lady at once martha was at thistime between eleven and twelve years oldshe listened at first with delight but afterwardsin silence and sorrow to all her companiontold her of splendid apartments andfurniture and gay beds and liveried servantsand carriages and horses and all the gorgeousthings that riches buy one thought tookpossession of poor martha's mind a thoughtthat grew darker and darker what have minor moralsi done that all these enjoyments are

heardenough to show her that she was among thelowest and meanest of the human race shehad not seen much but whenever she hadeft the poorhouse all that she observed lookedhappier more comfortable than that she wasaccustomed to see on one occasion she wasinvited and obtained leave to visit her formercompanion who was no longer dressed inthe coarse garb of the workhouse but worehandsome clothes and had even servants toattend her martha trembled as she mountedthe carpetcovered stairs her friend spokekindly to her and said she had mentionedher name to her relation and she hoped heprudence would interest himself about her marthacould hardly say she thanked her for thethought of her own inferiority came acrossher at that moment with such bitterness thatshe returned to the poorhouse in tears andfancied she should never be happy againbut martha's grief poignant though itwas was gradually lessened by reflecting thatinstead of rendering her condition bettergrief would only make it worse what doi get she said to herself by the discontentwhich is but another evil added to all therest why should i increase my privationsby depriving myself of my peace of mindand thus martha did really drive away hergloomy reflections and in the place of themshe indulged in hopes that some day or otherher lot might be more fortunateand so it turned out for a few daysafterwards a notice came from the overseerl minor moralsthat a situation was found for martha shewent to it accompanied by the best wishesof all the poor people among whom she hadbeen born and bred and they said as sheleft them she always was a good girl andlet good luck be with her always martha was soon found to be a treasurein the family into which she had enteredgrateful for all kindness she made a gratefulreturn the prudence which had before butlittle to exercise itself on now became amost useful and important virtue her thriftinessand care found ample employment andher trustworthiness obtained for her more andmore the confidence of all she could notbear to waste any thing and her previoussituation had trained her to attach some valueto trifles which are too often whollydisregardedexperience had taught martha the imprudenceprudence and the folly of indulging in painfulthoughts as she grew older she found thatwe may habitually if we please dwell uponpleasant thoughts and this experience mademartha one of the wisest of women shewas always cheerful because her mind wasconstantly occupied with cheerful reflectionsand her hands engaged in cheerful dutiesher labours were lightened by a perpetualgaiety not a thoughtless or a frivolous indifference but a disposition which would findin every exertion something to encouragehope or to reward with happiness i didnot intend my children to tell you much ofa story in speaking of martha martin iwanted to show you by an example the valueof thoughtful prudence martha occupies nowthough still young the highest situationin the family where
