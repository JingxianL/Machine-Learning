jacque tell us aboutgrandpa's locket and how he diedjacque had been intrusted with the entire control ofhis young master's household during the term of his educationin europe and while the confidence placed inhim had somewhat increased his selfconceit it never inducedhim to take a liberty beyond those which his peculiarsituation authorized roseland from the beautyof its location and its valuable paintings was frequentlyvisited by strangers in the absence of its orphan proprietorand it is a singula fact that jacque was never knownto ascend the hall stairs on such occasions he pointedout the

year roseland wasmade doubly beautiful by the birth of a noble boy thepride of the house and plantation this happiness wasnot of long duration for the times approached which triedamerican souls and the young father was called fromthe peaceful sunshine of his home from the caresses ofhis wife and the prattle of his child to the wild andstormy hardships of war the night before his departurehis wife led him to his likeness by copley whichstill hangs in the hall and perused his lineaments longand earnestly she gazed on the manly form beside herthen on the graceful but inanimate representative tookin the loving glance of the living eye and compared itwith its calmer image then with a bitter sigh sank into recollections ofhis arms the young soldier comforted her with a husband'slove and drew her to the bedside of their sleepingboy little henry started from his repose as theybent over him with whispered words clung to his father'sneck a moment and then closing his eyes like the bell ofa twilight flower sank upon his pillowwith his beautiful wife still resting on his arm the fathertook from his desk a locket containing her hairthrew the black riband from which it was suspendedabout

reposed in the arms of happy love hadfound a cold and bloody bed with the promiscuous slainamong whom not even faithful friendship could detect hissemblance at length jacque found on a mutilated

returnedand my grandmother had kept her young son awake withgentle artifice for companionship a footstep was heardin the piazza and dash gave a growl between warningand recognition while henry

her as with a papercap and wooden sword he marched about her apartmentthreatening to revenge his father's deathjacque was for several days revolving a measure ofimportance in his own mind and at length determiningto give it utterance went to claim a few moments attentionfrom his mistressshe could only shade her eyes as if to shut out toopainful an object and with one hand pressed closely

recollections of awith an animated voice she said my tear good jacquecan he be brought to me gbd bless you for thethought a motive for action was now given her and her heartseemed lightened of a part of its burden it was a consolationto her to take henry by the hand and go forthin search of an appropriate spot for her husband's graveit seemed to her excited imagination like preparing anapartment for an absent friendhere mamma said her prattling boy is a prettyplace papa used to stand under this tree and throwchips into the pond for dash to bring to meno my son said his mother musingly it is toofar i must see the spot from my window lookhenry at the cluster of cedars oh that slightlyrisingground see how the sun shines on the treetops whileall beneath is gloom like my hopes she

whereshall i go mamma he had unconsciously touched the light string and asshe stooped to kiss his forehead she patiently resolvedto wait god's will and live for himy while these scenes of tenderness were beguiling thefeelings of the widow jacque with a band of fellowservantswent on his melancholy errand even to theimagination which only partially illuminated the uneducatedmind of the negro the contrast was strong betweenthe aspect of that now silent field and the recent periodwhen contending forces with weapons flashing in the sunand faces tinged with expectation and footsteps timed tothe march of war had passed before him it was amoonlight night one of those nights which seem to exaggeratebrightness and stillness when jacque led theway to his master's rude gravetis a pretty sight my young masses and missishe used to say when relating this story while we stoodwith inward tremour almost expecting the pictures ofsouthern matron our grandparents to start from their frames tis a prettything for see one corpse lay out handsome on he naturalbed wid he head to de east and he limb straight and heeye shut and he white shroud and de watchers singpsalm but twas altogether unnatural to see my poormaussa wid de regiments on and de vermin busy bouthim and de moonlight shine down and de owl hootbern niggers natural fools get scare when we get tomaussa self den says i my men how you been letfolks say dat we have christian grave while our maussawhat fed us and covered us was laying mong wolf tit's an ugly job but to it my men and as it is a disrespectto sing heave ho one of you strike up a hymn tohelp us on duncan's departure was indeed an impressive lessonfor i knew that he must die and this event more thanany other served to create the vivid impression whichi have always felt of the close connexion between motalk and immortality perhaps had i seen the pangs ofdissolution and witnessed his form laid in its narrowhouse and heard the winds rush over his grave withoutchilling hrs repose and seen the sun shed down its lightupon it without unclosing those eyes which had so oftensparkled in its rays i might have dwelt on his materiality but from the moment that he pressed my hand illparting and gave a last melancholy smile as the caresrecollections of arage drove from the door i connected him with heavent said his mind cannot dieearly in november we departed for the plantationlewis who with his family had been residing at springlandthrough the summer hastened from the elms afterour temporary separation to welcome us his feelingswere touched by the loss of our friend and his sympathymade him doubly welcome i soon found however thatthe force of duncan's example which had evidently beena check on his manners wore away and occasionally heuttered an oath or a sentiment forbidden in the christianschool of love and purity the elasticity of sixteendid not conceal from me that this was wrong for theprinciples implanted by duncan forbade my contemplatingthe indulgence of trifling error with complacencyand his departure made me revert to his lessons as asacred gift committed to my are i observed with sorrowthat whoever did not reach a certain standard oftaste and fashion were subjects of lewis's ridicule goodness seemed to him nothing for its own sake hecared not for the warmth of the sun without its glaregenerous and even lavish in his habits he was penuriousin that best of all charity that studies the feelings ofothers yet he was our guest and commanded mycourtesy and there was besides a fascination abouthim that won my favour it is impossible for a younggirl to see a discriminating man assume the most deferentialdeportment to her while ridiculing others withoutsome vanity and as i trusted that his heart was right ienjoyed his humorous satire hoping not to compromisemy sense of rectitude by it and the bright intellect oflewis his playful manners his devotion to me and thesympathy of youth would probably have taken my affectionscaptive at once had not the character of duncanand the peculiar circumstances of his departure createdfor me an elevated standard of manly virtue and ratherturned the romance of early feeling towards his memorymy parents sincere respect had been awakened byduncan's character how delightful is it to think thatgoodness multiplies itself and that in the ocean of wrongsouthern matltoh one little point of truth may more circle on circle almostindefinitely papa rejoiced as all men even the profligatewill rejoice to see his daughter's mind trained topiety and mamma in her faithful attendance on duncan'swants perceived a purer atmosphere created aroundher earthly path new ties were awakened between usand i soon found an echo in her heart unknown to mebefore the time was rapidly approaching far lewis's returnto college those delicate and frequent attentions whichtell the tale of the heart were certainly not without theirpower in softening mine and i lost my sadness at thethought of duncan one fine afternoon my toothless and myself visited theelms in a rowboat and lewis returned with us by thelight of the moon which looked down on the silverywales of the ashley as if refreshed with its own fairimaged the foliage of the trees was pictured like sunkenforest of verdure in the pellucid stream the call of anightbird to its mate a boathorn waking the echoesand the mysterious talk of solitary nature were the nfsounds abroad and these were drowned in the plash ofout oars and the bursts of daughter from our merry groupcome juba said lewis to the head oarsman u

with shouts of laughterand called for again and again until the echoes of the vashley shouted encore but all the solicitations ofthe young men were ineffectual with juba who lookedthe personification of composureit is not remarkable that my thoughts should havebeen occupied in a lonely stroll on the following daywiththe subject of juba's song nor that i should turnmy steps to a footpath which had been trodden by thenegroes from mr barnwell's residence to ours notof course to go there for it was two miles off but it wasa sweet romantic walk and for half the distance branchingtrees knit by clustering vines formed a secluded anddelicious arbour i strayed on animated by thosethoughts and reveries that lift the form along like abird's at one point the scenery was so lovely that istopped to gaze on it and my elastic feelings were aboutbursting out into song when i heard a groan i started it was repeated i knew from the accompanying ejaculationthat it was from a negro and as a planter's daughterfears none but white men i hastened to discover theobject i was surprised on turning from the path tofind among the bushes a servant of mr barnwell's disabledwhat is the matter bill said i to the boy whowas about sixteen years of age he looked sullenlyand gave no replyare you hurt said i can i do anything for you i can go home or even to mr barnwell's and get helpmaster lewis will come to you in a momentthkrn matron bill no want maus lewis said the boy bitterlyshaking his head if old maussa come bery well butmaus lewis i could not distinguish the remainderof the sentencei was perplexed to know what to do and was turninghomeward when another groan arrested my attentionand i saw bill attempt p rise in evident painyou are foolish boy said i not to tell me whattroubles you and let me call lewisbill's eyes glared fiercely for a moment and turningdown the collar of his jacket i saw the blood streamingfrom his neck while he uttered through his shut teethm maus lewis i started as if a voice of thunder had sounded on myear papa's and mr barnwell's plantations like mostothers at the south were regulated with almost militaryprecision no punishment was ever inflicted but by anauthorized person and if he overstepped the boundariesof mercy in his justice he was expelled from his authorityfrom my infancy i had never seen a gentlemanforget the deportment of a gentleman to our slaves deliberationwas the leading trait of papa's character as amaster though his feelings were in other respects ardent and he was never wearied in ascertaining the circumstancesof any case which required it slaves are notshut up in prisons or made the gaze of an unfeeling publicat the bar but a strict superintending hand is necessaryto maintain that discipline without which not eventhe social hearth can be preserved free from strifei gazed on the boy with commiseration he mighthave been guilty of wrong but lewis's was not the handto chastise him and i could not check the mental inquiryif one who could yield to his passions with an inferiorwould not be an imperious companion with an equalas i stood thus i saw lewis approach he did notperceive bill and advanced gayly i presume the expressionof my face was unusual as i looked from himto the boy his eyes turned in the same direction an angryflush kindled on his face and for a moment his ratanwas lifted as in threat another glance of my eyet bacllbctim op achanged his expression sod he began the story of hisoffenceno matter what it was a charm was lost to mesneof the golden threads that had linked my imaginetion to the beautiful and good was snapped asunder norwas it united when lewis with a look of sorrow threwfrom his purse a pecuniary compensation to the boybut youth is full of hope and forgiveness lewis wassorry bill as cheerful as before and it was not manydays ere the former was replaced in my confidence besideshe was about to leave us and though he hadnever said he loved me and my happy temperamentcared not for the declaration yet i felt that his absencewould leave a chasm in our little circleone sabbath evening just before his departure as iwas playing some sacred melodies he took up a songbookcornelia this is a very sacred sir said he turningto a popular song i an sure it has elevated my feelingsmore than half the psalmtunes that people singthrough their noses do sing it i looked at him with surprise cornelia continuedhe laughing don't look so solemnly i suppose youwould stop the mouth of the mockingbird that is singingbis everyday song on the catalpatree because he hasnot a sunday tune or shut up the flowercups for dressingtoo gayly lthe birds and flowers have had no revelation lewissaid i to tell them to reverence the sabbatha look that i scarcely understood and yet could notbut disapprove and a short whistle were his answerjust sing this song for me cornelia persisted heand i will not ask for another i am sure it is solemnenough and what if it is a lovesong are we not commandedto love one another and he looked at me soearnestly that i blushed and knew not what to say butshook my head disapprovinglythen play me this overture urged he and i willgive up the song what can be more sublime than thisopening v pointing to the notessotjthmn matrons m i cannot play anything lewis said i but what isconsecrated by the original intention of the composer orby sacred use what can you wish for more exquisitethan these pieces of handel and haydn which are notonly perfect in themselves but have the charm of holyassociations and what melody is finer than the old englishpsalmody here are the three tunes mentioned inthe cotter's saturday night which mr duncan lovedto hear oh the sabbath twilight shall i sing them foryou kduncan for ever duncan said lewis in a suppressedvoice i wish you had never known that puritanicalyankee but seeing me look offended he continuedhumbly you will not play what i wish you to v t l no lewis i answered effectually brought to selfpossessionby his sarcasm on one so dear to mebut cornelia said he m this is altogether a matterof prejudice one of the most sensible girls and themost exquisite singer in does not hesitate to singand play popular airs on sunday eveningtell her then when you next meet her said irising and leaving the pianoforte m that she does notdeserve the gift which god has given her that the higherher voice rises in the scale of harmony the lower sinksher sense of moral and religious duty ask her if it isindeed too much for one whom god has endowed withsuch powers to devote them one day in seven to him and never dare mr barnwell to use a name so sacredas that of charles duncan disrespectfully in my presence the name of one and my eyes filled with tearswho is perhaps now looking on me from his

to see him after his decease and though i did notfeel the faintness which came over me at witnessing theremains of grand mamma yet i had that dizzy sensationwhich youth often experiences at the immense differencebetween a bright intellectual glanceand the glazed eyeor moveless lid between the warm touch of affectionand the stiff cold hand that returns no pressure all the little ones came forth from their ablutions withwry faces and blue noses looking like anything ratherthan tranquil young christians and mamma had that stiffair which a determination to keep new clothes for sundayis

takenalone he told me that not on one mountain only isgod worshipped in spirit and in truth but that the woodsand skies are a temple in which as in earthly fanes wemay commune with the deity and i soon realized thistruth nature seemed more still on the sabbath than atother times in our lone and lofty forests the birdschecked their chattering joy and poured out hymns ofpraise the woods waved in calmer reverence and therewas a hush of solemnity in the floating clouds as theycanopied the throne of the invisiblenor were these emotions disturbed by the view of ourcountry church it rose in simple architecture discoveredby its white walls amid the clustering green andthough it was sometimes thought that a sufficient carewas not taken to prune the wild growth around it particularlyin the graveyard where affection could scarcelyread the record of its love yet the wildness of the spotseemed to me to suit the mood of revery which falls onthe thoughtful rambler amid forest graves the burialplace was not large for most plantations have their own but it was capacious enough to tell the usual tale of infancywithered in its early bud of manhood cut down inits prime and of old age seeking its last repose thebirds scarcely restrained by winter poured out their songsover the dead the gray moss hung floating from ihejauving walls rosebushes unchecked and untrained wavedin the winds and a tame deer which no one claimed resortedthither loving the sabbath communion of humanh recollections of abeings it was a simple scene and where was itscharm i have heard that those who have crossed theocean and seen the tombs of buried intellect in england'sgreat metropolis and gazed on the ruins of fallen greatnessin luxurious italy and pondered on the easternpyramids towering over a handful of dust in the midstof the lofty speculations incident in such scenes wouldrevert tp the place of their early worship and the thoughtof it would come like the gushing of a cool stream overthe v soul what is this charm t answer simple untaughtnature for the voice can only rise from thee but with all this sensibility to external objects i hadlistened to the ritual and preaching of this church almostuntouched for our minister and may god forgive himwas cold himself unkindled with that sense of his highvocation which lends ardour to prayer and power to exhortationhow could his audience feel zeal in serviceswhere they saw no heart it is praise to them that theyperformed their duty how could he expect the soul tohover on the lips of his hearers when reading a prayerin a style which a schoolboy would be corrected forusing and can a clergyman indeed become cold under an officeof mediation between god and man can he enterthe sacred desk unprepared stammering and absentwho has to plead a cause high as heaven wide as eternity i know not but i might as a falliblebeing becamechilled by repetition but i feel that were i a man placedunder the wide responsibility of guiding souls and choosingthat sacred position in society i would cultivateevery power even external attractionashbuld not be beyondmy care i would make pure eloquence my studythat the voice god gave me might call his children toknow him i would cultivate personal purity and gracethat men might be attracted by god's image i wouldplead with them as a hungry man pleads for nourishmentand pray with them as myself

poor little church prayer was offeredup with cold monotony our singing was reduced to thefine squeak of an old lady who would utterly have failedbut for the aid of a few ancient negroes whose ear wasmote true than hers the number of gentlemen aroundthe church until the commencement of the sermon wasgreater than the occupants of thepews within and thesubjects of conversation were of the most

giving out of the text john onceasked a searching question papa are the church prayersonly made for ladies and children oh no my son said papa and i saw a reverentialshade of thought steal over his brow men feel the needof prayerthere was probably more excuse for these worldlydiscussions at our country church than elsewhere goodfriends were parted for a long summer and amid winterbusiness met

wasgenerally different they preserved a serious air on enteringchurch and throughout the service after the blessingwas pronounced began their exchange i do not speakof this in blame it is a part of the social intercourseof southern life necessarily arising from our widelyseparatedestates it preserves us from coldness and i amglad of an opportunity of stating this as strangers havefrequently

humannature she felt no want with her babe in her arms andlanguage oh the language between these two creamtwining of arms the gaze of the eyes thepressure of the lips and when any attempt was madeto take the child from her how that strange howl thrilledthe soul she was faithful in the discharge of her duties the family at the elms treated her with peculiartenderness and the child was the pet of the householdbut her passions like those of most mutes were violentand her mother so fat from pitying treated her wkh brutalityone day when i was visiting at the elms weheard a cry wilder than i had ever known from poorbella her mother had attacked her in anger and levelleda blow with a stick of woody which laid her andher infant on the ground in a week that smiling babywas a corpse by bella's side and she was fast journeyingto the same sad bourn even in death she couldnot let her baby go and her wild cry sounded fierce andlong when any one attempted to remove it it was kidin its shroud by her side she felt its little forehead andcold hands and moaned over its unmoved lips poordelia was tenderly cared for by her mistress and herpious coloured friends stood around her and pointed upwardas if to god she shook her head and clung toher dead infant it was forced from her and placed inits humble coffin and peaceful grave and two days afterbella was laid by its side it is a sad

of arturning round saw an indian in full costume standingwith folded arms against the entrance of the door hiseyes bent directly on me i was so startled that i couldnot proceed in singing i made two or three ineffectualattempts and then preferred passing out of the roomclose to him rather than remains as i rose from theinstrument hiseyes followed me though his attitude wasunchanged and he made a gesture for me to return andplay i went to mamma who decided that i must do she like most southern ladies had no unnecessary fearsshe was in the habit of passing months with her childrenon the plantation without any other protection thanher servants the indian had remained in the sameerect attitude as if he expected our return and asmamma bowed in passing he returned her salutation isat down and played several tunes glancing occasionallyat him his eyes were still fixed on me at length as ipassed he uttered a sound like thank and retired assilently as he came i have never since seen so perfectand interesting specimen of his race there was somethinginexpressibly lofty and graceful in his airon our next visit to the city flora asked me withalmost apparent blushes if she could take a partner and i was made to understand that kit a stevedore hadsolicited her hand of course i could make no objectionthough losing some valuable services by the plan andpreparations were made for the wedding which she choseto have performed in the washkitchen instead of our parlourthe floor was nicely scrubbed seats placed aroundand the tin candlesticks on the wall ornamented withsprigs of green

carriagelong and frequent were the debates with regard to thecolour shape and ornaments and this perhaps is oneevil of a country life that it makes us attach a disproportionateinterest to trifles i inclined to a fawncolourarthur to deep green he preferred a coachman's box i desired an open front that he might sometimes takethe reins the contest once or twice rose pretty highi came down to breakfast one morning with a frown anda determined if not sullen taciturnity and arthur rodeaway a half an hour earlier than usual this broughtme to a recollection of my principle of selfsacrifice intrifles and i was enabled to meet my husband with asmile and say on his returnon the whole arthur i think your deep green wittbe the best colour for the carnage it will wear wellah well dearest said he tenderly smoothing downa curl on my forehead i am glad to hear it and i beginto incline to the open front i shall often wish to beindependent and drive you myselfeverything now seemed to be going on smoothlywhen in looking over arthur's letters one day in an oldchest i found the marion coat of arms it seemed tomea perfect piece of good fortune under what classour arms came whether of pretension of concession ofsouthern matron succession of assumption or of family i could not telli only thought that the dots and diagonal lines and somethingthat looked like two swords crossed would have avery pretty effect on the carriage and as soon as arthurcame in ran and told him i know not exactly why butthe subject struck him in a most ludicrous light so farfrom entering into my views he took the paper in hishand and proposed comical substitutes that would be inbetter keeping cottonbags coupe sweet potatoes vertalligators dormant shrimps gules and trains couchantand running every change which his vivid fancy couldfurnish he ended with a long loud laugh that went tinglingthrough my ears and irritating my system to thevery soles of my feetevery observer of human nature must have perceivedthat lovers not only do not exercise the power of ridiculeover each other but they cannot conceive that the idolof their imaginations should be the subject of it as intercoursein marriage becomes familiar and the littlegraces of etiquette are laid aside the idol though notless worshipped becomes less sacred she is not thedeity of the temple but of the household she is nolonger the great diana of ephesus approached at a distancewith mysterious rites but one of the lares meetingthe familiar glance at every turn this difference isnever felt so keenly by a woman as when she first discoversthat it is possible for her to appear ridiculous toher husband a mtfn who differs from his wife and reasonswith her rather elevates her selflove but the momenthe laughs at her she feels that the golden bowl ofmarried sympathy is broken vhow many kinds of laughter there are the firstclear sweet notes of the infant like the soft tinkling of asilver bell the child's laugh with voice and mind gushingout like a fountain the maiden's laugh when sensibilitytouches her tones like music the rich manlylaugh when wit goes to the recesses of intellect andbrings out its echoes the girl's giggle behind her fan the old man's laugh of habit thai sounds like the windthrough an empty house the maniac's laugh sad and recollections of adreary as the last leaf on a withered tree the parrot'slaugh calling out and yet repelling sympathy with itsnatural unnaturalness arthur's was like none of theseat the moment of which i speak it was one brought outbya sense of the ridiculous and if a sister or wife orchild can stand quietly by and hear such a one she oughtto be immortalized i did not i sat down deliberatelyand had a hearty cry notwithstanding my principle poorarthur who had never thought about all this and fanciedi was enjoying his jests was dismayed he clasped meinhis arms apologized with all the tenderness and sincerityof his nature and i never hoard that laugh againi was in the sequel perfectly satisfied with my airyand elegant carriage entered into the city amusementswith animation went through a february campaign witheclat and had no wishes ungratified that wealth couldprocure letters of introduction were poured in uponus from all quarters and we were glad and proud to behospitable i was prepared one morning to call on a strangerwhen visitors were announced and glancing round thedrawingroom i perceived on the sofa a ratan whichhad been brought in by one of my young brothers icaught it up and twisting it in a coil thrust it into myvelvet reticule and received my guests as soon asthey departed i sprang into the carriage which was inwaiting and drove away the ladies were at home inthe course of conversation i unthinkingly drew my scentedpockethandkerchief from my bag when out flew the ratanwith a bound and rolled to the feet of the stranger mydeep and inextinguishable blush probably helped on anyuncharitable surmises that she might have made andwho can blame her after such evidence for reportingthat charleston ladies carried cousins in their pockets i was the personation of benevolence in my new carriageand unaffectedly enjoyed the pleasure i conferred yet every happiness has its alloy if an acquaintanceexpected a friend at the wharves mrs marion's carriagewas sent for and detained half the day i was kept thevery latest of the company at

tookcold by being overheated in a long drive out of town another was injured by being delayed until twelve at aparty which the borrower said would break up at nine my best coachman became chilled

noneto attend the sacrament of the lord's supper who are in the knownindulgence of sin should he discover any immorality in a churchmember it is his business to inform his pastor who will call the

before a seeker is considered a fit subject by the leader to bepresented to his pastor as a candidate for the communion when anappearance of correct morality and pious feeling authorizes thismeasure he undergoes a private examination relative to his religionsviews arid wants should the seeker be a slave the minister requiresa certificate which may testify to the good character of the
