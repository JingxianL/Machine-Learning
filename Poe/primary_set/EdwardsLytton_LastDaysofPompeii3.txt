were indeed he unfortunate lone but it is well for her that those solemn caresto the dead which religion enjoins have hithertogreatly absorbed her attention from glaucus andherself and in the dimness of her senses shescarcely seems aware that glaucus is apprehendedand on the eve of trial when the funeral ritesare performed her apprehension will return andthen i fear me much that her friends will

be myproxy with the dead will he confess can henot be persuaded that in his delirium he struckthe blow to me it would give far greater safetythan even his death hem we must hazard

no and why hast thou hitherto concealed fromme this secret why hast thou waited till the eveof the athenian's condemnation before thou hastventured to tell me that arbaces is a murdererand having tarried so long why revealed thounow that knowledge because because stammered calenuscolouring and in confusionbecause interrupted arbaces with a gentlesmile and tapping the priest on the shoulder witha kindly and familiar gesture because my calenus see now i will read thy heart and explainpompeii its motives because thou didst wish thoroughlyto commit and entangle me in the trial so that imight have no loophole of escape that i mightstand firmly pledged to perjury and to malice aswell as to homicide that having myself whettedthe appetite of the populace to blood no wealthno power could prevent my becoming their victim and thou tallest me thy secret now ere thetrial be over and the innocent condemned toshew what a dexterous web of villany thy wordtomorrow could destroy to

singularprecision and dexterous rapidity of motionwhich we have before observed was peculiarto her had passed lightly along the peristylethreaded the opposite passage that led into thegarden and with a beating heart was aboutto proceed towards the gate when she suddenlyheard the sound of approaching steps and distinguishedthe dreaded voice of arbaces himselfshe paused for a moment in doubt andterror then suddenly it flashed across her recollectionthat there was another passage which waslittle used except for the admission of the fair partakersof the egyptian's secret revels and whichwound along the basement of that massive fabrictowards a door which also communicated withthe garden by good fortune it might be openat that thought she hastily retraced her stepsdescended the narrow stairs at the right and wassoon at the entrance of the passage alas thedoor at that entrance was closed and securedwhile she was yet assuring herself that it waspompeii indeed locked she heard behind her the voiceof calenus and a moment after that of arbacesin low reply she could not stay there theywere probably passing to that very door shesprang onward and felt herself in unknownground the air grew damp and chill this reassuredher she thought she might be amongthe cellars of the luxurious mansion or at leastin some rude spot not likely to be visited by itshaughty lord when again her quick ear caughtsteps and the sound of voices on on she turnedextending her arms which now frequentlyencountered pillars of thick and massive formwith a tact doubled in acuteness by her fearshe escaped these perils and continued her waythe air growing more and more damp as she proceeded yet still as she ever and anon paused forbreath she heard the advancing steps and theindistinct murmur of voices at length she wasabruptly stopped by a wall that seemed thelimit of her path was there no spot in whichshe could hide no aperture no cavity there the last days ofwas none she stopped and wrung her handsin despair then again nerved as the voicesneared upon her she hurried on by the side ofthe wall and coming suddenly against one ofthe sharp buttresses that here and there juttedboldly forth she fell to the ground thoughmuch bruised her senses did not leave hershe uttered no cry nay she hailed the accidentthat had led her to something like ascreen and creeping close up to the angleformed by the buttress so that on one side atleast she was sheltered from view she gatheredher slight and small form into its smallest compassand breathlessly awaited her fatemeanwhile arbaces and the priest were takingtheir way to that secret chamber whose storeswere so vaunted by the egyptian they were inavast subterranean atrium or hall the low roofwas supported by short thick pillars of an architecturefar remote fi'om the grecian graces ofthat luxuriant period the single and pale lampwhich arbaces bore shed but an imperfect raypompeii over the bare and rugged walls in which thehuge stones without cement were fitted curiouslyand uncouthly into each other the disturbedreptiles glared dully on the intruders and thencrept into the shadow of the wallscalenus shivered as he looked around andbreathed the damp unwholesome airyet said arbaces with a smile perceivinghis shudder it is these rude abodes that furnishthe luxuries of the halls above they are likethe labourers of the

struggled to the right of thesealcb the two comrades now directed their stepsthe gay glaucus will be lodged tomorrow inapartments not much dryer and far less spaciousthan this said calenus as they passed by thevery spot where completely wrapt in the shadowof the broad projecting buttress cowered the thessalianay but then he will have dry room andample enough in the arena on the following dayand to think continued arbaces slowly andvery deliberately to think that a word of thinecould save him and consign arbaces to hisdoom that word shall never be spoken saidcalenusright my calenus it never shall returnedarbaces familiarly leaning his arm on the priest'sshoulder and now halt we are at thedoorpompeii the light trembled against a small door deepset in the wall and guarded strongly by manyplates and bindings of iron that intersected therough and dark wood from his girdle arbacesnow drew a small ring holding three or fourshort but strong keys oh how beat the gripingheart of calenus

he spoken said hewith a loud exultant laugh and closed the doorupon the priestcalenus had been precipitated down severalsteps but not feeling at the moment the pain of the last days ofhis fall he sprung up again to the door andbeating at it fiercely with his clenched fist hecried aloud in what seemed more a beast's howlthan a human voice so keen was his agony anddespair oh release me release

desperate famine thyflesh from thy bones that so perishes the manwho threatened and could have undone arbaces farewelloh pity mercy inhuman villain was itfor this the rest of the sentence was lost to the ear ofarbaces as he passed backward along the dimpompeii hall a toad plump and bloated lay unmovingbefore his path the rays of the lamp fell uponits shaped hideousness and red upward eyearbaces turned aside that he might not harm itthou art loathsome and obscene he muttered but thou canst not injure me thereforethou art safe in my paththe cries of calenus dulled and choked by thebarrier that confined him yet faintly reached theear of the egyptian he paused and listenedintentlythis is unfortunate thought he for icannot sail till that voice is dumb for ever mystores and treasures lie not in

extendedarms along the pillared space until shehad gained the farther end of the hall and themouth of the passage that led to the upper airbut there she paused she felt that it would bemore safe to

on the third and last day of thetrial of glaucus and olynthus a few hours afterthe court had broke up and judgment been givena small party of the fashionable youth at pompeiiwere assembled round the fastidious board oflepidus so glaucus denies his crime to the last saidclodiusyes but the testimony of arbaces was convincing he saw the blow given answered lepiduswhat could have been the causewhy the priest was a gloomy and sullenfellow he probably rated glaucus soundly aboutthe last days ofhis gay life and gaming habits and ultimatelyswore he would not consent to his marriage withlone high words arose glaucus seems to havebeen full of the passionate god and struck insudden exasperation the excitement of winethe desperation of abrupt remorse brought on thedelirium under which he suffered for some days and i can readily imagine poor fellow that yetconfused by that delirium he is even now unconsciousof the crime he committed such atleast is the shrewd conjecture of arbaces whoseems to have been most kind and forbearing inhis testimonyyes he has made himself generally popularby it but in consideration of these extenuatingcircumstances the senate should have relaxed thesentenceand they would have done so but for thepeople but they were outrageous the priestshad spared no pains to excite them and theyimagined the ferocious brutes because glaucuswas a rich man and a gentleman that he waspompeii likely to escape and therefore they were inveterateagainst him and doubly resolved upon hissentence the senate did not dare refuse to striphim of the rights of citizenship and so

hisabsence the offence was venial and would meritbut a reprimand yet should lydia's letter containsomething more than what she had said should it speak of her imprisonment as he shrewdlyconjectured it

precaution to write ingreek the language of her childhood and whichalmost every italian of the higher ranks was thensupposed to know she carefully wound roundthe epistle the protecting thread and covered itsknot with wax and ere she placed it in the handsof sosia she thus addressed him sosia i am blind and in prison thou maystthink to deceive me thou mayst pretend only totake this letter to

goblet my good fellow said he to his companion it was a most awful judgment height it isnot bad that kid eh poor dear glaucus what a jaw the lion has too ah ah ah and sallust sobbed loudly the fit was stoppedby a counteraction of hiccupstake a cup of wine said the freedmana thought too cold but then how coldglaucus must be shut up the house tomorrownot a slave shall stir forth none of my peopleshall honour that cursed arena no noa cup of wine your grief distracts you bythe gods it does a piece of that cheesecakeit was at this auspicious moment that sosiawas admitted to the presence of the disconsolatecarouserho what art thoumerely a messenger to sallust i give himthis billet from a young lady there is no answerthat i know of may i withdraw the last days opthus said the discreet sosia keeping his facemuffled in his cloak and speaking with a feignedvoice so that he might not hereafter be recognisedby the gods a pimp unfeeling wretchdo you not see my sorrows go and thecurses of pandarus with you sosia lost not a moment in retiring will you read the letter sallust said thefreedmanletter which letter said the epicurereeling for he began to see double a curse onthese wenches

fairly on his breastthey bore him off to his cubiculum still mutteringlamentations for glaucus and imprecations onthe unfeeling invitations of ladies of pleasurepompeii meanwhile sosia strode indignantly homewardpimp indeed quoth he to himself pimp a scurvytongued fellow that sallust had ibeen called knave or thief i could have forgivenit but pimp faugh there is something in theword which the toughest stomach in the worldwould rise against a knave is a knave for hisown pleasure and a thief a thief for his ownprofit and there is something honourable andphilosophical in being a rascal for one's own sake that is doing things upon principle upon a grandscale but a pimp is a thing that defiles itselffor another a pipkin that is put on the fire foranother man's pottage a napkin that everyguest wipes his hands upon and the scullionsays by your leave to a pimp i wouldrather he had called me parricide but the manwas drunk and did not know what he said andbesides i disguised myself

goddessverona i shall be a freedman soon and theni should like to see who'll call me pimp unless indeed he pay me pretty handsomelyfor it while sosia was soliloquising in this highmindedand generous vein his path lay along a narrowlane that led towards the amphitheatre and itsadjacent palaces suddenly as he turned a sharpcorner he found himself in the midst of a considerablecrowd men women and childrenall were hurrying on laughing talking gesticulating and ere he was aware of it the worthysosia was borne away with the noisy streamwhat now he asked of his nearest neighboura young artificer

the last days ofnote to book iva page we care not for gods up above us we know there's no god for this earth boys the doctrines of epicurus himself are pure and simple farfrom denying the existence of diviner powers villeins the defenderand explainer of his philosophy in cicero's dialogue on thenature of the gods asserts that epicurus was the first whosaw that there were gods from the impression which nature herselfmakes on the minds of all men he imagined the belief ofthe deity to be an innate or antecedent notion roxfipis of themind a doctrine of which modern metaphysicians certainly notepicurean have largely availed themselves he believed thatworship was due to the divine powers from the veneration whichfelicity and excellence command and not from any dread of theirvengeance or awe of their power a sublime and fearless philosophysuitable perhaps to half a dozen great and refined spiritsbut which would present no check to the passions of the mass ofmankind according to him the gods were far too agreeablyemployed in contemplating their own happiness to troubletheir heads about the sorrows and the joys the quarrels andthe cares the petty and transitory affairs of man for thisearth they were unsympathising abstractions wrapt up in majesty divinecan they regard on what we dine cotta who in the dialogue referred to attacks the philosophyof epicurus with great pleasantry and considerable though notpompeii uniform success draws the evident and practical corollary fromthe theory that asserts the noninterference of the gods howsays he can there be sanctity if the gods regard not humanaffairs if the deity shew no benevolence to man let us dismisshim at once why should i entreat him to be propitious hecannot be propitious since according to you favour and benevolenceare only the effects of imbecility cotta indeed quotesfrom poisonous de natura decorum to prove that epicurus didnot really believe in the existence of a god but that his concessionof a being wholly nugatory was merely a precautionagainst accusations of atheism epicurus could not be such afool says cotta as sincerely to believe that a deity has themembers of a man without the power to use them a thin pellucidityregarding no one and doing nothing and whether thisbetrue or false concerning epicurus it is certain that to alleffects and purposes his later disciples were but refining atheiststhe sentiments uttered in the song in the text are preciselythose professed in sober prose by the graceful philosophers of thegarden who as they had wholly perverted the morals of

to them the giant nigerthe old man sat down again and covered hisface the fray for the moment was indifferent tohim lydon was not one of the combatants yetyet the thought flashed across him the fraywas indeed of deadly interest the first who fellwas to make way for lydon he started upand bent down with straining eyes and claspedhands to view the encounterthe first interest was attracted towards the the last days ofcombat of niger with sporus for this species ofcontest from the fatal result which usually attendedit and from the great science it requiredin either antagonist was always peculiarly invitingto the spectatorsthey stood at a considerable distance from eachother the singular helmet which sporus adorethe visor of which was down concealed his face but the features of niger attracted a fearful anduniversal interest from their compressed and vigilantferocity thus they stood for some momentseach eyeing each until sporus began slowly andwith great caution to advance holding his swordpointed like a modern fencer's at the breast of hisfoe niger retreated as his antagonist advancedgathering up his net with his right hand andnever taking his small glittering eye from themovements of the swordsman suddenly whensporus had approached nearly at arm's length theretiarius threw himself forward and cast his neta quick inflection of body saved the gladiatorfrom the deadly snare he uttered a sharp cry ofpompeii joy and rage and rushed upon niger but nigerhad already drawn in his net thrown it acrosshis shoulders and now fled round the lists with aswiftness which the sector in vain endeavouredto equal the people laughed and shouted aloudto see the ineffectual efforts of the broadshoulderedgladiator to overtake the flying giant when atthat moment their attention was turned fromthese to the two roman combatantsthey had placed themselves at the onset face toface at the distance of modern fencers from eachother but the extreme caution which both evincedat first had prevented any warmth of engagementand allowed the spectators full leisure to interestthemselves in the battle between sporus and hisfoe but the romans were now heated into fulland fierce encounter
