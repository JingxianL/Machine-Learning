bravowho were abroad to breathe the soft air of the nightor to enter into the pleasures of the piazzawhen within the dimmer and broken light of thecourt jacopo paused evidently to scan the personsof those it contained it is to be presumed he sawno reason to delay for with a secret sign to hiscompanion to follow he crossed the area andmounted the wellknown steps down which the headof the falter had rolled and which from the statueson the summit is called the giant s stairs thecelebrated mouths of the lions were passed and theywere walking swiftly along the open gallery whenthey encountered a halberdier of the ducal guardwho comes demanded the mercenary throwingforward his long and dangerous weaponfriends to the state and to st marknone pass at this hour without the wordjacopo motioned to antonio to stand fast whilehe drew nearer to the halberdier and whisperedthe weapon was instantly thrown up and the sentinelagain paced the long gallery with practised indifferencethe way was no sooner cleared thanthey proceeded antonio not a little amazed atwhat he had already seen eagerly followed his guidefor his heart began to beat high with an excitingbut undefined hope he was not so ignorant of humanaffairs as to require to be told that those whoruled would some time concede that in secret whichpolicy forbade them to yield openly full thereforeof the expectation of being ushered into the presenceof the doge himself and of having his childrestored to his arms the old man stepped lightlyalong the gloomy gallery and darling through anentrance at the heels of jacopo he found himselfat the foot of another flight of massive steps theroute now became confused to the fisherman forquitting the more public dormitories of the palace hiscompanion held his way by a secret door throughthe bravo many dimly lighted and obscure passages theyascended and descended frequently as often quittingor entering rooms of but ordinary dimensions anddecorations until the head of antonio was completelyturned and he no longer knew the general directionof their course at length they stopped in an apartmentof inferior ornaments and of a dusky colorwhich the feeble light rendered still more gloomythou art well acquainted with the dwelling ofour prince said the fisherman when his companionenabled him to speak by checking his swift movements the oldest gondolier of venice is notmore ready on the canals than thou appeared to beamoner these galleries and corridorstis my business to bring thee hither and whati am to do i endeavor to do well antonio thouart a man that feareth not to

remnant of hishair as men of his class prepare themselves for thepresence of their superiors and it would not bedecent in an humble fisherman to refuse them thethe bravo opportunity it would be better however if therewere less force used here in venice in a matter ofsimple right and wrong but the great love to showtheir power and the weak must submit twe shall see answered ja cxipo who hadmanifested no emotion during the abortive attemptof the other to retirea profound stillness succeeded the halberdiersmaintained their rigid attitudes within the shadowof the wall looking like two insensible statues in theattire and armor of the age while jacopo and hiscompanion occupied the centre of the room withscarcely more of the appearance of consciousnessand animation it may be well to explain here tothe reader some of the peculiar machinery of thestate in the country of which we write and whichis connected with the scene that is about to follow for the name of a republic a word which if it meananything strictly implies the representation and supremacyof the general interests but which has sofrequently been prostituted to the protection andmonopolies of privileged classes may have inducedhim to believe that there was at least a resemblancebetween the outlines of that government and themore just because more popular institutions of hisown countryin an age when rulers were profane enough toassert and the ruled weak enough to allow that theright of a man to govern his fellows was a directgift from god a departure from the bold and selfishprinciple though it were only in profession wasthought sufficient to give a character of freedomand common sense to the polity of a nation thisbelief is not without some justification since it establishesin theory at least the foundations of governmenton a base sufficiently different from thatwhich supposes all power to be the property of oneand that one to be the representative of the faultlessvol i p the bravoand omnipotent ruler of the universe with thefirst of these principles we have nothing to do exceptit be to add that there are propositions so inherentlyfalse that they only require to be fairly statedto produce their own refutation but our subject necessarilydraws us into a short digression on theerrors of the second as they existed in veniceit is probable that when the patricians of stmark created a community of political rights intheir own body they believed their state had doneall that was necessary to merit the high and generoustitle it assumed they had innovated on a generallyreceived principle and they cannot claim the distinctionof being either the first or the last whohave imagined that to take the incipient steps in politicalimprovement is at once to reach the goal ofperfection venice had no doctrine of divine rightand as her prince was little more than a pageantshe boldly laid claim to be called a republic shebelieved that a representation of the most prominentand brilliant interests in society was the paramountobject of government and faithful to the seductivebut dangerous error she mistook to the last collectivepower for social happinessit may be taken as a governing principle in allcivil relations that the strong will grow strongerand the feeble more weak until the first become unfitto rule or the last unable to endure in this importanttruth is contained the secret of the downfallof all those states which have crumbled beneath theweight of their own abuses it teaches the necessityof widening the foundations of society until the baseshall have a breadth capable of securing the justrepresentation of every interest without which thesocial machine is liable to interruption from its ownmovement and eventually to destruction from itsown excessesvenice though ambitious and tenacious of thethe bravo name of a republic was in truth a narrow a vulgarand an exceedingly heartless oligarchy to theformer title she had no other claim than her denialof the naked principle already mentioned while herpractice is liable to the reproach of the two latterin the unmanly and narrow character of its exclusionin every act of her foreign policy and inevery measure of her internal police an aristocracymust ever want the high personal feeling whichoften tempers despotism by the qualities of thechief or the generous and human impulses of apopular rule it has the merit of substituting thingsfor men it is true but unhappily it substitutes thethings of a few men for those of the whole it partakesand it always has partaken though necessarilytempered by circumstances and the opinions ofdifferent ages of the selfishness of all corporationsin which the responsibility of the individual whilehis acts are professedly submitted to the temporizingexpedients of a collective interest is lost in the subdivisionof numbers at the period of which wewrite italy had several of these selfstyled commonwealthsin not one of which however was thereever a fair and just confiding of power to the bodyof the people though perhaps there is not one thathas not been cited sooner or later in proof of theinability of man to govern himself in order todemonstrate the fallacy of a reasoning which is sofond of predicting the downfall of our own liberal systemsupported by examples drawn from transatlanticstates of the middle ages it is necessary only to recounthere a little in detail the forms in which powerwas obtained and exercised in the most importantof them alldistinctions in rank as separated entirely fromthe will of the nation formed the basis of venetianpolity authority though divided was not less abirthright than in those governments in which it was the bravoopenly avowed to be a dispensation of providencethe patrician order had its high and exclusive privilegeswhich were guarded and maintained with amost selfish and engrossing spirit he who wasnot born to govern had little hope of ever enteringinto the possession of his natural rights while hewho was by the intervention of chance mightwield a power of the most fearful and despoticcharacter at a certain age all of senatorial rankfor by a specious fallacy nobility did not take itsusual appellations were admitted into the councilsof the nation the names of the leading familieswere inscribed in a register which was well entitledthe golden book and he who enjoyed the envieddistinction of having an ancestor thus enrolledcould with a few exceptions such as that named inthe case of don camillo present himself in thesenate and lay claim to the honors of the hornedbonnet neither our limits nor our object willpermit a digression of sufficient length to point outthe whole of the leading features of a system so viciousand which was perhaps only rendered tolerableto those it governed by the extraneous contributionsof captured and subsidiary provinces onwhich in truth as in all cases of metropolitan rulethe oppression weighed most grievously thereader will at once see that the very reason whythe despotism of the selfstyled republic was tolerableto its own citizens was but another cause of itseventual destructionas the senate became too numerous to conductwith sufficient secrecy and dispatch the affairs of astate that pursued a policy alike tortuous and complicatedthe most general of its important interestswere intrusted to a council composed of three hundredof its members in order to avoid the publicityand delay of a body large even as this a secondselection was made which was known as the countbravo cil of ten and to which much of the executivepower that aristocratical jealousy withheld fromthe titular chief of the state was confided tothis point the political economy of the venetian republichowever faulty had at least some merit forsimplicity and frankness the ostensible agents ofthe administration were known arid though all realresponsibility to the nation was lost in the superiorinfluence and narrow policy of the patricians therulers could not entirely escape from the odium thatpublic opinion might attach to their unjust or illegalproceedings but a state whose prosperity waschiefly founded on the contribution and support ofdependants and whose existence was equally menacedby its own false principles and by the growthof other and neighboring powers had need of a stillmore efficient body in the absence of that executivewhich its own republican pretensions denied tovenice a political inquisition which came intimeto be one of the most fearful engines of policeever known was the consequence an authorityas irresponsible as it was absolute was periodical vconfided to another and still smaller body whichmet and exercised its despotic and secret functionsunder the name of the council of three thechoice of these temporary rulers was decided bvlot and in a manner that prevented the result frombeing known to any but to their own number andto a few of the most confidential of the more permanentofficers of the government thus thereexisted at all times in the heart of venice a mysteriousand despotic power that was wielded bymen who moved in society unknown and apparentlysurrounded by all the ordinary charities of life but which in truth was influenced by a set of politicalmaxims that were perhaps as ruthless as tyrannicand as selfish as ever were invented by the evilingenuity of man it was in short a power thatp tiie bravocould only be intrusted without abuse to infalliblevirtue and infinite intelligence using the terms in asense limited by human means and yet it was hereconfided to men whose title was founded on thedouble accident of birth and the colors of ballsand by whom it was wielded without even thecheck of publicitythe council of three met in secret ordinarilyissued its decrees without communicating with anyother body and had them enforced with a fearfulnessof mystery and a suddenness of executionthat resembled the blows of fate the doge himselfwas not superior to its authority nor protected fromits decisions while it has been known that one of theprivileged three has been denounced by his companionsthere is still in existence a long list of thestate maxims which this secret tribunal recognizedas its rule of conduct and it is not saying too muchto affirm that they set at defiance every other considerationbut expediency all the recognized lawsof god and every principle of justice which is esteemedamong men the advances of the humanintellect supported by the means of publicity maytemper the exercise of a similar irresponsible powerin our own age but in no country has this substitutionof a soulless corporation for an elective representationbeen made in which a system of rule hasnot been established that sets at naught the laws ofnatural justice and the rights of the citizen anypretension to the contrary by placing professionin opposition to practice is only adding hypocrisyto usurpationit appears to be an unavoidable general consequencethat abuses should follow when pow r er is exercisedby a permanent and irresponsible bodyfrom whom there is no appeal when this poweris secretly exercised the abuses become still moregrave it is also worthy of remark that in the nathebravo tons which submit or have submitted to these undueand dangerous influences the pretensions tojustice and generosity are of the most exaggeratedcharacter for while the fearless democrat ventshis personal complaints aloud and the voice of thesubject of professed despotism is smothered entirelynecessity itself dictates to the oligarchy the policyof seemliness as one of the conditions of his ownsafety thus venice prided herself on the justiceof st mark and few states maintained a greatershow or put forth a more lofty claim to the possessionof the sacred quality than that whose realmaxims of government were veiled in a mysterythat even the loose morality of the age exactedchapter xii a power that if but namedin casual converse be it where it

simple apprehension was far fromcomprehending the extent or the nature of functionsthat equally took cognizance of the most importantinterests of the republic and of the moretrifling concerns of a

furniture had the samemelancholy covering as the w r alls in the angles ofthe room there were projecting closets which mighthave been what they seemed or merely passagesinto the other apartments of the palace all thedoors were concealed from casual observation bythe hangings which gave one general and chillingaspect of gloom to the whole scene on the side ofthe room opposite to that on which

you caution me so muchnot to deal with them but we of the lagunes arenot afraid to say what we have seen and done formost of our business is with the winds and waveswhich take their orders from god himself thereis a tradition signori among us fishermen that intimespast one of our body brought up from the baythe ring with which the doge is accustomed to marrythe adriatic a jewel of that value was of littleuse to one who casts his nets daily for bread and oiland he brought it to the doge as became a fishermaninto whose hands the saints had thrown a prizeto which he had no title as it were to prove his honestythis act of our companion is much spokenof on the lagunes and at the lido and it is saidthere is a noble painting done by some of our venetianmasters in the halls of the palace which tellsthe story as it happened showing the prince on histhrone and the lucky fisherman with his naked legsrendering back to his highness that which had beenlost i hope there is foundation for this
