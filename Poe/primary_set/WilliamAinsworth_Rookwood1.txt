withthe great grey glassy eyespeter bradley of rosewood in the countyof york where he had exercised the vocation ofsexton for the best part of a life already drawnout to the full span ordinarily allotted to mortalitywas one of those odd grotesque bizarrecaricatures of humanity which it occasionallydelighteth our inimitable george cruikshank tolimn so attenuated in the region of the legsand

claws after all his eyeswere his most remarkable feature like thetoad ugly and venemous he bore a preciousjewel in his head and like that noxiousreptile his eyes were large lambent andluminous though cold as the fire of an ignisfatuus and grey as the slaty hue of earliestdaybreak and then his laugh that hollowchuckling laugh distinguishable from all otherlaughter by an occasional wheezing choke whichthreatened during its paroxysm to terminate theexistence and merriment of the cachinnatorone and the same time this laugh had besidessomething so horrible about it that thoughseldom heard it

ofrook wood them all could do in illustrating the fossil tusk ofa mammoth the giant jaw of the mastodon orother incomprehensible remnant of the extinctcreation of the antediluvian worldsome other peculiarities had peter bradleywhich we shall leave to be developed in thecourse of our story contenting ourselves withthe mention of one faculty which he wassupposed to enjoy the possession of which madehim an object of no little apprehension to thehabitants of rosewood and the neighbourhood this was the power of predicting theapproach of death how he acquired thisfaculty was matter of abundant conjecture andhad never been satisfactorily explained or ratherthe explanations offered had left people more inthe dark than before some said that long practiceenabled him to detect a norihund subject

knowledge from such unholy association and consequently was little betterthan a wizard or sorcerer and ought to betreated as such and burnt at the stake or atleast ducked in a blanket that his lone andlong midnight vigils in the church porchcould be for no good or christianlike purpose nay they even went on to say that hehad entered into a compact with the king ofterrors to furnish food for his

whereon to found thoseclaims it may satisfy you and other credulouspeople as myself for instance that such amarriage hath taken place but it is scarce likelyto meet with implicit belief with others nor whatis more to obtain for thee the broad lands andthe proud name of rosewood and after alltis the union you mist establish beyond adoubt between sir piers and your mother forit is possible at least there may be those will say nookwoodso that she was a married woman and yet nowife to sir piersthey will not repeat the assertion in myhearing why say this to me i do not say so nor do i think so all ifear is that sir piers precautions were so welltaken that you may never be able to adduceproof positive that such a marriage did existbut we may disprove any other allegedalliance and if sir piers did act with so muchcaution why left he this speaking evidencebehind to point like an index to the secret it is not easy to account for it and yet thechances were against the occurrence of an eventlike the present looking more narrowly at thewristjoint it would appear as if he had reallyintended to prevent such a discovery but haddesisted when his work was partially completedfor sir piers was ever apt to act one momentand repent of it the next and his allowing thatring to remain most likely proceeded from somepassing feeling of remorse besides as i saidrookwood before he probably did not calculate upon such acontingency as this he took care nobody shouldsee this vault without his permission during hislifetime i have not had the keys myself beforeyesterday these fourandtwenty years althoughhe has often visited the place during thatperiodindeeday i have seen him watched him whenhe thought no human eye beheld him hitherwould he often steal at night and fasten himselfwithin with what intent you shall hear hush was not that afootstep i hear nothing proceedthe sexton gave a preparatory coughone night happening to be within thechurch porch as he entered i followed himunobserved he descended to the vault leavingthe door ajar i crept softly down the stepsrookwoodand there i saw him standing even where nowthou stances beside an open coffinthat ay that he then unscrewed the lidhe was gazing on the dead within his backwas towards me i could not see his facebut i heard his groans his convulsive sobs hisheartrending cries if i ever pitied humanbeing i could have pitied sir piersand yet thou doubtless his having a weightof secret sin upon his soul thou thickest hishands were not embrued in blood said i so i never doubted it you askedme if i had seen the deed done i saw her uponher deathbed there were no indications of aviolent end upon her person further thanexist upon it now as thou hast seen herno bruise no blow no wound and yet idoubt not that she came to that end untimelydoubt i she was his wife no i doubt itnot and yet i saw no ceremony take place rook wood sheard no priest's blessing pronounced upon themsaw no ring placed upon her finger nordreamed of such a thing until now howbeitthere is one living can make doubts certaintiesbut to return to sir piers there he stoodmaking lamentation moaning and beating hisbreast like one distracted tearing his hair andinvoking destruction upon himself until atlength the violence of the fit worked its own cureand he became calmer he then bent himselfover her body and kissed its cold lips as reverentlyand tenderly as if she had been his brideasleep beside himand this you witnessed i did his next proceeding was to pray byher side long and fervently and seeing him ariseas if with the intention of departing i was aboutto retreat from my hidingplace when my attentionwas arrested by his voice at first i thoughthe had perceived me and glad was i wheni found myself mistaken for i make no doubthad he discovered me spying upon his privacyvol i e rook woodbut that he would in his wrath have dispatchedme outright he was talking to himself iventured once more to look round his face wasthen towards the door and as i looked throughthe chink at the opening i could see the fierceglances of lies eyes thine bum with a like fire atthis moment that alone would prove thou art thyfather's son and a true rosewood well hisglances flew like flashes of lightning round thevault and he stood with one foot upon that oldmarble monument and his arms spread out as ifabout to strike the senseless statue and i couldhear that he was cursing the warrior within thetomb his words still ring in my ears and icould almost fancy i heard the frenzied fearfultone in which he pronounced them thou shalthear it for each word dwells upon my memoryfirst of an accursed race he cried thou parentsource from whence that stream of hot andtainted blood which hath raged like lava withinthe veins of thy sons for generation after generationsucceeding thee had its rise whatbook wood hindered me from pouring out upon thy tomb arich libation of that blood as an offering tothy manes and to the infernal gods to whomthou hast sold thyself and haply all thy race nothing should hinder me did i deem thatit would act as an expiation of my offences as anatonement of my guilt but would it cleanseand purify my soul would it not deepen myguilt darken my doom would it not plungeme beyond redemption to instant perdition ifeel that such an act would do so yet would iask of thee wherefore is it that this heritage ofcrime hath

have heard that none but those of thehouse of rosewood their wives and daughtersare ever buried within that vault it hath everbeen the rule for thy first objection repliedsir piers if there be scandal it will attach tome i will bear its brunt for the second it ismy pleasure to break the rule in favour of thydaughter who hath ever been dear to me as awife and who is there shall say me nay i

icould save it at least from that such thingshave been done answered i for i preservedmy composure and was not like him carriedaway by my grief they have answered he but it is too late to think of it now whereshould i find one who could embalm her dearbody and he burst into a fresh torrent of tearsi once knew of such a one i replied agipsy woman who professed that art and isaccounted an adept

and she readily consented to accompanyme to the hall sir piers was impatient formy return he bound us by a terrible oath notto divulge during his lifetime what was aboutto take place i hesitated not to take it for tospeak truth and whatever misgivings i mighthave as to susan s end i had no desire to betraythee barbara likewise agreed she listened tohis promises she accepted his offersthere was a moaning sound at that momentheard within the vault and the dog whined inthe corner whither he had crept the sexton inrook wood his own mind attributed the noise to the coldcurrent of air he had before perceived upon hischeek and which now breathed upon him againhe noticed the interruption only with a slightinvoluntary shudder and proceeded barbara lovel had brought with her a boxof spices and gums and fragrant herbs besidessome curiouslyfashioned instruments of which icaught a glimpse of odd shape and manufactureshe asked for a chafing dish and charcoal shemade her preparations had linen fetched for herand basons and i know not what she theninsisted upon being left alone sir piers wouldfain have remained in the room but she wouldnot hear of it and locked the door silently shewent to work and as we kept watch withoutwe perceived a rich steam issue from out thecrevices of the door sir piers thought someaccident had happened and was about to forcean entrance when he was checked in his intentby the loud voice of barbara angrily commandinghin to desist upon pain of her instant lockwooddeparture and the leaving her work unfinishedso he made no further attempt and at nightfallbarbara came forth looking as white as a shroudshe took the key from out the door delivered it tosir piers and asked to have an interview with himalone their conference was long and barbaradeparted i have reason to think not dissatisfiedwith sir piers bounty but this i only conjecturenever having met or spoken with her sincethat night presently the coffin was brought we were admitted to the room the windows werethrown wide open the steam had evaporated susan was as thou hast seen her she was laidout placed within the shell and before all wasmade fast sir piers with a trembling hand cutoffone long lock from her black hair which hesaid he would keep to his dying day and i makeno doubt he kept his word that night a drearyand a dark one twas we bore our

with youyou'll excuse my disputing the point for thesake of conversation though i'm not much of acasuist as you perceive no great hand atsettling a case of conscience you grant that animpression is made but deny that that impressionis favourable to true religion then comesthe point upon which we don't all agree exactlynamely what is the nature of true religion if it be one part of true religion to have thefear of death constantly before our eyes as aninducement to lead virtuous lives then surelythe more forcibly it is presented the better andthe solemn shows of our church are highly efficaciousand allow me to say doctor withdeference there are i speak from my ownrookwood knowledge thousands ay tens of thousandsamong the poorer classes of my own countrymento whom no other
