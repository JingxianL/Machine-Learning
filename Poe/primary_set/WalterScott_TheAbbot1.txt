favourthat you disapprove of the numerousretrenchments and alterations which i havebeen under the necessity of making on themanuscript of your friend the benedictine and i willingly make you the mediumof apology to many who have honouredme more than i deserveau introductory epistlei admit that my retrenchments have beennumerous and leave gaps in the storywhich in your original manuscript wouldhave run well nigh to a fourth volume asmy printer assures me i am sensible besidesthat in consequence of the liberty ofcurtailment you have allowed m e some partsof the story have been huddled up withoutthe necessary details but after all it isbetter that the travellers should have to stepover a drain than to wade through a morass that the reader should have to supposewhat may easily be inferred than beobliged to creep through pages of dull explanationi have struck out for examplethe whole machinery of the white ladyand the poetry by which it is so ably supportedin the original

wasonce the most powerful and animating principlein europe with the exception of thatof the reformation by which it was successfullyopposedyou rightly observe that these retrenchmentshave rendered the title no longer applicableto the subject and that some otherwould have been more suitable to the workin its present state than that of the abbotwho made so much greater figure in theoriginal and for whom your friend the benedictineseems to have inspired you witha sympathetic respect i must plead guiltyto this accusation observing at the sametime in manner of extenuation that thoughthe objection

otherwise as happyas mutual affection could render it thefirst of these was indeed the common calamityof scotland being the distracted stateof that unhappy country where every man'ssword was directed against his neighbour'sbosom glendinning had proved what murrayexpected of him a steady friend strongin battle and wise in counsel adhering tohim from motives of gratitude in situationswhere by his

knighthood was perpetually sumtheabbot money to attend his patron on distant expeditionsor on perilous enterprizes or toassist him with his counsel in the doubtfulintrigues of a half barbarous court he wasthus frequently and for a long space absentfrom his castle and from his lady and tothis ground of regret we must add thattheir union had produced no children tooccupy the attention of the lady of while she was thus deprived of herhusband's domestic societyon such occasions she lived almost entirelysecluded from the world within thewalls of her paternal mansion visitingamongst neighbours was a matter entirelyout of the question unless on occasion ofsolemn festival and then it was chieflyconfined to near kindred of these thelady of avenel had none who survivedand the dames of the neighbouring baronsaffected to regard her less as the heiress ofthe house of avenel than as the wife of apeasant the son of a churchvassal raised the abbotup to mushroom eminence by the capriciousfavour of murraythis pride of ancestry which rankled inthe bosom of the more ancient gentry wasmore openly expressed by their ladies andwas moreover embittered not a little bythe political feuds of the time for most ofthe southron chiefs were friends to the authorityof the queen and very jealous ofthe power of murray the castle of was therefore on all these accounts asmelancholy and solitary a residence for itslady as could well be imagined still ithad the essential recommendation of greatsecurity the reader knows that the fortresswas built upon an islet in a smalllake and was only accessible by a causewayintersected by a double ditch defendedby two drawbridges so that without artilleryit might in these days be consideredas impregnable it was only necessarytherefore to secure against surprise andthe service of six able men within the castheabbot tie was sufficient for that purpose ifmore serious danger threatened an amplegarrison was supplied by the male inhabitantsof a little hamlet which under theauspices of halbert glendinning had arisenon a small piece of level ground betwixtthe lake and the hill nearly adjoiningto the spot where the causeway joined themainland the lord of avenel had foundit an easy matter to get inhabitants as hewas not only a kind and beneficent overlordbut well qualified both by his experiencein armes his high character for wisdomand integrity and his favour with the powerfulearl of murray to protect and defendthose who dwelt under his banner in leavinghis castle for any length of time hehad therefore the consolation to reflectthat this village afforded on the slightestnotice a band of thirty stout men whichwas more than sufficient for its defence while the families of the villagers as wasusual on such occasions fled to the recessesof the mountains drove their cattle to the the abbotsame places of shelter and left the enemyto work their will on their miserable cottagesone guest only resided generally if

that which concerned his religious professionmade his presence rather add tothan diminish the gloom which hung overthe castle of avenel to superintend thetasks of her numerous female domesticswas the principal part of the lady's dailyemployment her spindle and distaff herbible and a solitary walk upon the battlementsof the castle or upon the causewayor occasionally but more seldom upon thebanks of the little lake consumed the restof th day but so great was the insecurityof the period that when she ventureda the abbotto extend her walk beyond the hamlet thewarder on the watchtower was directed tokeep a sharp outlook in every directionand four or five men held themselves inreadiness to mount and sally forth fromthe village at the slightest appearance ofalarmthus stood affairs at the castle whenafter an absence of several weeks theknight of avenel which was now the titlemost frequently given to sir halbert glendiningwas daily expected to return homeday after day however passed away andhe returned not letters in those days wererarely written and the knight must haveresorted to a secretary to express his intentionsin that manner besides intercourseof all kinds was precarious and unsafe andno man cared to give any public intimationof the time and direction of a journey sinceit was always likely he might in that casemeet with more enemies than friends uponthe road the precise day therefore ofthe abbot sir halbert's return was not fixed but thatwhich his lady's fond expectation had calculatedupon in her own mind was longsince passed and hope delayed began tomake the heart sickit was upon the evening of a sultry summer'sday when the sun was half sunk behindthe distant western mountains of lauderdalethat the lady took her solitarywalk on the battlements of a range ofbuildings which formed the front of thecastle where a flat roof of flagstones presenteda broad and convenient promenadethe level surface of the lake undisturbedexcept by the occasional dipping of a tealduckor coot was gilded with the beamsof the setting luminary and reflected as ifin a golden mirror the hills amongst whichit lay embosomed the scene otherwiseso lonely was occasionally enlivened bythe voices of the children in the villagewhich softened by distance reached theear of the lady in her solitary walk or bythe distant call of the herdsman as he the abbotguided his cattle from the glen in whichthey had pastured all day to place themin greater security for the night in theimmediate vicinity of the village thedeep lowing of the cows seemed to demandthe attendance of the milkmaidenswho singing shrilly and merrily strolledforth each with her pail on her head to attendto the duty of the evening the ladyof avenel looked and listened the soundswhich she heard reminded her of formerdays when her most important employmentas well as her greatest delight wasto assist dame glendinning and tibi racketin milking the cows at glendearg thethought was fraught with melancholyc why was i not she said the peasantgirl which in all men's eyes i seemedto be halbert and i had then spent ourlife peacefully in his native glen undisturbedby the phantoms either of fear orof ambition his greatest pride had thenbeen to shew the fairest herd in the halidome his greatest danger to repel somethe abbot pilfering snatcher from the border andthe utmost distance which would have dividedus would have been the chase ofsome outlying deer but alas what availsthe blood which halbert has shed and thedangers which he encounters to support aname and rank dear to him because he hasit from me but which we shall never transmitto our posterity with me the nameof avenel must expireshe sighed as these reflections arose andlooking towards the shore of the lake hereye was attracted by a groupe of childrenof various ages assembled to see a littleship constructed by some village artist performits first voyage on the water it waslaunched amid the shouts of tiny voices andthe clapping of little hands and shot bravelyforth on its voyage with a favouringwind which promised to carry it to theother side of the lake some of the biggerboys ran round to receive and secure it onthe farther shore trying their speed againsteach other as they sprang like young fawnsj the abbotalong the shingly verge of the lake therest for whom such a journey seemed tooarduous remained watching the motions ofthe fairy vessel from the spot where it hadbeen launched the sight of their sportspressed on the mind of the childless ladyof avenel why are none of these prattlers mine she continued pursuing the tenor of hermelancholy reflections their parents canscarce find them in the coarsest food andi who could nurse them in plenty i amdoomed never to hear a child call me motherthe thought sunk on her heart with abitterness which resembled envy so deeplyis the desire of offspring implanted in thefemale breast she pressed her hands togetheras if she was wringing them in theextremity of her desolate feeling as onewhom heaven had written childless alarge staghound of the greyhound speciesapproached at this moment and attractedperhaps by the gesture licked her handsthe abbot and pressed his large head against themhe obtained the desired caress in returnbut still the sad impression remainedwolf she said as if the animal couldhave understood her complaints thou arta noble and beautiful animal but alas i thelove and affection that i long to bestow isof a quality higher than can fall to thyshare though i love thee muchand as if she were apologizing to wolffor withholding from him any part of herregard she caressed his proud head andcrest while looking in her eyes he seemedto ask her what she wanted or what hecould do to shew his attachment at thismoment a shriek of distress was heard onthe shore from the playful groupe whichhad been lately so jovial the lady lookedand saw the cause with great agonythe little ship the object of the children'sdelighted attention had stuck amongsome tufts of the plant which bears the laterallythat marked a little shoal in thelake about an arrowflight from the shore the abbota hardy little boy who had taken thelead in the race round the margin of thelake did not hesitate a moment to strip offhis wyliecoats plunge into the water andswim towards the object of their commonsolicitude the first movement of the ladywas to call for help but she observed thatthe boy swam strongly and fearlessly andas she saw that one or two villagers whowere distant spectators of the incidentseemed to give themselves no uneasinesson his account she supposed that he wasaccustomed to the exercise and that therewas no danger but whether in swimmingthe boy had struck his breast against asunken rock or whether he was suddenlytaken with the cramp or whether he hadovercalculated his own strength it so happenedthat when he had disembarrassedthe little plaything from the flags in whichit was entangled and sent it forward on itscourse he had scarce swam a few yards inhis way to the shore than he raised himselfsuddenly from the water and screamedthe abbot aloud clapping his hands at the same timewith an expression of fear and painthe lady of avenel instantly takingthe alarm called hastily to the attendantsto get the boat ready but this was anaffair of some time the only boat permittedto be used on the lake was mooredwithin the second cut which intersected thecanal and it was several minutes ere it couldbe unmoored and got under way meantimethe lady of avenel with agonizinganxiety saw that the efforts which the poorboy made to keep himself afloat were nowexchanged for a faint struggling whichwould soon have been over but for aidequally prompt and unhoped for wolfwho like some of that large species of a practised waterdog had markedthe object of her anxiety and quittinghis mistress's side had sought the nearestpoint from which he could with safety plungeinto the lake with the wonderful instinctwhich these noble animals have so often displayedin the like circumstances he swamstraight to the spot where his assistance was the abbotso much wanted and seizing the child's in his mouth he not only kept himafloat but towed him towards the causewaythe boat having put off with a coupleof men met the dog halfway and relievedhim of his burthen they landed on thecauseway close by the entrance to the castlewith their yet lifeless burthen and weremet at the entrance of the gate by the ladyof avenel attended by one or two of hermaidens eagerly waiting to administer assistanceto the suffererhe was borne into the castle depositedupon a bed and every mode of recovery resortedto which the knowledge of the timesand the skill of henry warden who professedsome medical knowledge could dictatefor some time it was all in vainand the lady watched with unspeakableearnestness the pallid countenance of thebeautiful child he seemed about ten yearsold his dress was of the meanest sort buthis long curled hair and the noble cast ofhis features partook not of that povertythe abbor of appearance the proudest noble in scotlandmight have been yet prouder could hehave called that child his heir while withbreathless anxiety the lady of avenel gazedon his wellformed and expressive featuresa slight shade of colour returned graduallyto the cheek suspended animationbecame restored by degrees the child sighdeeplyopened his eyes which to the humancountenance produces the effect oflight upon the natural landscape stretchedhis arms towards the lady and mutteredthe word mother that epithet of allothers which is dearest to the female eargod madam said the preacher hasrestored the child to your wishes it mustbe yours so to bring him up that he maynot one day wish that he had perished in hisinnocenceit shall be my charge said the lady and again throwing her arms around theboy she overwhelmed him with kisses andcaresses so much was she agitated by theterror arising from the danger in which he the abbothad been just placed and by joy at his unexpecteddeliverance eut you are not my mother said theboy collecting his recollection and endeavouringthough faintly to escape from thecaresses of the lady of avenel you arenot my mother alas i have no mother only i have dreamt that i had onei will read the dream for you my loveanswered the lady of avenel j and i willbe myself your mother surely god hasheard my wishes and in his own marvellousmanner hath sent me an object on whichmy affections may expand themselves shelooked towards warden as she spoke thepreacher hesitated what he should replyto a burst of passionate feeling which perhapsseemed to him more enthusiastic thanthe occasion demanded in the meanwhilethe large staghound wolf which droppingwet as he was had followed his mistressinto the apartment and had sate bythe bedside a patient and quiet spectatorof all the means used for resuscitation ofthe abbot the being whom he had preserved now becameimpatient of remaining any longerunnoticed and began to whine and fawnupon the lady with his great rough paws yes she said good wolf and youshall be remembered also for your day'swork and i will think the more of you forhaving preserved the life of a creature sobeautifulbut wolf was not quite satisfied with theshare of attention which he thus attracted he persisted in whining and pawing uponhis mistress his caresses being rendered stillmore troublesome by his long shaggy hairbeing so much and thoroughly wetted tillshe desired one of the domestics with whomhe was familiar to call the animal out of theapartment wolf resisted every invitationto this purpose until his mistress positivelycommanded him to begone in an angrytone whenturningtowardsthebedon whichthe boy still lay half awake to sensationhalf drowned in the meanders of a fluctuatingdelirium he uttered a deep and savage the abbotgrowl curled up his nose and lips shewinghis full range of white and sharpened teethwhich might have matched those of an actualwolf and then turning round sullenlyfollowed the domestic out of the apartmentsit is singular said the lady addressingwarden the animal is not only so goodnaturedto all but so particularly fond ofchildren what can ail him at the little fellowwhose life he has saved dogs replied the preacher are buttoo like the human race in their foiblesthough their instinct be less erring than thereason of poor mortal man when relyingupon his own unassisted powers jealousymy good lady is a passion not unknown tothem and they often evince it not onlywith respect to the preferences which theysee given by their masters to individuals oftheir own species but even when their rivalsare children you have caressed thatchild much and eagerly and the dog considershimself as a discarded favouritethe abbot it is a strange instinct j said the lady and from the gravity with which youmention it my reverend friend i wouldalmost say that you supposed this singularjealousy of my favourite wolf was not onlywellfounded but justifiable but perhapsyou speak in jest i seldom jest answered the preacher life was not lent to us to be expended inthat idle mirth which resembles the cracklingof thorns under the pot i would onlyhave you derive if it so please you thislesson from what i have said that the bestof our feelings when indulged to excessmay give pain to others there is but onein which we may indulge to the utmostlimit of vehemence of which our bosom iscapable secure that excess cannot existin the greatest intensity to which it can beexcited i mean the love of our maker surely said the lady of avenel wearecommanded by the same authority tolove our neighbour the abbot ay madam said warden but ourlove to god is to be unbounded we are tolove him with our whole heart our wholesoul and our whole strength the lovewhich the precept commands us to bear toour neighbour has affixed to it a direct limitand qualification we are to love ourneighbour as ourself as it is elsewhere explainedby the great commandment thatwe do unto him as we would that he didunto us here there is a limit and a boundeven to the most praiseworthy of our affectionsso far as they are turned uponsublunary and terrestrial objects we areto render to our neighbour whatever behis rank or degree that corresponding portionof affection with which we could rationallyexpect we should ourselves be regardedby those standing in the same degreeof relation to us hence neitherhusband nor wife neither son nor daughterneither friend nor relation are lawfully tobe made the objects of our idolatry thethe abbot lord our god is a jealous god and willnot endure that we bestow on the creaturethat extremity of devotion which he whomade us demands as his own share i sayto you lady that even in the fairest andpurest and most honourable feelings of ournature there is that original taint of sinwhich ought to make us pause and hesitateere we indulge them to excess i understand not this reverend sirsaid the lady nor do i guess what i canhave now said or done to draw down onme an admonition which has something ataste of reprooflady said warden i crave yourpardon if i have urged aught beyond thelimits of my duty but consider whetherin the sacred promise to be not only a protectressbut a mother to this poor childyour purpose may meet the wishes of thenoble knight your husband the fondnesswhich you have lavished on

not tell the imp he had no mothercoimt basilwhen warden had left the apartment thelady of avenel gave way to the feelings oftenderness which the sight of the boy hissudden danger and his recent escape hadinspired and no longer awed by the sternnessas she deemed it of the preacher heapedwith caresses the lovely and interestingchild he was now in some measure recoveredfrom the consequences of his accidentand received passively though notwithout wonder the tokens of kindnesswith which he was thus loaded the facethe abbot of the lady was strange to him and herdress different and far more sumptuous thanany he remembered but the boy was naturallyof an undaunted temper and indeedchildren are generally acute physiognomistsand not only pleased by that which isbeautiful in itself but peculiarly acute indistinguishing and replying to the attentionsof those who really love them ifthey see a person in company though aperfect stranger who is by nature fond ofchildren the little imps seem to discover itby a sort of freemasonry while the awkwardattempts of those who make advancesto them for the purpose of recommendingthemselves to the parents usually fail inattracting their reciprocal attention thelittle boy therefore appeared in some degreesensible of the lady's caresses and itwas with difficulty she withdrew herselffrom his pillow to afford him leisure fornecessary

lady of she did not chuse to hear and thus itwas on the present occasion she resolvedto look more close and sharply after the boywho had hitherto been committed chieflyto the management of lilias he must shethought be born of gentle blood it wereshame to think otherwise of a form so nobleand features so fair the very wildnessin which he occasionally indulged his contemptof danger and impatience of restrainthad in them something noble assuredlythe child was born of high rank suchwas her conclusion and she acted upon itaccordingly the domestics around herless jealous or less scrupulous than liliasacted as servants usually do following thebias and flattering for their own purposesthe humour of the lady and the boy soontook on him those airs of superiority whichthe sight of habitual deference seldom failsvol i c the abbotto inspire it seemed in truth as if tocommand were his natural sphere so easilydid he use himself to exact and receivecompliance with his humours the chaplainindeed might have interposed tocheck the air of superiority which rolandgreene so readily indulged and most probablywould have willingly rendered himthat favour but the necessity of adjustingwith his brethren some disputed points ofchurch discipline had withdrawn him forsome time from the castle and detainedhim in a distant part of the kingdommatters stood thus in the castle of when a winded bugle sent its shrilland prolonged notes from the shore of thelake and was replied to cheerily by thesignal of the warder the lady of knew the sounds of her husband andrushed to the window of the apartment inwhich she was sitting a band of aboutthirty spearmen with a pennon displayedbefore them winded along the indentedshores of the lake and approached thethe abbot causeway a single horseman rode at thehead of the party his bright arms catchinga glance of the october sun as he movedsteadily along even at that distance thelady recognized the lofty plume bearingthe mingled colours of her own liveriesblended with the hollybranch and thefirm seat and dignified demeanour of therider joined to the stately motion of thedarkbrown steed sufficiently announcedhalbert glendinningthe lady's first thought was that of rapturousjoy at her husband's return her secondwas connected with a fear which hadsometimes intruded itself that he mightnot altogether approve the peculiar distinctionwith which she had treated her orphanward in this fear there was implieda consciousness that the favour she hadshewn him was excessive for halbert glendiningwas at least as gentle and indulgentas he was firm and rational in the intercourseof his household and to her in the abbotparticular his conduct had ever been mostaffectionately tenderyet she did fear that on the present occasionher conduct might incur sir albert'scensure and hastily resolving thatshe would not mention the anecdote of theboy until the next day she ordered him tobe withdrawn from the apartment by lilies i will not go with lilias madam answeredthe spoiled child who had morethan once carried his point by perseveranceand who like his betters delighted in theexercise of such authority i will notgo to lilias's gouty room i will stay andsee that brave warrior who comes riding sogallantly along the drawbridge you must not stay roland said thelady more positively than she usually spoketo her little favourite i will reiterated the boy who hadalready felt his consequence and the probablechance of successthe abbot you will roland answered the ladywhat manner of word is that i tell youyou must gowil answered the forward boy isa word for a man and must is no word foraladyyou are saucy sirrah said the lady lilias take him with you instantlyi always thought said lilias smilingas she seized the reluctant boy by the armthat my young master must give place tomy old oneand you too are malapert mistresssaid the lady j hath the moon changedthat ye all of you thus forget yourselves lilias made no reply but led off the boywho too proud to offer unavailing resistancedarted at his benefactress a glancewhich intimated plainly how willingly hewould have defied her authority had he possessedthe power to make good his pointthe lady of avenel was vexed to findhow much this trifling circumstance haddiscomposed her at the moment when she the abbotought naturally to have been entirely engrossedby her husband's return but wedo not recover composure by the merefeeling that agitation is mistimed theglow of displeasure had not left the lady'scheek her ruffled deportment was not yetentirely composed when her husband unhelmetbut still wearing the rest of hisarms entered the apartment his appearancebanished the thoughts of every thingelse she rushed to him clasped his ironsheathedframe in her arms and kissed hismartial and manly face with an affectionwhich was at once evident and sincerethe warrior returned her embrace and hercaress with the same fondness for the timewhich had passed since their union had diminishedits romantic ardour perhaps buthad rather increased its rational tendernessand sir halbert glendinning's long and frequentabsences from his castle had preventedaffection from degenerating into indifferencewhen the first eager greetings were paidthe abbot and received the lady gazed fondly on herhusband's face as she remarked you are altered halbert you have riddenhard and far today or you have beenill i have been well mary answered theknight passing well have i been and along ride is to me thou well knowest but athing of constant custom those who areborn noble may slumber out their lives withinthe walls of their castles and manorhouses but he who hath achieved nobility by hisown deeds must ever be in the saddle toshew that he merits his advancementwhile he spoke thus the lady gazed fondlyon him as if endeavouring to read hisinmost soul for the tone in which he spokewas that of melancholy depressionsir halbert glendinning was the sameyet a different person from what he had appearedin his early years the fiery freedomof the aspiring youth had given placeto the steady and stern composure of theapproved soldier and skilful politician ihe abbotthere were deep traces of care on thosenoble features over which each emotionused formerly lo pass like light cloudsacross a summer sky that sky was nownot perhaps clouded but still and gravelike that of the sober autumn evening theforehead was higher and more bare than inearly youth and the locks which still clusteredthick and dark on the warrior's headwere worn away at the temples not by agebut by the constant pressure of the steelcap or helmet his beard according tothe fashion of the times grew short andthick and was turned into mustachios onthe upper lip and peaked at the extremitythe cheek weatherbeaten and embroiledhad lost the glow of youth but shewedthe vigorous complexion of active and confirmedmanhood halbert glendinning wasin a word a knight to ride at a king'sright hand to bear his banner in war andto be his counsellor in time of peace forhis looks expressed the considerate firmnesswhich can resolve wisely and dare boldlythe abbot still over these noble features there nowspread an air of dejection of which perhapsthe owner was not conscious butwhich did not escape the observation of hisanxious and affectionate partner something has happened or is aboutto happen said the lady of avenel thissadness sits not on your brow without causemisfortune national or particular mustneeds be at hand there is nothing new that i wot ofsaid

favour in which he was held bythe powerful earl of murray and the hightalents by which he vindicated his right tothat rank and that favour were qualitieswhich rather encreased than diminished theenvy which was harboured against sir haltheabbot bert glendinning as a person originally ofinferior and obscure birth who had risen tohis present eminence solely by his personalmerit the natural firmness of his minddid not enable him to despise the ideal advantagesof a high pedigree which wereheld in such universal esteem by all withwhom he conversed and so open are thenoblest minds to jealous inconsistenciesthat there were moments in which he feltmortified that his lady should possess thoseadvantages of birth and high descent whichhe himself did not enjoy and regretted thathis importance as the proprietor of avenelwas qualified by his possessing it only asthe husband of the heiress he was not sounjust as to permit any unworthy feelingsto retain permanent possession of his mindbut yet they recurred from time to timeand did not escape his lady's anxious observation had we been blessed with childrenshe was wont on such occasions to say toherself had our blood been united in af the

in idiom our affections as well as ourpretensions might have centered has beendenied to uswith such mutual feelings it cannot bewondered at that the lady heard her husbandwith pain verging towards this topicof mutual discontent on the present ason other similar occasions she endeavouredto divert her husband's thoughts fromthis painful channel how can you she said suffer yourselfto dwell upon thoughts which profit nothing have you indeed no name to uphold you the good and the brave thewise in council and the strong in battlehave you not to support the reputation yourown deeds have won a reputation more honourablethan mere ancestry can supply good men love and honour you the wicktheabbot ed fear and the turbulent obey you and isit not necessary you should exert yourselfto ensure the endurance of that love thathonour that wholesome fear and that necessaryobedience as she thus spoke the eye of her husbandcaught from her's courage and comfortand it lightened as he took her handand replied the abbot grasme the prejudices wolf were easilyovercome and in process of time the dogslept with bran loath and the celebratedhounds of ancient days but mr wardenthe chaplain lived and

inhabitants of the castlemore deference than the haughty youngpage proud of his mistress's favour andpetulant from youth and situation was atall times willing to pay his bold and freedemeanour his attachment to rich dressand decoration his inaptitude to receiveinstruction and his hardening himselfagainst rebuke were circumstances whichinduced the good old man with morehaste than charity to set the forward pagedown as a vessel of wrath and to presagethat the youth nursed that pride andhaughtiness of spirit which goes beforeruin and destruction most of the attendsthe abbotants and followers of sir halbert glendiningentertained the same charitablethought but while roland was favouredby their lady and endured by their lordthey saw no policy in making their opinionspublickoland grasme was

madam said the pertinaciouspreacher your benevolent purposein taking charge of this youth or yourtitle to give him this idle character of pagethe abbor if such was your pleasure though what theeducation of a boy in the train of a femalecan tend to save to engraft foppery andeffeminacy on conceit and arrogance itpasses my knowledge to discover but iblame you more directly for having takenlittle care to guard him against the perils ofhis condition or to tame and humble a spiritnaturally haughty overbearing and impatientyou have brought into your bowera lion's cub delighted with the beauty ofhis fur and the grace of his gambols youhave bound him with no fetters befittingthe fierceness of his disposition you havelet him grow up as unawed as if he hadbeen still a tenant of the forest and nowyou are surprised and call out for assistancewhen he begins to ramp rend andtear according to his proper nature mr warden said the lady considerablyoffended you are my husband's ancientfriend and i believe your love sincereto him and to his household yet let mesay that when i asked you for counsel i the abbotexpected not this asperity of rebuke if ihave done wrong in loving this poor orphanlad more than others of his class i scarcethink the error merited such severe censure and if stricter discipline were requiredto keep his fiery temper in order itought i think to be considered that i amawoman and that if i have erred in thismatter it becomes a friend's part rather toaid than to rebuke me i would these evilswere taken order with before my lord's returnhe loves not domestic discord ordomestic brawls and i would not willinglythat he thought such could arise fromone whom i have favoured what do youcounsel me to do dismiss this youth from your servicemadam replied the preacheryou cannot bid me do so said thelady you cannot as a christian and aman of humanity bid me turn away an unprotectedcreature against whom my favourmy injudicious favour if you will hasreared up so many enemiesithe abbot it is not necessary you should altogetherabandon him though you dismiss himto another service or to a calling bettersuiting his station and character said thepreacher elsewhere he may be an usefuland profitable member of the commonweal here he is but a makebate and astumblingblock of offence the youthhas snatches of sense and of intelligencethough he

conference fromwhich mr warden derived the greatest pleasurethe pulpit was at that time the samepowerful engine for affecting popular feeling which the press has since become andhe had been no unsuccessful preacher aswe have already seen it followed as a naturalconsequence that he rather overestimatedthe powers of his own oratory andlike some of his brethren about the periodwas glad of an opportunity to handle anymatters of importance whether public orthr abbor private the discussion of which could bedragged into his discourse in that rude agethe delicacy was unknown which

and offended the menials could hardly containunder an affectation of deep attention thejoy with which they heard the chaplainlaunch his thunders at the head of the unpopularfavourite mrs lilias crested anddrew up her head with all the deepfeltpride of gratified resentment while thesteward observing a strict neutrality of aspectfixed his eyes upon an old scutcheonon the opposite side of the wall which heseemed to examine with the most minuteaccuracy more willing perhaps to incurthe censure of being inattentive to the sermonthan that of seeming to listen withmarked approbation to what appeared sodistasteful to his mistressthe abbot the unfortunate subject of the haranguewhom nature had endowed with passionswhich had hitherto found no effectual restraintcould not disguise the resentmentwhich he felt at being thus directly heldup to the scorn as well as the censure ofthe assembled inhabitants of the little worldin which he lived his brow grew red hislip grew pale he set his teeth he clenchedhis hand and then with mechanical readinessgrasped the weapon of which the clergymanhad given so hideous a character and at length as the preacher heightenedthe colouring of his invective he felt hisrage become so ungovernable that fearfulof being hurried into some deed of desperateviolence he rose up traversed thechapel with hasty steps and left the congregationthe preacher was surprised into a suddenpause while the fiery youth shot acrosshim like a flash of lightning eyeing him ashepassed as if he had wished to dartfrom his eyes the same power of blighting the abbotand of consuming but no sooner had hecrossed the chapel and shut with violencebehind him the door of the vaulted entranceby which it communicated with thecastle than the impropriety of his conductsupplied warden with one of thosehappier subjects for eloquence of whichhe knew how to take advantage for makinga suitable impression on his hearershe paused for an instant and then pronouncedin a slow and solemn voice the deepanathema he hath gone out from us becausehe was not of us the sick man hathbeen offended at the wholesome bitter of themedicine the wounded patient hath flinchedfrom the friendly

difficulties selfsearchingcan do much meditation cando much grace can do alland he concluded with a touching andanimating exhortation to his hearers toseek divine grace which is perfected inhumanweaknessthe audience did not listen to this addresswithout being considerably affected though it might be doubted whether thefeelings of triumph received from the disgracefulretreat of the favourite page didnot greatly qualify in the minds of manythe exhortations of the preacher to charityand to humility and in fact the expressionof their countenances much resembledthe satisfied triumphant air of aset of children who having just seen acompanion punished for a fault in whichthey had no share con their task withdouble glee both because they themselves the abbotare out of the scrape and because the culpritis in itwith very different feelings did the ladyof avenel seek her own apartment shefelt angry at warden having made a domesticmatter in which she took a personalinterest the subject of such public discussionbut this she knew the good manclaimed as a branch of his christian libertyas a preacher and also that it was vindicatedby the universal custom of his brethrenbut the selfwilled conduct of herprotege afforded her yet deeper concernthat he had broken through in so remarkablea degree not only the respect due toher presence but that which was paid inthose days with such peculiar reverenceargued a spirit as untameable as his enemieshad represented him to possess andyet so far as he had been under her owneye she had seen no more of that fieryspirit than appeared to her to become hisyears and his vivacity this opinion mightbe founded in some degree on partiality jthe abbot in some degree too it might be owing tothe kindness and indulgence which shehad always extended to him but still shethought it impossible that she could be totallymistaken in the estimate she hadformed of his character the extreme ofviolence is scarce consistent with a courseof continued hypocrisy although liliascharitably hinted that in some instancesthey were happily united and thereforeshe could not exactly trust the report ofothers against her own experience and observationthe thoughts of this orphanboy clung to her heartstrings with a fondnessfor which she herself was unable toaccount he seemed to have been sent toher by heaven to fill up those intervals oflanguor and vacuity which deprived her ofso much enjoyment perhaps he was notless dear to her because she well saw thathe was a favourite with no one else andbecause she felt that to give him up wasto afford the judgment of her husband andothers a triumph over her own j a circuitthe abbotstance not quite indifferent to the best ofspouses of either sexin short the lady of avenel formed theinternal resolution that she would not deserther page while her page could be rationallyprotected and with the view ofascertaining how far this might be doneshe caused him to be summoned to

comes hither with his downcast eyes thathe never raises to my lady's face and withhis low sweettoned voice and his benedictinesand his bennisons and who so readyto take them kindly as mr wingate mrs lilias replied the butler with anair which was intended to close the debatethere are reasons for all things if i receivedfather ambrose debonair and sufferedhim to steal a word now and then withthis same roland gramme it was not that icared a brass boodle for his benson or malisoneither but only because i respected mymaster's blood and who can answer ifmary come in again whether he may not beas stout a tree to lean to as ever his brotherhath proved to us for down goes the earlof murray when the queen comes by herown again and good is his luck if he cankeep the head on his own shoulders

as wheni told of roland grseme shooting the wildswanmaster wingate was somewhat dismayedat perceiving that the detail which he hadgiven of his farsighted political views hadproduced on his hearer rather suspicion ofhis fidelity than admiration of his wisdomand endeavoured as hastily as possible toapologize and to explain although internallyextremely offended at the unreasonableview as he deemed it which it hadpleased mistress lilias bradbury to takeof his expressions and mentally convincedthat her disapprobation of his sentimentsarose solely out of the considerationthat though father ambrose supposinghim to become the master of the castlewould certainly require the services of asteward yet those of a waitingwomanwould in the supposed circumstances bealtogether superfluousafter his explanation had been receivedas explanations usually are the two friendsthe abbot separated lilias to attend the silver whistlewhich called her to her mistress's chamberand the sapient majordomo to theduties of his own department they partedwith less than their usual degree of reverenceand regard for the steward felt thathis worldly wisdom was rebuked by themore disinterested attachment of the

and bloodmaster rolandin the midst of his rage roland graemethe abbot was just wise enough to see that by continuingthis altercation he would subjecthimself to very rude treatment from theboor who was so much older and strongerthan himself and while his antagonist witha sort of jeering laugh of defiance seemedto provoke the contest he felt the full bitternessof his own degraded condition andburst into a passion of tears which he invain endeavoured to conceal with both hishandseven the rough churl was moved withthe distress of his quondam companion nay master roland he said i didbut as twere

off whistling as he went and gladapparently to be rid of an acquaintancewhose claims might be troublesome andwho had no longer the means to be serviceableto himroland graeme compelled himself to walkon while they were within sight of eachother that his former inmate might not augurany vacillation of purpose or uncertaintyof object from his remaining on thesame spot j but the effort was a painful one the abbothe seemed stunned as it were and giddy the earth on which he stood felt as if unsoundand quaking under his feet likethe surface of a bog and he had once ortwice nearly fallen though the path he trodwas of firm greensward he kept resolutelymoving forward in spite of the internalagitation to which these symptoms belongeduntil the distant form of his acquaintancedisappeared behind the slope ofa hill when his heart gave way at once and sitting down on the turf remote fromhuman ken he gave way to the natural expressionsof wounded pride grief and fearand wept with unrestrained profusion andunqualified bitternesswhen the first violent paroxysm of hisfeelings had subsided the deserted andfriendless youth felt that mental relief whichusually follows such discharges of sorrowthe tears continued to chase each otherdown his cheeks but they were no longeraccompanied by the same sense of desolationj an afflicting yet milder sentiment wasthe abbot awakened in his mind by the recollectionof his benefactress of the unwearied kindnesswhich had attached her to him in spiteof many acts of provoking petulance nowrecollected as offences of a deep dye whichhad protected him against the machinationsof others as well as against the consequencesof his own folly and would havecontinued to do so had not the excess ofhis presumption compelled her to withdrawher protectionwhatever indignity i have borne hesaid has been the just reward of my owningratitude and have i done well to acceptthe hospitality the more than maternalkindness of my protectress yet to detainfrom her the knowledge of my religion but she shall know that a catholic has asmuch gratitude as a puritan that i havebeen thoughtless but not wicked that inmy wildest moments i have loved respectedand honoured her and that the orphanboy might indeed be heedless but was neverungrateful the abbothe turned as these thoughts passedthrough his mind and began hastily to retreadhis footsteps towards the castle buthe checked the first eagerness of his repentanthaste when he reflected on thescorn and contempt with which the familywere likely to see the return of the fugitivehumbled as they must necessarily supposehim into a supplicant who requestedpardon for his fault and permission to returnto his service he slackened his pacebut he stood not stilli care not he resolutely determined let them wink point nod sneer speakof the conceit which is humbled of thepride which has had a fall i care not itis a penance due to my folly and i willendure it with patience but if she alsomy benefactress if she also should thinkme sordid and weakspirited enough to begnot for her pardon alone but for a renewalof the advantages which i derived from herfavour r suspicion of my meanness icannot i will not brookthe abbot he stood still and his pride rallying withconstitutional obstinacy against his morejust feeling urged that he would incur thescorn of the lady of avenel rather thanobtain her favour by following the coursewhich the first ardour of his repentant feelingshad dictated to himif i had but some plausible pretexthe thought some ostensible reason formy return some reason to allege whichmight shew i came not as a degraded supplicantor a discarded menial i might gothither but as i am i cannot my heartwould leap from its place and burstas these thoughts passed through hismind something passed in the air so nearhim as to dazzle his eyes and almost tobrush the plume in his cap he looked upit was the favourite falcon of sir halbertwhich flying around his head seemed toclaim his attention as that of a wellknownfriend roland extended his arm and gavethe wellknown whoop and the falcon the abbotscanty settled on his wrist and began toprune itself glancing at the youth fromtime to time an acute and brilliant glanceof its hazel eye which seemed to ask whyhe caressed it not with his usual fondnessah diamond he said as if the birdunderstood him thou and i must be strangershenceforward many a gallant stoophave i seen thee make and many a braveheron strike down but that is all over andthere is no hawking more for me and why not master roland saidadam woodcock the falconer who cameat that instant from behind a few alderbushes which had concealed him from viewwhy should there be no more hawkingfor you why man what were our lifewithout our sports thou know'st the jollyold songand rather would allan in dungeon liethan live at large where the falcon cannot fly and allan would rather lie in sexton's poundthan live where he follow'd not the merry hawk andhoundthe abbot the voice of the honest falconer washearty and friendly and the tone in whichhe half sung half recited his rude balladimplied honest frankness and cordialitybut remembrance of their quarrel and itsconsequences embarrassed roland and preventedhis reply the falconer saw his hesitationand guessed the causewhat now said he master roland do you who are half an englishman thinkthat i who am a whole one would keep upanger at you and you in distress thatwere like some of the scots my master'sreverence always excepted who can befair and false and wait their time and keeptheir mind as they say to themselves andtouch pot and flagon with you and huntand hawk with you and after all when timeserves pay off some old feud with the pointof the dagger canny yorkshire has nomemory for such old sores why man anyou had hit me a rough blow maybe iwould rather have taken it from you thanarough word from another j for you have a the abbotgood notion of falconry though you standup for washing the meat for the classesso give us your hand man and bear nomaliceroland though he felt his proud bloodrebel at the familiarity of honest adam'saddress could not resist its downright franknesscovering his face with the one handhe held out the other to the falconer andreturned with readiness his friendly graspwhy this is hearty now said woodcock i always said you had a kind heartthough you have a spice of the devil inyour disposition that is certain i camethis way with the falcon on purpose to findyou and yon halfbred hubbard told mewhich way you took flight you everthought too much of that kestrelkite masterroland and he knows nought of sportafter all but what he caught from you isaw how it had been betwixt you and isent him out of my company with a wantoni would rather have a rifler on my perchthan a false knave at my elbow and nowthe abbot master roland tell me what way wingye that is as god pleases replied thepage with a sigh which he could not suppress nay man never droop a feather forbeing cast off said the falconer whoknows but you may soar the better andfairer flight for all this yet look at diamondthere tis a noble bird and shewsgallantly with his hood and bells and jesses but there is many a wild falcon in norwaythat would not change properties with him and that is what i would say of youyou are no longer my lady's page and youwill not clothe so fair or feed so well orsleep so soft or shew so gallant what ofall that if you are not her page you areyour own man and may go where you willwithout minding whoop or whistle theworst is the loss of the sport but who knowswhat you may come to they say that sirhalbert himself i speak with reverencewas once glad to be the abbot's forester the abbotand now he has hounds and hawks of hisown and adam woodcock for a falconerto the boot you are right and say well adamanswered the youth the blood mantling inhis cheeks the falcon will soar higherwithout his bells than with them thoughthe bells be made of silverthat is cheerily spoken answered thefalconer and whither now i thought of going to the abbey ofkennaquhair answered roland grme to ask the counsel of father ambrose and joy go with you said the falconer though it is like you may find theold monks in some sorrow they say thecommons are threatening to turn them outof their cells and make a devil's mass of itin the old church thinking they have forbornethat sport too long and troth i amclear of the same opinion then will father ambrose be the betterof having a friend beside him said thepage manfullyay but my young fearnought retheabbot plied the falconer the friend will scarcebe the better of being beside father ambrose he may come by the redder's lickand that is ever the worst of the battlei care not for that said the page thedread of a lick should not hold me back but i fear i may bring trouble between thebrothers by visiting father ambrose iwill tarry tonight at saint cuthbert's cellwhere the old priest will give me a night'sshelter and i will send to father ambroseto ask his advice before i go down to theconvent by our lady said the falconer andthat is a likely plan and now he continuedexchanging his frankness of mannerfor a sort of awkward embarrassment as ifhe had somewhat to say that he had noready means to bring out and now youwot well that i wear a pouch for my hawks meat and so forth but wot you what it islined with master roland with leather to be sure replied rolandsomewhat surprised at the hesitation the abbotwith which adam woodcock asked a questionso simplewith leather lad said woodcock ay and with silver to the boot of thatsee here he said shewing a secret slit inthe lining of his bag of office here theyare thirty good harry groats as ever werestruck in bluff old hall's time and ten ofthem are right heartily at your service andnow the murder is outroland's first idea was to refuse this assistance but he recollected the vows of humilitywhich he had just taken upon himand it occurred that this was the opportunityto put his newformed resolution tothe test assuming a strong command ofhimself he answered adam woodcock withas much frankness as his nature permittedhim to wear in doing what was so contraryto his inclinations that he acceptedthankfully of his kind offer while to soothhis own reviving pride he could not helpadding he hoped soon to requite theobligationthe abbot ll that as you list that as you listyoung man said the falconer with gleecounting out and delivering to his youngfriend the supply he had so generously offeredand then adding with great chearfulness now you may go through theworld for he that can back a horse wind ahorn hollow a greyhound fly a hawk andplay at sword and buckler with a wholepair of shoes a green jacket and ten lilywhitegroats in his pouch may bid fathercare hang himself in his own jesses farewelland god be with youso saying and as if desirous to avoid thethanks of

avoid asmuch as possible drawing upon himselfobservation or animadversion the appearanceof his habitation however when rolandgraeme came before it in the close ofthe evening plainly shewed that his cautionhad been finally ineffectualthe page's first movement was to knockat the door when he observed to his surprisethat it was open not from being leftunlatched but because beat off its upperhinge it was only fastened to the doorpostby the lower and could therefore no longerperform its functions somewhat alarmedat this and receiving no answer whenhe knocked and called roland began tolook more

eldertimes had secured and protected its healingwaters these arches were now almostentirely demolished and the stonesof which they were built were tumbled intothe well as if with the purpose of

covered the effects of violencewith creeping plants and with weatherstains exhibit amid their decay a melancholybeauty but when the visible effectsof violence appear raw and recentthere is no feeling to mitigate the sense ofdevastation with which they impress thespectators and such was now the sceneon which the youthful page gazed with thepainful feelings it was qualified to excitewhen his first momentary surprise wasover roland grseme was at no loss to conjecturethe cause of these ravages thedestruction of the popish edifices did nottake place at once throughout scotland butat different times and according to the spiritwhich actuated the reformed clergy some of whom instigated their hearers tos the abbotthese acts of demolition and others withbetter taste and feeling endeavoured to protectthe ancient shrines while they desiredto see them purified from the objects whichhad attracted idolatrous devotion fromtime to time therefore the populace of thescottish towns and villages when instigatedeither by their own feelings of abhorrencefor popish superstition or by the zealousdoctrines of the more zealous preachersresumed the work of destruction and exercisedit upon some sequestered churchchapel or cell which had escaped thefirst burst of their indignation against thereligion of rome in many places the vicesof the catholic clergy arising out of thewealth and the corruption of that tremendoushierarchy furnished too good an apologyfor wreaking vengeance upon thesplendid edifices which they inhabited andof this an old scottish historian gives a

compose himselfto restthe abbot chapter ixkneel with me swear it tis not in words i trustsave when they're fenced with an appeal to heavenold flayafter passing the night in that soundsleep for which agitation and fatigue hadprepared him roland was awakened bythe fresh morning air and by the beamsof the rising sun his first feeling wasthat of surprise for instead of lookingforth from a turret window on the watersof the lake of avenel which was the prospecthis former apartment afforded anlatticed aperture gave him the view ofthe demolished garden of the banishedanchorite he sate up on his couch ofleaves and arranged in his memory not the abbotwithout surprise the singular events of thepreceding day which appeared the more surprisingthe more he considered them hehad lost the protectress of his youth andin the same day he had recovered theguide and guardian of his childhood theformer deprivation he felt ought to be matterof unceasing regret and it seemed as ifthe latter could hardly be the subject ofunmixed self congratulation he rememberedthis person who had stood to him inthe relation of a mother as equally affectionatein her attention and absolute inher authority a singular mixture of loveand fear attended upon his early remembrancesas they were connected with her and the fear that she might desire to resumethe same absolute controul over hismotions a fear which her conduct of yesterdaydid not tend much to dissipateweighed heavily against the joy of this secondmeeting she cannot mean said his rising prideto lead and direct me as a pupil when ithe abbot am at the age of judging of my own actions this she cannot mean or meaningit will feel herself strangely deceiveda sense of gratitude towards the personagainst whom his heart thus rebelled checkedhis course of feeling he resisted thethoughts which involuntarily arose in hismind as he would have resisted an actualinstigation of the foul fiend and to aidhim in his struggles he felt for his beadsbut in his hasty departure from the castleof avenel he had forgotten and left thembehind him this is yet worse he said but twothings i learned of her under the mostdeadly charge of secrecy to tell my beadsand to conceal that i did so and i havekept my word till now and when she shallask me for the rosary i must say i haveforgotten it do i deserve she should believeme when i say i have kept the secretof my faith when i set so light by its symbol the abbothe paced the floor in anxious agitationin fact his attachment to his faith was ofa nature very different from that which animatedthe enthusiastic matron but whichnotwithstanding it would have been his lastthought to relinquishthe early charges impressed on him byhis grandmother had been instilled into amind and memory of a character peculiarlytenacious child as he was he was proudof the confidence reposed in his discretionand resolved to shew that it had not beenrashly entrusted to him at the same timehis resolution was no more than that of achild and must necessarily have graduallyfaded away under the operation bothof precept and example during his residenceat the castle of avenel but for theexhortations of father ambrose who inhis lay state had been called edward glendiningthis zealous monk had been apprizedby an unsigned letter placed in hishand by a pilgrim that a child educated inthe abbot the catholic faith was now in the castle ofavenel perilously situated so was thescroll expressed as ever the three childrenwho were cast into the fiery furnace of persecutionthe letter threw upon fatherambrose the fault should this solitarylamb unwillingly left within the demesnesof the prowling wolf become his final preythere needed no farther exhortation tothe monk than the idea that a soul mightbe endangered and that a catholic mightbecome an apostate and he made his visitsmore frequent than usual to the castleof avenel lest through want of the privateencouragement and instruction whichhe always found some opportunity of dispensingthe church should lose a proselyteand according to the romish creedthe devil acquire a soulstill these interviews were rare andthough they encouraged the solitary boyto keep his secret and hold fast his religionthey were neither frequent nor long enoughto inspire him with any thing beyond a the abbotblind attachment to the observances whichthe priest recommended he adhered tothe forms of his religion rather because hefelt it would be dishonourable to changethat of his fathers than from any rationalor sincere belief of its mysterious doctrinesit was a principal

detailed were at thattime to be found in every border hamleta brook flowed beside the village and wateredthe valley in which it stood therewas also a mansion at the end of the villagethe abbot and a little way separated from it muchdilapidated and in very bad order but appearingto have been the abode of personsof some consideration the situation wasagreeable being an angle formed by thestream bearing three or four large sycamoretrees which being in full leaf servedto relieve the dark appearance of the mansionwhich was built of a deep red stonethe house itself had been a large one butwas now obviously too big for the inmates several windows were built up especiallythose which opened from the lower storey others were blockaded in a less substantialmanner the court before the door whichhad once been defended with a species oflow outer wall now ruinous was pavedbut the stones were completely coveredwith long grey nettles thistles and otherweeds which shooting up betwixt the flagshad displaced many of them from theirlevel even matters demanding more peremptoryattention had been left neglected the abbotin a manner vhich argued sloth or povertyin the extreme the stream undermininga part of the bank near an angle of the ruinouswall had brought it down with a cornerturret the ruins of which lay in the bedof the river the current interrupted bythe ruins which it had overthrown andturned yet nearer to the site of the towerhad greatly enlarged the breach it hadmade and was in the process of underminingthe ground on which the house itselfstood unless it were speedily protected bysufficient bulwarksall this attracted roland graeme's observationas they approached the dwelling bya winding path which gave them at intervalsa view of it from different pointsif we go to yonder house he said tohis mother i trust it is but for a short visitit looks as if two rainy days from thenorthwest would send the whole into thebrookyou see but with the eyes of the bodythe abbot said the old woman god will defendhis own though it be forsaken and despisedof men better to dwell on the sandunder his law than fly to the rock of humantrustas she thus spoke they entered thecourt before the old mansion and rolandcould observe that the front of it had formerlybeen considerably ornamented withcarved work in the same darkcolouredfreestone of which it was built but allthese ornaments had been broken downand destroyed and only the shattered vestigesof niches and entablatures now strewedthe place which they had once occupiedthe larger entrance in front was walled upbut a little footpath which from its appearanceseemed to be rarely trodden ledto a small wicket defended by a door wellclenched with ironheaded nails at whichmagdalen grme knocked three timespausing betwixt each knock until she heardan answering tap from within at the lastknock the wicket was opened by a pale the abborthin female who said benedicite qui ver inient in nomine domini they enteredand the portress hastily shut behind themthe wicket and made fast the massive fasteningsby which it was securedthe female led the way through a narrowentrance into a vestibule of some extentpaved with stone and having benchesof the same solid material ranged aroundat the upper end was an oriel window butpart of the intervals formed by the stoneshafts and mullions was blocked up so thatthe apartment was very gloomyhere they stopped and the mistress ofthe mansion for such she was embracedmagdalen graeme and greeting her by thetitle of sister kissed her with much solemnityon either side of the facethe blessing of our lady be upon youmy sister were her next words and theyleft no doubt upon roland's mind respectingthe religion of their hostess even ifhe could have suspected his venerable andzealous guide of resting elsewhere than inthe abbot fthe habitation of an orthodox catholicthey spoke together a few words in privateduring which he had leisure to remarkmore particularly the appearance ofhis grandmother's friendher age might be betwixt fifty and sixty her looks had a mixture of melancholy andunhappiness that bordered on discontentand obscured the remains of beauty whichage had still left on her features herdress was of the plainest and most ordinarysort of a dark colour and like magdalengreene's something approaching to a religioushabit strict neatness and cleanlinessof person seemed to intimate that if poorshe was not reduced to squalid or heartbrokendistress and that she was still sufficientlyattached to life to retain a taste for itsdecencies if not its elegancies her manneras well as her features and appearance arguedan original condition and educationfar above the meanness of her present appearancela short the whole figure wassuch as to excite the idea that female the abbotmust have had a history worth knowingwhile roland grasme was making this veryreflection the whispers of the two femalesceased and the mistress of the mansionapproaching him looked on his face andperson with much attention and as it seemedsome interest this then she said addressing hisrelative is the child of thine unhappydaughter magdalen and him the onlyshoot from

beencalled to make such sacrifice to plunge ayouth so young and fair into the plots andthe abbot bloodthirsty dealings of the time not thepatriarch abraham when he led isaac upthe mountain would have rendered moremelancholy obedienceshe then continued to look at rolandwith a mournful aspect of compassionuntil the intentness of her gaze occasionedhis colour to rise and he was about to moveout of its influence when he was stoppedby his grandmother with one hand whilewith the other she divided the hair uponhis forehead which was now crimson withbashfulness while she added with a mixtureof proud affection and firm resolution ay look at him well my sister for ona fairer face thine eye never rested i toowhen first i saw him felt as the worldlyfeel and was half shaken in my purposebut no wind

lawful and necessary fear nothingfrom him i would he were as wellgrounded in the faith by which alone comessafety as he is free from thought deed orspeech of villainy therein is the

friend a whiteningof the sepulchre but he shall see catherinesince you sister judge it safe andmeet follow us youth she added andled the way from the apartment with herfriend these were the only words whichthe matron had addressed to roland graemewho obeyed them in silence as they pacedthe abbot through several winding passaigesafifi wafeapartments with a very slow step the youngpage had leisure to make some reflections onhis situation reflections of a nature whichhis ardent temper considered as speciallydisagreeable it seemed he had now gottwo mistresses or buttresses instead of oneboth elderly women and both it wouldseem in league to direct his motions accordingto their own pleasure and for theaccomplishment of plans to which he wasno party this he thought was too much arguing reasonably enough that whateverright his grandmother and benefactress hadto guide his motions she was neither entitledto transfer her authority or to divideit with another who seemed to assumewithout ceremony the same tone of absolutecommand over himbut it shall not long continue thusthought roland i will not be all my lifethe slave of a woman's whistle to liveupon her exhibition go when she bids andvol i

them executetheir own devices by their own properforce it may save them both from a perilfor i guess what they meditate is not liketo prove either safe or easy the earl ofmurray and his heresy are too well rootedto be grubbed up by two old womenas he spoke thus they entered a lowroom in which a third female was seatedthis apartment was the first he had observedin the mansion which was furnishedwith moveable seats and with a woodentable over which was laid a piece of tapestrya carpet was spread on the floorthere was a firegrate in the chimney andin brief the apartment had the air of beinghabitable and inhabitedbut roland's eyes found better employmentthan to make observations on the actheabbot commendations of the chamber for thissecond female inhabitant of the mansionseemed something very different from anythinghe had yet seen there at his firstentry she had greeted with a silent andlow obeisance the two aged matrons thenglancing her eyes towards roland she adjusteda veil which hung back over hershoulders so as to bring it over her face an operation which she performed withmuch modesty but without either affectedhaste or embarrassed timidityduring this manoeuvre roland had timeto observe that the face was that of a girlnot much past sixteen apparently and thatthe eyes were at once soft and brilliantto these very favourable observations wasadded the certainty that the fair object towhom they referred possessed an excellentshape bordering perhaps on evibonpointyand therefore rather that of a hebe than ofa sylph but beautifully formed and shewnto great advantage by the close jacket and the abbotpetticoat which she wore after a foreignfashion the last not quite long enough absolutelyto conceal a very pretty foot whichrested on a bar of the table at which shesate her round arms and taper fingers verybusily employed in repairing the piece oftapestry which was spread on it which exhibitedseveral deplorable fissures enough todemand the utmost skill of the most expertseamstressit is to be remarked that it was by stolenglances that roland grasme contrived toascertain these interesting particulars andhe thought he could once or twice notwithstandingthe texture of the veil detectthe damsel in the act of taking similar cognizanceof his own person the matronsin the meanwhile continued their separateconversation eyeing from time to time theyoung people in a manner which left rolandin no doubt that they were the subjectof their conversation at length he distinctlyheard magdalen graeme say thesethe abbot words nay my sister we must give themopportunity to speak together and to becomeacquainted they must be personallyknown to each other or how shall theybe able to execute what they are entrustedwith it seemed as if the matron not fully satisfiedwith her friend's reasoning continuedto offer some objections but theywere borne down by her more dictatorialfriend it must be so she said my dearsister let us therefore go forth on thebalcony to finish our conversation anddo you she said addressing roland andthe girl become acquainted with eachotherwith this she stepped up to the youngwoman and raising her veil discoveredfeatures which whatever might be theirordinary complexion were now coveredwith a universal blushlibitum sit said magdalen looking atthe other matron the abbor viw licittun replied the other with reluctantand hesitating acquiescence andagain adjusting the veil of the blushing girlshe dropped it so as to shade though notto conceal her countenance and whisperedto her in a tone loud enough for the pageto hear remember catherine who thouart and for what destinedthe matron then retreated with magdalengreene through one of the casementsof the apartment that opened on a largebroad balcony which with its ponderousbalustrade had once run along the wholesouth front of the building which faced tothe brook and formed a pleasant and commodiouswalk in the open air it was nowin some places deprived of the balustradein others broken and narrowed but ruinousas it was could still be used as a pleasantpromenade here then walked thetwo ancient dames busied in their privateconversation yet not so much so but whatroland could observe the matrons as theirthe abbor thin forms darkened the casement in passingor repassing before it dart a glance intothe apartment to see how matters weregoing on there the ajbbptchapter xilife hath its may and all is mirthful then the woods are vocal and the flowers all odour its very blast has mirth isn't and the maidensthe while they don their cloaks to

awkwardness like that in whichshe was suddenly left to make acquaintancewith a handsome youth not even known toher by name struck her in spite of herselfin a ludicrous point of view she bent herbeautiful eyes upon the work with whichshe was busied and with infinite gravitysate out the two first turns of the matronsupon the balcony j but then glancing herthe abbot deep blue eye a little towards roland andobserving the embarrassment under whichhe laboured now shifting on his chair andnow dangling his cap the whole man evincingthat he was perfectly at a loss howto open the conversation she could keepher composure no longer but after a vainstruggle broke out into a sincere thougha very involuntary fit of laughing so richlyaccompanied by the laughter of her merryeyes which actually glanced through thetears which the effort filled them withand by the waving of her rich tressesthat the goddess of smiles herself neverlooked more lovely than catherine at thatmoment a court page would not haveleft her long alone in her mirth but rolandwas countrybred and besides havingsome conceit as well as bashfulnesshe took it into his head that he was himselfthe object of her inextinguishable laughterhis endeavours to sympathize with catherinetherefore could carry him no furtherthan into a forced giggle which had morek the abbotof displeasure than of mirth in it and whichso much enhanced that of the girl that itseemed to render it impossible for her everto bring her laughter to an end with whateveranxious pains she laboured to do sofor every one has felt that when a paroxysmof laughter has seized him at a misbecomingtime and place the efforts whichhe makes to suppress it nay the very senseof the impropriety of giving way to it tendsonly to augment and prolong the irresistibleimpulseit was undoubtedly lucky for catherineas well as for roland that the latter didnot share in the excessive mirth of the formerfor seated as she was with her backto the casement catherine could easilyescape the observation of the two matronsduring the course of their promenade whereas graeme was so placed with hisside to the window that his mirth had heshared that of his companion would havebeen instantly visible and could not havefailed to give offence to the personages inthe abbot question he sate however with some impatienceuntil catherine had exhaustedeither her power or her desire of laughingand was returning with good grace to theexercise of her needle and then he observedwith some dryness that there seemed nogreat occasion to recommend to them toimprove their acquaintance it seemed thatthey were already tolerably familiarcatherine had an extreme desire to setoff upon a fresh score but she repressed itstrongly and fixing her eyes on her workreplied by asking his pardon and promisingto avoid future offenceroland had sense enough to feel thatan air of offended dignity was very muchmisplaced and that it was with a very differentbearing he ought to meet the deepblue eyes which had borne such a heartyburthen in the laughing scene he triedtherefore to extricate himself as well as hecould from his blunder by assuming a toneof correspondent gaiety and requesting toknow of the nymph how it was her pleadsthe abbotsure that they should proceed in improvingthe acquaintance which had commenced somerrilythat she said you must yourselfdiscover perhaps i have gone a step too farin opening our interview suppose said roland graeme weshould begin as in a talebook by askingeach others names and histories it is right well

dwell in theworld for i at least cannot dispense withthe rules to which i am vowed because itis the will of wicked men to break down thesanctuary in which they wont to be observedthe abbot it is well my sister replied magdalen to pay each even the smallest tythesof mint and cummin which the church demandsand i blame not thy scrupulous observanceof the rules of thine order butthey were established by the church andfor the church's benefit and reason it isthat they should give way when the salvationof the church herself is at stakethe abbess made no replyone more acquainted with human naturethan

wider field of effort and would notbe limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinaryschemes which were suggested by her the abbotbold and irregular imagination but rolandgraeme instead of tracing these peculiaritiesof character in the two old damesonly waited with great anxiety for the returnof catherine expecting probably thatthe proposal of the fraternal embrace wouldbe renewed as his grandmother seemed disposedto carry matters with a high handhis expectations or hopes if we maycall them so were however disappointed for when catherine reentered on thesummons of the abbess and placed on thetable an earthen pitcher of water and fourwooden platters with cups of the same materialsthe dame of heathergill satisfiedwith the arbitrary mode in which she hadborne down the opposition of the abbesspursued her victory no farther a moderationfor which her grandson in his heartreturned her but slender thanksin the meanwhile catherine continued toplace upon the table the slender preparationsfor the meal of a recluse which consistedalmost entirely of cole wort boiledthe abbot and served up in an earthen platter havingno better seasoning than a little salt and nobetter accompaniment than some coarsebarleybread in very moderate quantitythe waterpitcher already mentioned furnishedthe only beverage after a latingrace delivered by the abbess the guestssat down to their

cheer sir halbert glendiningwho affected even an unusual degreeof nobleness in his housekeeping maintainedit in a style of genial hospitalitywhich rivalled that of the northern baronsof england he

consumption of his domesticsand retainers and in this scene of plentyhad roland graeme now lived for severalyears it formed a bad introduction to lukewarmgreens and spring water and probablyhis countenance indicated some senseof the difference for the abbess observed it would seem my son that the tablesof the heretic baron whom you have solong followed are more daintily furnishedthan those of the suffering daughters of thechurch and yet not upon the roost solemnnights of festival when the nuns were permittedto eat their portion at mine own tabledid i consider the cates which werethen served up as half so delicious as thesevegetables and this water on which i preferto feed rather than do aught which mayderogate from the strictness of my vow itshall never be said that the mistress of thishouse made it a house of feasting when daysthe abbot of darkness and of affliction were hangingover the holy church of which i am anunworthy memberwell hast thou said my sister repliedmagdalen graeme but now it is not onlytime to suffer in the good cause but to actin it and since our pilgrim's meal is finishedlet us go apart to prepare for our journeyof tomorrow and to advise on themanner in which these children shall be employedand what measures we can adopt tosupply their thoughtlessness and lack of discretionnotwithstanding his indifferent cheertheheart of roland graeme bounded high atthis proposal which he doubted not wouldlead to another teteastute betwixt him andthe pretty novice but he was mistakencatherine it would seem had no mind sofarto indulge him for moved either by delicacyor caprice or some of those indescribableshades betwixt the one and the otherwith which women love to teaze and at thesame time to captivate the ruder sex shel the abbotreminded the abbess that it was necessaryshe should retire for an hour before vespers and receiving the ready and approvingnod of her superior she arose towithdraw but before leaving the apartmentshe made obeisance to the matronsbending herself till her hands touched herknees and then made a slighter reverenceto roland which consisted in a slight bendof the body and gentle depression of thehead this she performed very demurely but the party on whom the salutation wasconferred thought he could discern in hermanner an arch and mischievous exultationover his secret disappointment the deviltake the saucy girl he

reposed were mingledwith those of the saints and angels of thegothic chisel which the hand of violencehad sent headlong from their stationsthe most fatal symptom of the whole appearedto be that though this violence hadnow been committed for many months thefathers had lost so totally all heart and resolveabbot lotion that they had not adventured evenupon clearing away the rubbish or restoringthe church to some decent degree of orderthis might have been done without muchlabour but terror had overpowered thescanty remains of a body once so powerfuland sensible they were only suffered to remainin this ancient seat by connivance andfrom compassion they'd not venture upontaking any step which might be construedinto an assertion of their ancient rightscontenting themselves with the secret andobscure exercise of their religious ceremonialin as unostentatious a manner as waspossibletwo or three of the more aged brethrenhad sunk under the pressure of the timesand the ruins had been

periodduring which the abbacy remained vacantwas a state of mourning or as their emblematicalphrase expressed it of widowhood a melancholy term which was changed intorejoicing and triumph when a new superiorwas chosen when the foldingdoorswere on such solemn occasions thrownopen and the new abbot appeared on thethreshold in fullblown dignity with ringand mitre and dalmatia and crosier hishoary standardbearers and his juvenile dispensersof incense preceding him and thevenerable train of monks behind him withallbesides which could announce the supremeauthority to which he was now raisedhis appearance was a signal for the magnificentjubilate to rise from the organ andmusicloft and to be joined by the correspondingbursts of hallelujah from the wholeassembled congregation now all was changedin the midst of rubbish and desolation the abbotseven or eight old men bent and shaken asmuch by grief and fear as by age shroudedhastily in the proscribed dress of their orderwandered like a procession of spectres fromthe door which had been thrown open upthrough the encumbered passage to thehigh altar there to instal their elected superiora chief of ruins it was like a bandof bewildered travellers chusing a chief inthe wilderness of arabia or a shipwreckedcrew electing a captain upon the barrenisland on which fate has thrown themthey who in peaceful times are mostambitious of authority among others shrinkfrom the competition at such eventful periodswhen neither ease nor parade attendthe possession of it and when it gives onlya painful preeminence both in danger andin labour and exposes the ill fated chieftainto the murmurs of his discontented associatesas well as to the first assault of thecommon enemy but he on whom the officeof the abbot of saint mary's was nowconferred had a mind fitted for the situatheabbot tion to which he was called bold and enthusiasticyet generous and forgiving wise and skilful yet zealous and prompt he wanted but a better cause than the supportof a decaying superstition to haveraised him to the rank of a truly great manbut as the end crowns the work it alsoforms the rule by which it must be ultimatelyjudged and those who with sincerityand generosity fight and fall in anevil cause posterity can only compassionateas victims of a generous but fatal erroramongst these we must rank ambrosiusthe last abbot of kennaquhair whose designsmust be condemned as their successwould have rivetted on scotland the chainsof antiquated superstition and spiritual tyranny but whose talents in themselvescommanded respect and whose virtueseven from the enemies of his faith extortedesteemthe bearing of the new abbot served ofitself to dignify a ceremonial which was deprivedof all other attributes of grandeur the abbotconscious of the peril in which they stoodand recalling doubtless the better daysthey had seen there hung over his brethrenan appearance of mingled terror andgrief and shame which induced them tohurry over the office in which they wereengaged as something at once degradingand dangerousbut not so father ambrose his featuresindeed expressed a deep melancholyas he walked up the centre aisleamid the ruins of things which he consideredas holy but his brow was undetectedand his step firm and solemn heseemed to think that the dominion whichhe was about to receive depended in nosort upon the external circumstances underwhich it was conferred and if a mindso firm was accessible to sorrow or fear itwas not on his own account but on that ofthe church to which he had devoted himselfat length he stood on the broken stepsof the high altar barefooted as was thethe abbot rule and holding in his hand his pastoralstaff for the gemmed ring and jewelledmitre had become secular spoils no obedientvassals came man after man to maketheir homage and to offer the tribute whichshould provide their spiritual superior withpalfrey and trappings no bishop assistedat the solemnity to receive into thehigher

youths who were impatient to setout on a hunting party than as if it madethe most solemn part of a solemn ordinationthe officiating priest faultered as hespoke the service and often looked around the abboras if he expected to be interrupted in themidst of his office and the brethren listenedas to that which short as it was theywished yet more abridgedthese symptoms of alarm increased asthe ceremony proceeded and as it seemedwere not caused by mere apprehensionalone for amid the pauses of the hymnthere were heard without sounds of a verydifferent sort beginning faintly and at adistance but at length approaching closeto the exterior of the church and stunningwith dissonant clamour those engaged inthe service the winding of horns blownwith no regard to harmony or concert thejangling of bells the thumping of drumsthe squeaking of bagpipes and the clash ofcymbals the shouts of a multitude nowas in laughter now as in anger the shrilltones of female voices and of those of

extraordinary interruptionwill be explained in the nextchapter the abbotchapter xivnot the wild billow when it breaks its barrier not the wild wind escaping from its cavern not the wild fiend that

song which likethat of the choristers in the legend of thewitch of berkeley died away in a quaver ofconsternation j and like a flock of chickensdisturbed by the presence of the kite theyat first made a movement to disperse andfly in different directions and then withdespair rather than hope huddled themselvesaround their new abbot who retainingthe lofty and undismayed look whichhad dignified him

saturnalianlicenses as the inhabitants of and the neighbourhood had nowin hand and that the vulgar on such occasionswhere not only permitted but encouragedby a number of gambols sometimespuerile and ludicrous sometimes immoraland profane to indemnify themselves forthe privations and penances imposed ontiem at other seasons but of all otherthe abbot topics for burlesque and ridicule the ritesand ceremonial of the church itself weremost frequently resorted to and strangeto say with the approbation of the clergythemselveswhile the hierarchy flourished in fullglory they do not appear to have
