drop steals down the cheek beauty at the departure a

thanks for the sports that had been selected for his amusement
the tears stood in old hawthorn's eyes when he
grasped the hand his son and faintly articulated goodlye
 jeery felt rather ticklish but endeavoured to preserve
his firmness the domestics also respectfully wished him a
pleasant journey when off they started bowing to their
friends till they lost sight hawthorn hall london now
was the only object before them and the anticipation 
enjoying the company his lovely kate and the facetious
bob logic in a few fleeting hours stole across tom's mind
with increased effect whue jerry in raptures frequently
burst out humming the last line his cousin's song 
london london town for me they pursued their journey
as fast as the horses could go and every milestone was
hailed with pleasure as it brought them nearer to the metropolis
nothing importance occurred on the road and
after a few changes horses jerry found himself sitting
comfortably by the side tom at corinthian house
chapter viii
jerry an intimate corinthian house its taste and elegance
described useful hints front tom to jerry the
latter in training to become a swell his introduction to
bois logic a ride in rotten row
with many persons it should seem to know the
world consists in knowing how to get money to
know how to purchase annuities and estates to know how
the stocks fluctuate to know how to juggle with the jugglers
 change alley and to know how to make a large fortune 
with others the grand secret appears to be to know how to
tceep it after it has been obtained this sort knowledge
however was not the forte corinthian tom nor his
friend logic on the contrary no persons knew better than
they did how to spend a fortune seeing life was their
object to keep all sorts company to admire an accomplished
mind whenever they found it to respect and follow
notions real gentility and to select the most sensible and
agreeable persons in society as their companions to see this
sort life was what induced jerry to leave hawthorn
hall there was no sophistry attached to his character he
came to london with an impatient ardour to join in the fun 
to enjoy the lartc to laugh at the sees and to be aliaje in all
his rambles it appears however his highest object was
improvement intending to return to hawthorn hall
 life in l london
somewhat wmr than when he left it to possess a more
correct knowledge the various classes society and a
more enlarged acquaintance with men and manners
to see life then was the primary consideration 
jeery hawthorn but it was not to agree with every
disposition and conform with every species behaviour
totally inconsistent with the tenets reason prudence and
good manners neither was it to ridicule all sober welldisposed
persons as people wholly unfit to live in the world
it was not that sort life that encouraged individuals
to drink very hard to swear a good round hand to sing an
indecent song or to be smutty and fulsome in discourse
it was not to mimic and tale offsach as have unhappily
an impediment in their speech to be excessively droll in
remarks on those who are disfigured through any natural
defect or to look on every person as a fool that has any
regard for region
it was not to be loose in morals wanton in debauchery
and horrid in imprecations to appear learned in everything
allied to obscenity and lewdness and in everything else to
appear as ignorant as a person might please
it was not to know or pretend to know all the young
ladies in town and should you discover any one two or
three them to have conceived an affection for you to
endeavour to debauch them all and if you are so happy as to
succeed then to forsake and expose them by way gratitude
for the favours they had bestowed
it was not to belong to drinking clubs sporting clubs or
jerry in training for a swell 
debating societies to go often to the playhouses and there
always to distinguish yourself as highly as possible in assuming
every freakish air and saucy attitude andwhen profound
attention is required for the hearing any fine and pathetic
speech to be suddenly seized with a loud fit coughing to
clap like a hero at what you should not and hiss at what you
do not understand
it was not to go to taverns coffeehouses and places illfame
to commit every sort outrage and disorder such as
jumping about the rooms putting out the candles spilling the
liquors breaking the glasses kicking the waiters c c
it was not to frequent places fashionable resort and to
fegp it up all night in drinking swearing and singing and
when fair morn makes her approach then heroically to sally
forth into the street reel about like a rake the first
magnitude insult all you meet knock down au old woman
or two break a few windows stagger to another tavern for a
fresh supply the juice the grape and finish your glorious
frolic in being sent home in a hackneycoach senseless speechless
and motionless more like a beast than a rational intelligent
human being
the passions are all prone to sad disorders
whose objects never should approach their orders i
lead us not into temptation 
is a choice prayer and which i much admire 
so many things are dangerous to desire 
so ripe for foul assassination 
todths whene'er the wishes warm nature
tumultuous rise destroy their dangerous dance
the curb reason to your aid advance
and some them with her inches scold water
 life in london
no harm is in the passions to be sure
but then they must not gallop wild to door 
close keep them just ike hounds that long for hare
or muzzle them indeed like ferrets
and thus suppress their wanton spirits
that lawless wish to be as free as air
the passions as i ve said are far from eiiil
but if not well confined they play the devil
learn from that candle mark its governed frame
how in its lustre gentle steady tame
so mild such trembling modesty so quiet 
but let him touch your curtains on your bed
who on such stuff delighteth to be fed
lo in a brace minutes what a riot 
he pulls for nought the unbridled rogue reveres
like samson an old house about his ears
jerry had now realised the summit ms wishes in being
happily situated under the roof his relative at corinthian
house the elegance his cousin's appearance had often
excited lies praise and admiration but he was now altogether
as much delighted nay astonished at the superlative style
which tom had displayed in decorating the interior his
mansion and some little time had elapsed before jerry's
eyes grew familiar to the grandeur and dazzling objects with
which he was surrounded indeed to describe the numerous
beauties corinthian house contained would require a complete
and extensive catalogue it was a perfect model a
combination taste and excellence there was nothing
superfluous about it yet nothing was wanting all that art
could produce had been effected regulated by a sound and
critical judgment every room had its character and all
 them were emphatic in the selection paintings exhibited
upon one side the picture gallery a correct knowledge 
the old masters had been displayed it was admitted by all the
jerry in training for a swell 
connoisseurs who had seen them upon the other side 
this splendid apartment the contrast was equally fine and
attractive the beauties the modern school op painting
rising proudly in an improved state grandeur were
viewed challenging as it were the old masters to the scale
 competition the works sir joshua reynolds west
lawrence fuseli opine stall gainsborough loutherbourg
the eccentric barry beechy turner wilkie haydn c
c shone forth in all that vigour expression softness 
touch and brilliancy colouring which gave a character to
that era painting so highly distinguished during the reign
 our muchlamented and revered monarch george the third
the founder the royal academy jerry was at a complete
standstill between these two great magnets attraction he
was no connoisseur yet he used to observe to tom there was
a certain something about the paintings that seemed
almost to fasten him to the spot
in the sketchroom which was principally dedicated to
the productions the late george norland jerry was
rather more if not quite at home almost skipping with rapture
as his eye ran over the subjects that unrivalled genius 
the pencil nature was seen so strongly at every touch that
 the works this distinguished painter and his gieat eccentricity 
character were often the subjects conversation between corinthian
tom and his visitors jeeet laughed heartily on being told by his coz
that eaekt who lived like a hermit entirely by himself in a very
capacious house on the delphi terrace in order to save the expense 
repairing a broken pane glass placed a most beautiful painting the
value five hundred guineas against the window to keep out the cold
and the rain this great artist was the intimate friend the late edmund
burke esq and so delighted was barry with the work on the sublime
and beautiful when it was first shown to him in manuscript that he
literally copied every word it for his own use
 life in london
jerry nearly fancied himself again at hawthorn hall
looking at his dogs pigs and horses
it was the opinion corinthian tom in his remarks to
jerry when the latter first entered this apartment that if
norland had only painted half the number subjects which
are now before the public their value might have been
enhanced twice as much and finished pictures instead 
sketches most likely would have been the result this was
the reason tom assigned to jerry for having it called the
sketchroom nine times out ten said tom dull
matteroffact calculation is not allied with genius money
to george norland was a colour that he did not paint with 
and therefore respecting its value he seemed to know nothing
embarrassment and the catchpoles first drew up the curtain
and showed him the iron bars which stopped his thoughtless
career they also explained to him in the most feeling
manner the uses a strong lock they likewise pointed out
to george the difference his prospects not in an artistlike
manner to his mind's eye but in a clear distinct way 
business that twenty shillings make a pound for the orient
he keenly felt the disgusting cramped situation carey street
which compelled him io peep at his objects through the iron
rails his apartment for the moment also he felt the immediate
necessity procuring the gold talismanic key to give
him once more his liberty again to wander amidst the beauties
 nature it was then that norland painted for money it
was then that genius was in fetters it was then that rapid
exertions got the better his taste the instance speaks forcibly
for itself the sooner you joint me a picture mr
norland said the leary bumtrap the sooner the door
will be open to you freedom is in view and i discharge
your debt no skilful angler ever threw his une into the
jerry in training for a swell 
water with a more coaxing bait to hook the poor fish than mr
screw tried it on with his prisoner it was plausible it
was better it gave no trouble to his acquaintance it also
prevented shyness or refusal from his friends the lockup
house by such means lost its terrors employment was
found for the mind and pencil norland he experienced
no shivering the body no feverish parchedup tongue
waiting with the most anxious suspense for the return the
messenger to bring the no which ultimately sent him to jailor
the delightful yes that set the prisoner once more at
liberty on the contrary george was quite at home he
did as his inclinations prompted him jolly fellows called on
him in abundance and the song and the glass went round
with the freedom a tavern all his wants were supplied
and the misery a spunginghouse was not seen in morlajsid's
apartment in fact he was better attended than when out 
it from the top screws to the stampercleaner all them felt
an interest in waiting upon the great genius as he was
termed in order to take a sly ieep at his paintings here
george set no price to his pictures but when he was tired
 his companions and his confined situation he then industriously
and in a short time painted himself out the lockup
house lumbering him never afterwards gave norland any
horrors and whenever ho was again in trouble the same kind
 judgment was repeated time and often till mr screw had
realised a tolerable collection valuable paintings this
oflscer was rather fond pictures himself but when any
gentleman took a fancy to purchase any them mr screw
never betrayed a want knowledge their value by the
prices he affixed to them norland died at a premature
age j dissipated habits proved his quietus the ruder scenes

 nature were his hobby genteel life was too dull too
insipid for his pence but a more independent mind never
had an existence and his good qualities were numerous the
taproom he preferred to the parlour too much assumption
 wouldbe politeness and selfimportance he thought frequently
decorated the latter whue the former furnished
nothing else but originality character the coalheaver
cooking his own meat and taking the ling out a pot 
porter at one pull the carman tossing off a glass gin like
water and the needy woman balladsinger going from house
to house attempting to get a halfpenny out some poor
tradesman for a song were the sort groups that fastened on
the mind norland he never felt more happy than when
he was seen amongst them he depicted their various traits
and peculiarities in the most glowing colours and he has left
them behind him living as it were on his canvas a monument
 his unrivalled talents in a peculiar style painting
to the saloon the walls which were completely covered
with the most highlyfinished engravings executed in the
metropolis jerry often repaired when a few leisure moments
offered to contemplate such an inimitable collection portraits
 public characters over harlowe's trial scene 
queen katherine before henry the eighth and wilkie's
this apartment had been christened a long time before jbekt
arrived in town by logic the acquaintance eoom bob would
frequently catch hold jeeky by the arm after they had become intimate
and ask mm to take a turn among their acquaintances for bo he
denominated most those characters such as mr kean mr brougham
miss o'neill miss key c who averse continually appearing before the
eye the public it was from the remarks loglo that jeret picked
up considerable information respecting the above sort persons
 the death this young artist from the extraordinary talents he
possessed has been considered an irreparable loss to the arts
jerry in training for a swell 
blind fiddler and the wentday jerry was frequently witnessed
rubbing his hands with delight at their excellence
the drawingroom was noble grand and impressive
the llbraky however interesting was attractive from the
superior bindings the books which caught the eyes the
spectators upon their entering it yet upon a more close
examination by the lovers literature it discovered that a
mind had not been wanting in the proprietor in the selection
 the works it contained
the portfolio caricatures including the whole the fine
and extensive collection gilray's works often afforded
great fun and laughter for jerry vhile the inimitable woodcuts
which tom had been rather prodigal in getting together
by way a sdoff astonished jerry at the great perfection
which had been attained in this curious and interesting branch
 the arts
the conversation eoom was equally as elegant and
impressive as the other apartments it was the gigshop 
 the visitants but denominated by bob logic the bay 
condolences short the tout eiisemile corinthian house
operated so imposingly upon the feelings those persons 
 this room had a variety names its godfathers were also numerous
the bay condolence as logic termed it had afforded him consolation
from his pals during the relation many his nightly adventures and
misfortunes jerut used to style it harvest home from the numerous
good things which were served up in it and from the continual
hus he had to encounter when any the hon vivants dropped in to have
a bit chitchat tom designated this apartment the chaffing crib j
but it derived its climax from the highlifeidowstairs gentry who
whispered it one to another as hell bkoee loose

fashion who had been permitted a sight its interior that in
their instructions to the upholsterer as far as the inside 
this magnificent dwelling could be imitated the general
expression was i should like to have my house fitted up
exactly after the style corinthian tom's 
jerry was taking a sly peep at himself in an elegant 
that reflected his whole length person when tom
suddenly broke in upon him and clapping his hand upon his
cousin's shoulder exclaimed with a smile 
we must assume a style if we have it not 
jerry rather confusedly replied i understand you i must
send for your tailor to give me a new touch that shall be
done without delay said tom mr primefit regent

 life in london
the latter hero gave rather a graceful noi in return for this
unexpected complimentwhich it should seem augured to
tom a kind budding the lively genius his cousin's
mind the corinthian had just ordered his servant to
hiring him tie weekly dispatch to see how sporting matters
had been going on in the metropolis during his absence from
town ashen mr primefit was announced to mr hawthorn
to be in waiting to receive his commands
mr primefit according to the countertalking part the
community had done all his dirty avork and among the
needles at the west the town who must sport a
genteel outside no matter at whose suit it was observed
between a grin and a pun that he had not only got rid all
his lad habits but had likewise outlived his sufferings
it was said this celebrated apparel furnisher that if he
received the cash for one coat out three nothing alas the
matter in his intercourse with people fashion the
character that ran before him was a perfectly gentleman
tradesman he had one point in view on setting out in life
and he never lost sight it to ask his customers for payment
was to lose their custom though for the first seven
years dickey primefit was engaged in cuttingup his cloth
hurried beyond measure yet those troublesome customers
 otherwise sharps i have not been exactly able to ascertain whether
this phrase originated with a punster but it must be admitted it does
not want for point
 tom shufieton just as we talk to one another about our coats 
we never say who a your tailor we always ask who suffers 
john bull
 this certainly must be viewed as an improvement in phraseology
intercourse is a soft stylish and pleasant word there is nothing plebeian
or waiterfca about it
jerry in training for a swell i
john doe and richard boe were continually at his elbow
judging him to take measure their suits in preference to
every other person his law expenses and mtjm tip inconsequence
were frightful yet ticket braved the fury 
the woollen draper's storm with the utmost composure
with a placid countenance he never refused credit to any
british ofscer either in the sea or land service let the distance
or uncertainty the expedition be what it might the
reference one gentleman to another was quite sufficient to
mr peimefit and the garments were made and sent home
without further inquiry or delay course in return the
charges dickey were never overhauled indeed what
gentleman would have behaved so ungentlemanly to a tradesman
who was all civility politeness and accommodation from
one his patterncard to the other the business mr
prdiefit therefore became so extensive that he sent clothes
to all parts the world in london no gentleman who had
been once in the books dickey would listen to the name
 silence t how extremely poztjc and j'otrfenifmz to inform an individual
that lie will be wanted on such a particular day instead dragging
lii away from lira business and amoy and locking him up like a felon
besides making a hus about his premises which not only knocks up his
credit in his neighbourhood but spoils his reputation at a distance why
such accommodation is worth any tip it is a multum in pavo trait 
life in london
tis gold
which buys admittance oft it doth yea make
diana's rangers false themselves and yield up
their deer to the stand o th stealer and tis gold
which makes the true man killed and saves the thief 
nay sometimes hangs both thief and true man what
can it not do and undo 
but after all it must be viewed as a most liberal accommodation to the
unfortunate but embarrassed debtors and such secrecy has rendered the
most important services to thousands persona in the metropolis
iso life in london
 any other tailor which rendered peimefit the go for a
tasty cut best materials and firstrate workmanship dickey
had a soul above buttons he had no narrow ideas belonging
to him and he flattered himself that ultimately it would
all be right no gentleman mr primefit would often assert
when he has been blamed for giving such an extensive loose
sort credit i am convinced but will act as such sooner or
later towards me f so it proved things at length took
the expected turn many long outstanding bills came in
his capital accumulated his business also increased in so
extraordinary a manner that several clerks were necessary to
keep it in order and ensure punctuality dickey was almost
as true as a clock to his time in attending to orders his
character for fashion was so emphatic that numbers stylish
tradesmen who found it necessary to have a uttermost
coat by them for high days and holidays regardless 
the charge employed mr prbiefit the sunshine prosperity
was now so complete that not a single bumtrap had
crossed the threshold dickey's door in the way private
business for many a long day past in short mr peimefit
had realised the climax his exertions he had measured his
way into a carriage dickey was principally distinguished
for the cut his coats to coeinthian tom he was peculiarly
indebted as a leader the fashion it was owing to
this circumstance that mr peimefit waited in person at
corinthian house indeed the active use the scissors and
parchment had long been removed from the hands dickey
and his principal occupation now consisted in talking over the
versatility fashion to his customers and giving directions
to his men but the slightest idea that might drop from
coeinthian tom respecting the advantages dress was what
dickey could not resist and he therefore ordered his carriage
immediately to attend upon our rustic hero
jerry in training for a swell lr
tom and jekky previously to the arrival the apparelfurnished
had been discussing the advantages resulting from
dress and address and the corinthian had also been pointing
out to his coz not to skim too lightly over so important a
subject but to peruse with the most marked attention that
grand living books 
man 
it is worthy my dear jerry to cherish the poet's observation
to its utmost extent said tom that the consideration
 that noblest animals is one the most proper studies
which belong to the education an individual it is our
duty to trace him through the various avenues that lead to his
elevation and it is also incumbent upon us to penetrate into the
dark paths which ultimately bring man into a degraded state
the comparisons many men so often impressed on my
memory by my late worthy father now flash across my
recollection so strongly that i will repeat them for your
instruction jerry and though rather odd were not altogether
perhaps unjust some them he thought bore a likeness
to a badlywritten dramatic piece decorated with the most
fascinating scenery and captivating music and many the
audience upon retiring to their closets have felt a sort 
vexation in being lulled off their guards by such gaudy allurements
or that delusion could have been dressed up so speciously
as to have overcome the advantages common sense just
so it was my father's opinion concerning dress address and
eloquence and he thought lord chesterfield had too often
been prophetic in declaring a prepossessing appearance to be
very imposing and capable performing wonders as it
proved frequently the fact that mankind are so much dazzled
with the exterior as not to trouble themselves about any
further consideration the object before them have we not
experienced said my father that many our most trifling

from the hearers for so good a man yet be not

different in character as light is to dark

and do not think that in a little time you vnw be up to everything
 or to use a current expression among the knowing ones
do not let it be said you sneeringly that you are quarter
flash and three parts foolish this is the common
error most the darlings and swell acids the metropolis
split upon in flattering yourself that you are knowing
 i cannot but think that this expression corinthian tom's must
be viewed as a prejudice though it might claim pardon as an
honourable one would not la flew have expressed himself as warmly
in favour paris who s to decide but to cut the matter short the
spaniard would doubtless give the preference to madrid the italian

egotism pride myself in the above instance in having strictly
adhered to an honourable line conduct i have only one
more remark by way a finisher said tom smiling when
once jerry you have been queered upon any event remember
it in future for as my friend bob logic says it is a
good flat that is never downs bythebye i
there are numerous persons in the world that never can be convinced

shall introduce you to him you will find logic a most
interesting humorous fellow full anecdote and having

mr pkimefit was now ushered into the chafing crib to
receive the necessary instructions for the swell suit from the
corinthian and jerry was also in preparation to undergo
the tactics and small talk the above celebrated artists
the choice the patterncard had already been disposed 
but to procure that certain sort a cut which tends to
give the hero the hole a gentleman was rather too important
a nature to be despatched without some consideration
it was however obtained but mr primefit was longer than
usual in his operations as his eyes were continually wandering
among the great variety new paintings which had been
introduced since his last visit to corinthian house indeed it
was a most attractive apartment and some little allowance
might be made for the unsteadiness the tailor's optics the
o their errors these are the sort oijlats that the cup and ball claps like
who will play and stand the grin till they are completely cleaned out
and have not a mag left to help themselves with
 under such hands jekby bid fair soon to get rid his rustic habits
or perhaps it might be more correct to observe in training under the
auspices corinthian tom in order to become a swell a good
appearance all other considerations if not absolutely the first is
however deemed one the principal requisites in high life to loot the
character a gentleman
this term it should seem had given great offence to several gentlemen
 the lyrusli who frequented the chaffing orb but logic insisted
that the point the thing bore him out mr pkimefit was a person that
made use colours in his profession and about his works ligju and shade
were also skilfully displayed he was likewise a man taste and that
he possessed a knowledge the human figure could not be denied

sufficiently glowing in its representation to give the spectator
some idea its imposing appearance during the time mr
peimefit was applying the measure to ascertain the frame

lusty unsubdued hack his merry rustic coz at the same
time making comparisons in his own mind at the vast
difference the hinder parts his zajzrfylike friends at the
westend the town when jut into the scale against the
country breed jerry tom laughingly told prdiefit
that he had not been so well lacked for a long time the
knight the thimble gave a polite nod assent and he had
scarcely obscured his card made his exit and stopped into his
carriage when logic with the freedom an old friend came
running into the room and sans ceremonie began addressing
the corinthian with my dear tom i am glad to see you
returned to town positively your absence has made a complete
blank in the fashionable circles but i have to congratulate
you upon your looking so well this journey has
put you all to rights it has indeed replied tom j but
let me first introduce to your notice my doctors jerry hawthorn
esq to whom i am indebted for a principal part 
my renovation and for the possession a good heart an
 it was considered a good idea the corinthian to have every article
that was new first placed in the chaffing crib to undergo the ordeal the
visitors and then if pronounced the thing i it was removed to another
apartment to remain as a fixture while on the contrary if the article
excited no interest it was removed altogether eut nine times out 
tes the taste tom was admitted to he genuine
 to the cheerful pleasant exercise which tom enjoyed in the company
and sporting pursuits jeeby during his residence at hawthorn hall

excellent pair heels with hands not idle nor deficient when
any occasion may require the use them you wil find my
cousin not wanting and jerry in your becoming acquainted
with my friend egbert logic esq i have to inform you
that his lead contains all the treasures i beg pardon smiling
all the larks oxford you will not only find in him a
complete map the metropolis as to peculiar points and
situations but likewise a pocketdictionary respecting many
 the living characters it contains therefore between you
both you may chaff hit and run with the gayest boys in our
circle acquaintances but use him well bob and remember
that he is not yet out pupil's straits and must not as you
say be bloivn up at point nonplus jerry was quite in
the dark as to these latter phrases and appeared rather
embarrassed till logic gave him a friendly grasp the hand
and told him he should soon be quite au fait nth them and
many more in less than a month he then took his leave in
the same light airy and gay manner that he entered observing
he should expect to see them both in the park on the
following sunday we shall be there replied tom
the swell suit had been received at gminthian house and
the rustic habits jerry were removed altogether mr
pribiefit had most satisfactorily performed his task tom
also expressed his approbation that so much attention had
been paid to his orders and hawthorn felt quite pleased
with the talents displayed by his apparel furnisher and he
scarcely knew himself as his eye ran over the mirror which
reflected the elegant metamorphose he had undergone
my dear jerry said tom our horses will soon be
ready and we shall then start off for what i term the showshop
 the metropolis hyde park which is in my opinion
 life in london
one the most delightful scenes in the world indeed it is a
fine picture the english people
can europe or the world produce
alike for omawmt or debauch

such specimens order dkzss

as here displayed the summer sun
lingering seems proud to shine upon 
it is in this park jerry that the prince may be seen
dressed as plain as the most humble individual in the kingdom
the tradesman more stylish in his apparel than his
lordship and the showman with as fine clothes on his personas
a duke the countess not half so much bedizened
over as her own waitingmaid the apprentice boy as sprucely
set offas a young sprig nobility while the milliner s lass
in finery excels the duchess but the air independence
which each person seems to breathe renders the tout ensemble
captivating
the same pursuits together jumble
the rich and poor the proud and jumble
the enfranchised tradesman if he stirs
yere jostles half his customers
here in a rage the bond street spark
is hearted by his father's clerk 
while yon proud dame sad event is

the servant announced the horses to be in waiting at the
door when tom and jerey without delay started off to join
the gay throng promenading up and down in the showshop
as they rode along through the streets the corinthian
goodnaturedly hinted to jerry to avoid if possible
the too common but vulgar practice turning round to look
back after any person whom he might polit out to his notice
jerry returned his coz thanks for his friendly and welltimed
advice and tom pushed forward
to join his cronies in the park

jerry as he entered the gates the park operated rather
strongly upon his feelings the long line splendid
equipages rattling along passing and repassing each other
under the guidance charioteers the highest blood and
pedigree the prime hits blood from the choicest studs
in the kingdom prancing about as proud as peacocks and
 the emperor russia when on a visit to the king england

with the elegance the scene delighted the emperor beyond measure

nod to her friends in order to get rid her yawning and to

in full swing at the rate twenty miles an hour notoriety
here is everything and the various modes to obtain it are
so numerous that the eye is fatigued with the contrast

it and after all it is so fleeting a nature in london that
very few persons can flatter themselves on having notoriety

 it must be crowded walks positively a welldressed mob persons

tom and jerry had scarcely got into the ride in rotten
row when tom received a host nods and smiles from his
acquaintances but who had the corinthian with him was
the question that was the puzzle to be solved he is not
 london growth i m sure said the lively lady wanton
to her sister the hon miss satire as tom and jerry rode
by her carriage his ruddy unsophisticated huntsman's
face bespeaks him the tallyho sort he is rather a handsome
wellmade fellow an't he handsome indeed 
echoed miss satire accompanied with a most disdainful toss
 her head and putting up her glass and surveying poor
jerry from head to foot with a microscopic eye you
mean sister that he is decked out in elegant clothes but
from the awkwardness he displays in them the wearer seems
quite a stranger to such sort apparel indeed i think he
looks like one the tallylw sort as you call it one who has
left the rude company hounds and horses to tm with
genteel society under the patronage the corinthian 
fie replied lady wanton you are as usual illnatured
jerry in training for a swell 
in your remarks without a cause but i dare to say he is
rich however we shall know more about him when we see
trifle these and a thousand other whisper comments or
rather private attacks had jeeky to encounter unknowingly
as he passed up and down the ride
the duchess hearts in her open barouche came
dashing along the ride and upon her grace perceiving the
corinthian she gave him a most gracious smile tom
instantly made up to her carriage and with his usual happy
talent introduced to the duchess hearts his cousin
jerry hawthorn esq au eyes were now fixed upon the
carriage the duchess jerry came in for his share the
gaze as a new hero in the park and the crowd began to
assemble round her barouche poor jerry who could take
the most dangerous leaps without the slightest hesitation or
fear wrestle sing dance and talk with all the merry lads 
his village squeeze the hand and steal a kiss from the
vermilion lips mary rosebud in the vicinity hawthorn
hall with all the confidence a tom jones could not look
upon the face divine the duchess the rustic hero was
almost struck dumb and he appeared shy and embarrassed
the blaze beauty was too much for his feelings but it was
not beauty alone it was not the stilllife beauty the
sculptor and the artist there were no touches tameness
and insipidity about it it was not merely a beautiful index 
it had a corresponding heart the eyes spoke volumes 
intelligence but the smile that animated the features threw
such a bewitching fascinating air over the whole them as
to enrapture every beholder it was one nature's highly
finished pieces it was a composition excellence wit and
goodnature were seen as playful dimples and sensibility and
harmony gave a delightful lustre to every part the count
life in london
penance satire and art did not belong to this face indeed
the slightest glance it evinced that the outline was talent
the toutensemble was a spell that operated like enchantment
on the spectator but poor jerry was not the only man who
had felt embarrassed on being introduced to the duchess 
hearts no no numerous confident heroes men the
world too distinguished for superiority talent and who
had played the first fiddle in most other companies felt so
great an awe in her presence that long very long after they
had been permitted to mix in her circle friends they looked
upon a second situation in comparison with the witty enlightened
elegant and susceptible duchess as almost above
their grasp the splendour riches as riches gave no title to
preeminent attention in her presence the passport was talent
the mind was the object looked at and the duchess was
always surrounded by the first wits the age she was a
female great literary attainments and also a warm admirer
 them in other persons
tom and jerry had scarcely taken their leave the
duchess when they came uj with the splendid carriage
and retinue the marchioness diamonds jerry
had to undergo the ordeal another introduction butin
this instance he assumed greater confidence he was
not overwhelmed with beauty the marchioness wanted
that certain sort something so easy to be impressed
with yet so difficult to describe everything that art
could supply was employed to embellish and set off her
person with effect the mantuamaker had to alter her dress a
hundred times if it did not make the bust the marchioness
a perfect model for a statuary to copy from the taste the
milliner was tortured again and again to produce unrivalled
exclusive novelty for the head this great female leader 
jerry in training for a swell 
the fashion and the invention the jeweller was never
allowed to be at rest in order to give a richness to her person
which otherwise could not have been acquired in short
style was her idol to gain the name being the bestdressed
lady and to have her routs the most numerouslyattended
were the darling themes her conversation and
the limit and extent her ideas that such a one was
denominated a corinthian a dashing fellow a luck 
a blood the go a leader fashion c was itself a
sufficient recommendation to her notice she was restless
and uneasy except when engaged in some fashionable
bustle change scene to her feelings according to the
fashionable calendar such as being at bath brighton
cheltenham c in their seasons was as necessary as change
 apparel it was too great a bme to the marchioness to
inquire about the mind or talents her acquaintance but if
he were rich he was sure the entre to her parties she
had abundance sentiment attached to her character but nota
grain feeling the pathetic imaginary tale distress
highly wrought up in a novel was delightful it was exquisite
j but an account real poverty was excruciating
to her mind it was horrid quite disgusting shocking
and must not be repeated in her presence she was entirely
made up ajrt anything like unsophisticated nature
was brutish barbarous and low such was the contrast
between the above two ladies to whom poor jerry had
been introduced on turning his head hawthorn felt
quite delighted to perceive logic at no great distance
among the crowd horsemen and with a smile on his
countenance he gently touched the arm the corinthian
and observed that his friend bob was making his way to
join their party the trio was soon complete and the
comical face logic prepared them to expect some fun
 life in london
and good humour have you seen the divinity said
the oxonian to jerry whom do you mean why
the duchess hearts isn't she a delightful creature
and but for that one failing hush cried tom
well never mind jerry said bob more on that head
anon 
in going down the ride logic pointed out to jerry
the eich old evergreen no general in the aimy
however attentive to his duty said logic ever kept a
more active foraging party than did this amorous hero
notwithstanding his allowance four most splendid establishments
to different women at one period his life every
pretty face that was compatible and every female possessing
charms which could excite any emotion in his amorous breast
was presented at his mansion by his male and female procurers
old evergreen was considered as the most systematic
debauchee on the town and although he had injured the
peace mind lots most interesting girls he was never
injured in his life the extent his purse carried everything
before it he was one the deepest files in london 
indeed he was awake upon every suit on the turf or at the
table he was quite at home and more young noblemen fell
sacrifices to his schemes than to those any other person
who knew how to cut a dtjce or slip a tray to the houses
 illfame he was a contributor that defies description to
relate the manner in which maria was deceived betsy decoyed
 pamela entreated agnes persuaded charlotte iris
veiled louisa cajoled nancy tricked fanny amused 
caroline played with polly shuffled kitty cheated susan
imposed upon jane hummed sally deluded ellen seduced
lucy betrayed peggy debauched sophia duped rachel
frightened and emma coaxed would be utterly impossible 
jerry in training for a swell 
but that old evergreen fulfilled what shakspeare has
so emphatically described was never doubted to those he
op'd the chamber door
let in a maid that out a maid
never returned any more 
my dear jerry continued bob it was the pride and
boast om evergreen that the finest females this kingdom
had at various times his life either adorned his mansion or
graced his coach and from his cabinet rarities two great
personages had not only been furnished with mistresses but
also several the most conspicuous characters in the blaze 
fashion so been a sportsman was old evergreen and so well
acquainted with the manoeuvres the course that he was not
easily jockeyed but when a new object appeared in view no
one knew better how to liegeoff than he did in having no
objection that his old flies should run under other names
old evergreen had ample resources in replenishing his stud
alio is that sprightlylooking young man with a pretty
girl with him in the singlehorse chaise said jerry to
logic that gave you a nod when he passed us just now 
he is called bill dash replied the oxonian and i assure
you he is a swell the first magnitude and well breeches he
is one those characters that will have everything prime
about him he is always talking behaving like a gentleman
ie to do what is right one man to another for instance
if he makes a bet to pay it also if he says a thing
to keep his word and if he promises a handsome present to
a female it is done he is as independent as the wind he
 see the righthand side the plate where the little boy is running to
get out the way the horse
o life in london
does not care for any body fond joking but as coarse ai
a irishwoman at billingsgate propriety he laughs at and the
company modest women he absolutely ridicules the 
you see with him he has taught to spar and they frequently
have a setto together with the gloves by way 
amusement nevertheless she is a woman very superior
accomplishments yet dash notwithstanding his eccentricities
has numerous good qualities he hates canting and
hypocrisy beyond expression but he never wants to be twice
asked to relieve the really unfortunate and drops his hunt like
a generous fellow i will jerry introduce you to him the
first opportunity and you will find that in exploring the
charade bill dash your time may be employed to

logic had scarcely concluded his remarks on dash when
the honourable dick trifle in his phaeton and four rapidly
passed them bob was also known to trifle and received
the friendly nod from this firstrate hero the dandies
how strangely he is dressed exclaimed jerry in an undertone
laughing to logic why he looks as prim as a lady's
maid what a fine shape too yes said the oxonian 
you must not expect every person jerry to have such a
jolly back as you have got trifle you must know descended
from rather a different stock than you did his father was
one the completest petit mattress ever beheld and his delicate
mamaia was affectation personified it was an attorneyship
marriage on both sides the only union between the parties
was a contiguity estates to have made love to each other
would have been too much trouble and therefore they dispensed
with it but the issue this marriage was the hon

got tween sleep and wake 
but dick eclipsed his parents in being the most trifling
subject the three study to trifle was the greatest hme
in the world and he in consequence preferred an opinion
ready cut and dried for him to giving himself any trouble upon
passing events he was one the completest flatterers the
day and employed an intelligent person who read everything
for him and accordingly furnished him with a little small
talk for the companies he mixed with but he was like a
clock that was wound up for a certain number hours if
the argument lasted longer or went beyond his morning's
preparation he was directly at a standstill trifle was
prodigiously fond everything new he was like a child
with a plaything tired it in a few hours his acquaintances
were numerous but they seldom lasted longer than a few days
when he made no hesitation in giving them the cut direct
his splendid fortune gave him rather an air importance in
some peculiar respects and for bronze he was equal to anything
in the whole list fashion i he was fond knowing
something about the pedigree every new hero or heroine
that crossed his path and he employed scouts for that purpose
 for this feature trifle was distinguished in the higher
circles his dress upon all occasions partook the extremity
 fashion and however ridiculous it might be he heeded it
not so he could boast its being new indeed my dear
jerry it is too true that in this great metropolis there are
thousands the above sort apologies for men to be met
with in a day's walk fellows who do not possess one original
idea whose intellectual faculties do not extend beyond the
length their noses and who are made up imitation from
the beginning to the that chapter caricatures upon
the human race sullying the dignity a man and reducing
 life in london
his character to the degradation the vain lubberly or more
gaudy peacock
do you see that welldressed man with his hair powdered
standing very near trifle's phaeton said logic to
jerry as i perceive he has been markings you down as a
bird good plumage and who may at some future day
perhaps answer his purpose for plucking he is well known at
all the tables and always on the look out for a good customer
he however prefers pigeons he does not want for
address and his manners are also extremely insinuating his
plausibility attack is generally so well managed that strangers
are got into a string before they are aware their danger
he prides himself always in being worth a tjumsand pounds 
and likewise in never being without it this large sum
principally consists in the value his articles dress and
which tend to render his appearance more imposing and to
give effect to his deeplylaid plans he is as deliberate as a
lawyer uniting the talents a good actor his gold watch
chain and seals are the first workmanship and which he
soon contrives to give the stranger a sight a diamond
shirtpin considerable brilliancy dazzles the eyes the
spectator on his little finger he sports a diamond ring
which gives a sort action to his eloquence as he is sure to
give a flourish with it his goldheaded cane finished off ina
most attractive style he always brings into play he is a
complete master all those little arts which are so well
calculated to prepossess strangers in general that he is a man
 considerable importance and property in point finesse
he is admitted to be one the greatest adepts on the town 
and from his getting the best most his opponents he
has been long designated plausible jack he lives in good
style owing to the great success he has had in repeatedly

am quite astonished said jerry and i feel much indebted
to your kindness for the hints you have given me
tom who had been engaged for a short time with some 
his acquaintances now joined jerry and logic and observed
to hawthorn they might as well leave the park and also
invited bob to dine and spend the evening with them at
corinthian house
as our heroes were quitting the ride but owing to some
little irregularity which had taken place at the gates leading
to piccadilly the long string carriages were for a short time
prevented from proceeding they passed a dashing equipage
in which were seated a plump rosyfaced middleaged female
richly attired accompanied by three young beautiful girls 
the most attractive appearance and decorated ia the highest
style fashion logic being close to the window the
coach which was open was soon recognised as an old friend
by the gouvernante as she seemed to be who addressed him in
rather an undertone with how do you you are quite a
stranger at the same time almost staring poor jerry out 
countenance the three graces as hawthorn thought
them to be with their playful eyes also gave him such goodnatured
loojcs almost winking at him that jerry appeared
fixed to the spot as if held by some powerful magnet logic
gave a nod to the plump lady in return and as he did not
wish to attract the gaze the spectators by keeping up a conversation
he kept moving onwards to get up with the corinthian
who was about a hundred yards before them when
by way a goodbye the gouvernante smiling observed i
suppose it will not be long first mr l before you give us a
look in and perhaps you will bring your friend along with you
 life in london
the carriages were now again in rapid motion which circumstance
relieved jerry as it were from his temporary trance
what lovely girls exclaimed hawthorn i suppose that
is the mamma and her three daughters i declare i was quite
struck with their pleasant countenances you seem an old
acquaintance theirs logic said laughing outright yes
yes they are goodnatured enough if you will furnish the
means

that those three nymphs who have so much dazzled your
optics are three nuns and the plump female is mother
 great notoriety but generally designated the abbess 
her residence is at no great distance from one the
royal palaces and she is distinguished for her bold ingenuous
line conduct in the profession which she has chosen to
adopt so much so indeed that she eclipses all her competitors
in infamy honour however singular it may seem
mother lays claim to as the keystone her character
she certainly must be considered as a female singular pretensions
 and materially different from the frail sisterhood
in general mother is also very anxious to preserve
something like a reputation that when she is spoken 
amongst the gay votaries pleasure it might be said that
the devil is iiever imlf so black as he painted this desire 
reputation it ought to be observed does not originate from
the qualms conscience but arises from her peculiar sagacity

that her visitors may not be broken in upon or overhauled
by the unmannerly intrusion the officers justice accom

panted by distracted parents seeking their deluded children
it is the greatest boast motlier that she is an open
and avowed enemy to seduction also that the cries and lamentations
 ruined girls shall not echo along the walls her
mansion her maxim is that good order must be preeminent
force or squeamishness are contrary to her plan 
and the most ready compliance to her wishes by those persons
she admits into her house must never be lost sight for an
instant for the better regulation her mansion motlier
has established a code laws which without hesitation
must be agreed to before any girl can be taken
under protection she is likewise candid and sincere in her
professions and will not suffer any damsels to enter her
service under any species delusion it is the general plan
 motlier to reason with all those females who claim
protection respecting the course life they are about to
embrace she points out to them the vicissitudes they are
likely to meet with in such an uncertain career but particularly
to bear in mind that whatever disasters may ensue
it is solely attributable to themselves it must also be well
understood that in connecting themselves with her household
it is entirely from their own preference and adoption and
those girls who cannot comply with her dictates had much
better relinquish their intentions mother is completely
a woman business she also makes known to those females
who apply to her for places that those girls who conduct
themselves well will meet with every indulgence no pleasure
is denied to them besides having the pleasure and enjoyment
 an elegant carriage and livery servants to attend upon
them to au the public places resort but their characters
for honesty must bear the strictest investigation this point

in her midnight revels will soon be taught the
necessity having a long purse though modesty is not the
motto motlier yet she is a woman discernment and
polite behaviour she is not to be easy duped and before
she introduces her new inmates to the gallants she deems
it necessary to give them a few instructions to put them on
their guard against many impositions that novices are liable
to in the various walks life her particular injunctions to
her pupils are however my girls you may be amused never

squeamish in having the names their partners brought upon

rather hurt at their amusements being called in question though
many them might assert that they only went as it were to
take a peep at the curiosities in the abbey
look look said jerry whose attention was suddenly
arrested by a row on the path as the crowd were pushing
forward to get through the gate on inquiry it turned out
that some thieves dressed in the first style fashion had
attempted to pick the pockets the passengers nothing
further now transpired and in a short time our heroes
arrived safely at corinthian house

corinthian tom with all lies romantic notions was
not a don quixote in his chivalrous exploits neither
was his prougi jerry a sancho pan in his adventures
windmills were not the objects their research and attack
but the gallantry they possessed stood upon higher ground
than to suffer distressed damsels to be in want protectors
munchausen was however considered too great a traveller to
be admitted the party in their rambles and sprees through
the metropolis but yet tom's golden key operated like magic
in opening all the doors that opposed his progress and his
showers silver were so pelting and penetrating a nature
that few persons could be found who possessed courage enough
to resist the powerful effects such a storm
the rusticity jerry was fast wearing off and he was
gaining confidence every day under the auspices tom who
dio life in london
had taken some pains to make his coz somewhat aw aii upon
most the subjects that had come before him j and which
added to the assistance logic he bid fair in a short time
to become as prime an article in the gay throng as either
 the above heroes in kicking up a lark or to mill his way out
 a row to pay compliments to the swell highbred fair ones
at the west the town to chaff with the flash
colliers and in being at home to a peg in all their
various sprees and rambles jerry was an apt scholar 
and in some particular instances it was thought he had abbacy
made a tie it with both his great masters
to most tom's acquaintances he had been introduced 
but an introduction to the lovely fascinating corinthian kate
it seems was reserved as a iiigh treat for jfirry when a more
congenial opportunity offered
tom having pushed the glass about briskly after dinner
proposed a visit to the theatres jerry was all alive in an
instant at the sound but the fine old wines the corinthian
had made him a little bit on the go and tom was also in
high spirits logic who was a great lover the bottle was
too bosky as he termed it to accompany them to the fields 
temptation the oxonian had been quite full oxford all the
evening and drinking bumpertoasts to all his friends the
good fellows at that university but more especially to all
the unfortunates at the castle st thomas logic had been
explaining to jerry the nature pupil's straits that at
present jerry was also out dad's will the states 
independence were likewise before him but above all to keep
 a slang term made use by thieves and policeofficers for low
prostitutes

a good lookout after the waste beady logic's comical
mug was here so twisted with the hiccough that he could
scarcely articulate jerry my boy you have gained a little
knowledge respecting the province bacchus and you are
now hiccoughing under the dynasty venus the
corinthian observed to his coz that as the fustian 
was getting fast hold logic they would be off without
him
upon their arrival at drury lane theatre the performances
did not operate on their feelings as a source attraction it
is true they took a glimpse at the play but as they did not go
for anything like criticism on the abilities the actors or to
descant upon the merits the pieces it was merely a glimpse
indeed our heroes went upon another errand their eyes
were directed to different parts the house and tom not
meeting with any his acquaintances at old drury ashe
had anticipated they immediately pushed off to take a
peep at covent garden theatre a hole at the stage was
quite sufficient for their purpose and without any more
delay the corinthian and jerry soon bustled into the
saloon
tom and his coz had scarcely reached the place for refreshments
when the bug began and they were surrounded
by numbers the gay cyprians who nightly visit this place
some these delicate heroines which the plate represents
soon began to jeer the corinthian on the cause his absence
 sleepy when a person cannot keep his eyes open it is said he has
met with the fustian
notwithstanding the last two erections this theatre the phrase is
so familiar with almost every person acquainted with theatricals that it
is a question whether it will ever lose the title old derby
 life in l london
while others these ladyurns were offering their congratulations
to him on his restoration to society jerry being in
company with so distinguished a hero as tom was itself a
sufficient source attraction to these fancy pieces who have
an eye to business to pay their court to hawthorn and
accordingly their cards were presented to jerry in order to
grace their lists with the addition a new and rich friend's
these cards rather puzzled jerry who appeared astonished
that such dashing females should keep sjios upon hawthorn
giving a hint on this circumstance to tom the latter
immediately put an extinguisher on the conversation with
hush
the scene altogether made a strong impression on the
lively senses poor jerry and more animatedly perhaps
than if he had not been flushed with wine before he entered
the saloon he not only asked a variety questions concerning
those girls that took his attention either on account
 their beauty fine figure or dress but also respecting
many the male promenaders who appeared to him quite at
home as to a knowledge and intimate acquaintance with
most these unfortunate females
my dear coz whispered the corinthian it would bea
most interesting as well as an extensive work to detail
anything like the histories the ladies that visit here
accompanied also with the memoirs their gallants but
take notice any characters that may appear prominent to
you here and at some future period if it is in my power and
you remind me the circumstance i will give you all the
necessary information you require
an universal praise with the girls the town for their keepers
a spree taking blue ruin 
who is that fashionablydressed gentleman that seems
almost hoisted into the form an s said jerry he
was once a distinguished leader fashion replied tom but
he is on the shelf now i think so indeed echoed jerry
inform has anything to do with it
jerry who had just entered into a little chitchat with
fair fanny suddenly recognised a tall thin gentleman
with powdered hair and about thirty years age that passed
him as a person he had seen several times at bath do
you know him said fanny with all his demure looks
he is a precious hypocrite and expends thousands ayear upon
the women but he will have nothing to say to us girls 
the town he is only fond the slaveys laughing heartily
i imposed myself upon him once as a slavey i it is true sir
i assure you that he keeps a man and his wife in london to
whom he allows ayear for the sole purpose collecting
slaveys for him and they are accordingly sent down once or
twice a week as it may happen to a receivinghouse he has
for that purpose kept by an old woman in bath but it is
all done upon the sly and the greatest secrecy is preserved
throughout all the transaction indeed i could not learn his
name nor his residence in that city it is so well managed
the slaveys are all well paid besides their expenses up and
down to bath he however does not make choice one
out six that is sent to him and he never will on any
account whatever see a girl twice but modest slaveys are
so scarce an article said fanny laughing outright you
know sir in the metropolis that his procurers in london
are obliged to queer him and they are compelled to resort to
 a slang term for servant maids being servants all work and also
iu allusion to their laborious employment and hard work
 life in london
some the new girls the town and to put them up to the
secret before they leave london to behave themselves modestly
upon the occasion the sums money that he gets rid in
this way are immense jerry appeared so much astonished
at the recital the above circumstances that he could scarcely
give credit to his own ears 
can such things be 
and overcome us like a summer's cloud
without our special wonder 
the strange tales which jerry had heard and the extraordinary
characters that he had been made acquainted within
the course the last few days made him exclaim this
indeed is life m london 
in the recess allotted for refreshments the plate discovers
a rich old debauchee with his finger up in a sort hush 
manner inquiring after brilliant fanny the fruitwoman
 is off like shot to search the theatre for the ladybird
in question to inform the brilliant that her friend 
has been inquiring for her fanny decked out with an ele
 several the girls are here known by what are termed nicknames 
according to circumstances or after their persons such as brilliant
faint the friend faint was a gentleman who hated the trouble
 having money about him indeed he was so extravagant a disposition
that he always lived in credit i ie he received his money quarterly
from a large jewellers firm and his creditors to an accredited
amount were paid one quarter under the other fanny never received
from her friend any cash for her favours but plenty jewellery her
person was always elegantly decorated with valuable necklaces earrings
c which gained her the appellation the brilliant 
these persons are the most accommodating description about the
theatre they will fetch and carry like a spaniel answer any questions
about the girls c provided the tip is forthcoming

fashionably dressed in blue arm in arm with an antique
remnant fashion one the lord oglehy tribe and who has
been repeatedly quizzed by the brilliant as being neither
ornamental nor useful but the antique asserts if he stays
at home a single night he is devoured with ennui and that
by way apology for his appearance in the saloon he
merely looks in to see an old acquaintance or if anything
new appears among the stock frailties the fair
maria dressed in a blue ridinghabit seated on a chair in a
corner near the recess and the pretty ellen standing
behind her are throwing out lures in order to attract the
notice the corinthian and jerry the old guy on
the top the stairs with his spectacles on fast sinking into
the lean and slippered pantaloon is gently tapping in an
amorous way the white soft arm lusty hackeyed jane 
and inviting her to partake a glass wine to which she
consents in the most businesslike manner indeed blackeyed
jane has often publicly remarked that it is immaterial
to her whether it is a duke or his groom so that she receives
her compliments several recesses may also be recognised

may try to push them oflf as king richard observes

they are not idlest as to the purposes for which those unfortunate
girls are sent into the saloon the artist has been uncommonly
happy in his delineation the above characters
who made their appearance when the sketch was made
jerry did not feel any inclination to quit the saloon from
the great attraction and novelty which it had afforded him
he therefore kept promenading up and down indiscriminately
chattering with one or other the girls till the usual mode
was adopted putting out the lights as the only effectual
method getting rid such company who never stand to any
consideration about projmehj or time the corinthian suggested
to his coz that as the spell was broken up and he
 the proprietors houses illfame
several persons near the theatres get their livelihood by letting out
dresses to these unfortunate women at a certain price for the evening 
but notwithstanding all their eyes argus they are sometimes duped
by the girls running off with the clothes o
 others board and lodge the girls in their houses who are generally
kept as dirty as sweeps all the day but decked out at night like duchesses
it is also no uncommon thing for many these unhappy girls who are
not in luck as it is termed or nitre properly and intelligibly speaking
if they do not bring home money the wages their prostitution to be
sent to bed supperless and frequently beaten into the bargain their
mistresses likewise search them immediately after their gallants have left

the corinthian and jerry who had got rather a little
funny by this time from the lots wine and line ruin they
had drank ia the course the evening were recommended by
fat bet to take a cup coffee as it was getting late which
would put them all to rights our heroes on leaving the
sluice were not long before they strolled into a coffeeshop
this group which the plate so correctly delineates and in
point character equal to any hogarth's celebrated productions
displays a complete picture what is termed low

carelessness being its prominent features it is however
quite new to thousands in london tom and jerry have just

 to describe this sensation in the instance alluded to is totally
impossible but however degrading and repugnant it may appear to the
feelings human nature it is too true that there are to be found in the
metropolis thousands men who exist entirely on the prostitution 
women females who daily and nightly walk the streets london for
the sole purpose getting a livelihood and to support such a set 
wretches but the most extraordinary circumstances attached to these
disgusting fellows are so finely described by the poet
all are not men that bear the human form 
that these unfortunate women suffer themselves to be beaten by them 
and also carry their fondness to such an excess for those petticoat
pensioners that if they catch them with any other girls their jealousy

has been given to shove the poor fluemaker against tom's light
drab coat the corinthian being no novice in these matters
floored two or three the musty coves in a twinkling the
row then became general the glims were all darkened and the
whole the party were soon out in the street to settle their

turned upon those midnight birds watch watch was
vociferously called the rattles were au in motion and lots
 charleys came toddling up to the spot the corinthian
ultimately was overpowered by numbers and lugged off to the
watchhouse
our heroes were soon in trouble after this spree and the
plate is an exact sketch a watchhouse scene at midnight

to rescue him from the rude grasp the guardians night 
and as he was now getting a little flash he trippedup two 
the charleys as he said without charging them a halfpenny
for it but as he could not fight a mob he was obliged to
give way to numbers and also suffer himself to be dragged
into the watchhouse all tom's eloquence was no avail

were such strong evidence against tke muscular powers our
heroes that old snoozy observed he could only befriend the
gentleman so far as to admit them to bail but the charge
against them must be entered in the and be disposed 
the next morning before the magistrates at bow street bail
was accordingly procured and our heroes in a rattler arrived
at an early hour at corinthian house once more in safety
but rather in a sleepy wornout condition
by the time that tom and jerry had taken their breakfast
and dressed themselves the dial pointed out to them it was
near one o'clock the hour appointed for their appearance at
bow street upon the arrival our heroes at this public
office several nightcharges besides matters felony were
waiting for the decision the magistrates in consequence 
which the corinthian and jerry seated themselves till it
came to their turn to be heard hawthorn was so much
taken up with the novelty the circumstances before him
that it nearly escaped his memory that he attended at bow
street on purpose to answer for his breaking the peace
during their stay the following interesting scene took
place an elegant but unfortunate young female it seems
whom poverty had reduced to its lowest ebb had in a fit 
desperation almost as her last resource called a hackney
coach and drove to a house in a respectable street near
grosvenor square to solicit relief a friend who had known
her when virtue and prosperity shone upon her but alas 
the door was shut against her and she was ordered to depart
without delay this shock was almost too much for her
already agitated frame but the reef a feiv tears enabled
her to order the coachman to proceed to an elegant mansion
in portland place it was the residence her seducer the
 life in london
origin all ler misfortunes it was also the dwelling her
keeper who when satiated with her lovely person had
abandoned her to the wide world to him she now applied
for a few pounds in order to escape the horrible life a
street walker and like a humble penitent to return to her
home and to sue for forgiveness even at the feet her agonised
and distracted relatives upon her sending a message to see
this gentleman the answer returned to this unfortunate creature
produced so violent a fit hysterics that the coachman could
scarcely restore her to her senses it was that if she did not
instantly quit the place an officer justice would he sent for and
herself given into custody she then drove to one or two
other houses with no better success on her arrival at lincoln's
inn fields in a state frenzy she wished to quit
the coach but only gave the coachman three shillings some
little altercation ensued as the long time the coachman
had been employed made his fare amount to a heavy charge
jarvey finding no means settling the dispute took the
summary mode driving this unfortunate girl to bow
street office and represented his complaint to the magistrate
the latter person informed her that if she did not pay
the coachman he must be under the painful necessity 
committing her to prison her elegance deportment 
her manners so truly interesting and her tale the
injuries and misfortunes she had sustained was so artlessly
told that not a dry eye was to be seen in the office ina
tone that penetrated every heart she represented to the
magistrate that she loss now quite indifferent as to chat
might become lier can you take any less coachman
said the magistrate no sir i am but a poor
sarvant with a wife and family to support and my master
is a very hard man who will make me account and pay
for my time or else i would not say anything about
a spree taking blue ruin 
it for myself after a short pause and in great agitation
 body and mind she took out her pocketbook two
shillings and putting them down on the table scarcely
able to give utterance that it was all the money
she possessed in the world she was sorry for the
coachman he was not to blame indeed he had been
more kind to her than otherwise she had never cheated
any person in her life and it was the first time she had ever
appeared before a magistrate her tears now prevented her
from proceeding jarvis took up the two shillings by the
order the magistrate but instantly throwing one them
out his hand the tear starting from his eye exclaimed
with as fine pathos as mrs siddons in the best her performances
 but it was nature that spoke it sltxiu never he said
that bill tool the last shilling from a woman in distress
no no i manage it somehow with my master and my girl if
you will hut tell me where you live i will also drive you home if you
live as far off as barnet i have no residence i am without
a home i sold all my clothes yesterday to discharge my
lodgings i have not a friend in the world sobbing
violently the magistrate was overcome and justice was
never seen to greater advantage the scene was affectingly impressive
the hand the magistrate as if involuntarily produced
the purse out his pocket in an instant but his tongue
could scarcely articulate no my good fellow you shall
not lose your expenses there they are for you
putting down the rncmy your generous and manly conduct
deserves more than your fare to the unfortunate
female who had nearly fainted away he observed my
poor girl i am sorry for your situation there is a threeshilling
piece for you let me entreat you to return to the
path virtue repent what is past j and you may yet become
by your future conduct a useful and a good member 
 life in london
society this admonition although delivered in the most
expressive manner had not a single harsh accent reproof
connected with it the generous conduct which this unfortunate
girl had experienced both from the magistrate and the
coachman seemed to have fixed her to the spot but when she
recovered the possession herself the superior manners she
displayed in returning thanks to the worthy magistrate and
honest jarvy and the way in which she took her leave the
office touched every one present indeed it was a fine scene
altogether it was one nature's richest moments description
either from the pencil or the pen must fall short in
communicating it my uncle toby would have hobbled on
crutches one hundred miles to have witnessed it and corporal
tim would never have related the circumstance without hungering
over it for an hour sterne would have made a complete
chapter it the dead ass at rampant the friar 
and maria moulines were not finer pictures the human
heart either in richness colouring grandness design or
softness touch than the eloquence nature displayed in
the unfortunate cyprian's case at bow street jerry at the
request tom endeavoured to overtake the coach in order
to ascertain its number but the idea struck tom too late to
give hawthorn an opportunity coming up with the vehicle
upon jerry's resuming he observed the coachman was out
 sight this was a great disappointment to corinthian
tom and he exclaimed i am very sorry for that j but i trust
my dear friend that so generous and feeling a fellow will
never be out sight the liberal and goodhearted 
mankind 
the plate is an accurate representation the public office
bow street and the portrait pf coach is a fine specimen 
the talents the artist in his personification character
a spree taking bl ue r uln 
the countenances the prisoners as standing in the felon's
box with irons on their legs are also depicted with great felicity
 expression
the corinthian and jerry were now called upon to
defend themselves against the charge made hy barney ff bother
the watchman who may be recognised in the plate standing
near the unfortunate cyprian dressed quite theatrically for
the part he was about to play barney's head was tied up
with a handkerchief in his right hand he held a broken
lantern a sort stage property that had been brought forward
on many similar occasions and in his left a damaged rattle
also an old performer at bow street a threadbare coat
torn in sits likewise ready for any emergency completed the
denouement arne told a prime tough story to the magistrate
laying it on rare and thick against the corinthian and
as to the countrylooking gentleman barney observed that
he had not only spoilt the look his face but had nearly
knocked out one his eyes that he was as strong as a lion
as he had hate down with as much case as if he had been
mowing grass pat sullivan tim by an roger m oar thy and
dennis bryan whom he had called in to assist him in keeping
the pace and plase your honour when i talked to the
gentleman about it he said he would not cmrge them a halfpenny
for it my coat your worship has also been torn into paces
 nine times out ten the watchmen get the best the nightcharges
they are frequently in the right there is no doubt but as they
always have a broken lantern by them with the other little et ceteras
ready cut and dried to produce it necessary in order to give a kind 
emphasis and character to their statements besides having the pul in
their favour in opening the charge and colouring it as they think proper
little hopes can be entertained any one who unfortunately may be
engaged in a nightrow getting through the piece before a magistrate
 life in london
and my rattle and lantern broke into the bargain the
corinthian endeavoured to refute the charge made by barney
by stating that the principal part it was a made up one
the magistrate observed that he had no alternative but to
order the expenses the watchman to be paid for the damage
he had received as the latter had sworn to it he therefore
advised them to retire and make it up tom and jerry
took the hint made their bows to the justice settled the
difference with the charley and soon returned to corinthian
house where logic had been waiting their return for a short
time in order to have a bit fun with them on their night's
spree
chapter x
tom and jerry at a masquerade supper at the opera house

mr jackson's rooms tom logic and jerry call
upon the champion england to view his parlour
and the silver cup a turn into the westminster pit
to sport their blunt on the phenomenon monkey finishing
the evening and getting the best a charley
jerry frequently had a hearty laugh at the coffeeshop
row whenever it came across his mind indeed the
incidents the night were too comic a description easily
to escape from his memory but in repeating the unfortunate
cyprian's case at bow street to his acquaintances in which
jerry took great delight he was considerably affected
often would jerry break out in raptures that coach was
a trump indeed i and tom equally animated exclaimed
there was a fine heart under a rough garment and if i
did but know where to find the generous fellow i would
make him a present as good a coach and horses as could be
purchased
worth makes the man and want it the fellow
the rest is all but leather or prunella
logic was so often at the elbow hawthorn that the
latter was rapidly getting aivake to the tricks and fancies 
 life in london
london and could appear at almost any place without
showing symptoms the johnny eaw tom therefore
proposed as a diversity scene that jerry should go with
him to the masquerade at the opera house the only
difficulty which existed on the subject was what character
jerry could personify to the most advantage and with ease
to himself logic with a grin on his face suggested that
jerry would be quite at home if he went as a huntsman
it was a sure place to turnup plenty game and with his
whip in his hand he would have an opportunity lashing all
the folly that might surround him the view halloo 
which he was so complete a master now and then introduced
would give such a finish to his character that he might hunt
the place with all the confidence an old masquerader
bravo cried tom i like the idea what do you say toit
jerry under your direction my dear coz replied
hawthorn i cannot fail give me but a few hints before
we start and i will do my best to play my part to your
satisfaction it shall be so and what character do you
intend to personify logic said the corinthian the
oxonian thought that he should merely parade the room in a
domino for the first half hour and if he then felt himself ina
humour to have a bit fun he would attempt to assume
a character dresses were procured without delay when tom
soon became attired as the gay libertine xoft giovanni jerry
was metamorphosed into the sunisjnan and comical bob
obscured ti a black domino all being ready this prime
trio started off full spirits determined to have a complete
night it at the masquerade logic had made up his mind
to quiz and teaze both his friends and his intention in going
in a domino was that he could slip out unobserved change
his dress and return in a character in the assumption which
he might be less liable to meet with detection from the

a masquerade supper 
corinthian and jerry logic felt quite pleased at the fun
which he had pictured to himself he should experience in
crossing his two friends while their minds were entirely
engaged in the surrounding scene and perhaps thrown off
their guard and also in being frequently at their elbows
when they thought that he was placidly pacing up and down
the rooms as a silent spectator in an insignificant domino
jerry had received his cue from the corinthian and he
also picked up a few loose hints from logic as they rode in
the carriage through the streets bob screwed up his comical
face assuming a sort gravity and assured hawthorn that
a masquerade represented one those luxurious moments when
scarcely anything but the passions prevail it is also a fine
picture life in the metropolis it has its attractions and
its drawbacks for my own part said logic i have been
delighted beyond measure at the extraordinary talents that i
have met with at this species amusement as well as having
been disgusted with witnessing impudence substituted for
ability but nevertheless the contrast is not only entertaining
but profitable as it affords degrees comparison towards
acquiring a more intimate acquaintance with the various
classes society a masquerade at all events gives an opportunity
for the exhibition talents the searchers after fun
may either find it or create it the man wit may sjww it
the punster be quite at home the satirist have full
scope for his powers ridicule the dancer may sport a
foe with effect and applause and the lovers music enjoy a
treat the singer can amuse the company and be amused in
return the serious hero can scarcely be serious at a masquerade
but then he may keep his laugh to himself under his
mask and however strange it may appear yet such is the
fact that the fastidious person may still remain fastidums in
 ltfe in london
the motley group by which he is surrounded under the protection

throws her lait to inveigle the gallants msii with wine

to make a better bargain for her favours the man the world
repairs to a masquerade in search adventures the modest
folks but yet curious ones who may have felt a lavish just to
have it to say in company they have been at a masquerade
once in their lives yet perhaps have reason to repent it as long
as they exist the genteel thief in order to rob the unwary under
the appearance a person rank and whose assumption 
consequence if detected in the act is almost enough to appal an
old trap under the fear that he has laid hold the wrong
person the deckedout procuress parading up and down to
keep a sharp lookout after her young brood that none them
might fly off with her finery which she has lent out at above 
per cent profit to embellish their unhappy frames the dissipated
 all ranks drop in here by way an excuse to try to get
rid their ennui for half an hour in search novelty and
the windup the critic is that a masquerade in england 
is one the dullest species amusement and that though
the room is full characters in point fact it really possesses
no character at all for merit and talent nay he terms
it shocking and quite a bore
a view hallo for the critic interrupted jeery so say
i rejoined logic and you may travel from dan to beersheba
and cry all is barren but i am not one that des
 notwithstanding the great vivacity the french people the masquerades
in england have been considered with all their defects by most
travellers to be in point spirit and characters much superior to such
amusements in france punch and punchinello being by far the most
numerous personages at a french masquerade
a masquerade supper 
bcription i am for life and a curricle and as it is the opinion
 a noble law lords given without a fee a man the most
distinguished talents and eloquence ilmt a little mirth in
this melancholy life is a good thing i mean to act upon it
the unmasking at the suppertable my dear boy you will enjoy
as it is often a great source laughter and surprise when
it discovers the faces numerous acquaintances who have
been playing off their wit and raillery against each other all
the evening under their various disguises a masquerade
is an unsorted class society i readily admit but are you not
liable to mix with bad persons in the bestregulated companies
even robberies have been frequently committed in churches and
if you keep aloof from mankind on that account you may soon
become a crying philosopher afraid to stir from your own fireside
in order to prevent contamination and be devoured by
hypochondriacal the remainder your days it principally
depends in my humble opinion on the strength mind possessed
by the persons themselves here logic was interrupted
by their arrival at the opera house well done cries
the corinthian most impartially argued bob now for
it jerry remember that
all the world s a stage
and all the men and women belt players 
they have their exits and their entrances
and one man in his time plays many parts 
enough replied hawthorn i shall do my best
it was about twelve o'clock when our trio entered
the masquerade they were in a right humour for fun
j erskine this opinion is certainly a good one either in point law
or fact
 life in london
and the scene before them having taken a glass or two 
tom's rich old wines the vivifying qualities which would
almost make the dumb to clatter the stage exhibited a
most extensive motley group the illuminations were
not only splendid but profuse in all parts the house
the bands music all in full sound and the gallery opened
for the admission spectators displayed a most brilliant assemblage
 company indeed it was an imposing scene
altogether however familiar the eye might be with amusements
 this kind the activity life fun frolic gaiety
mirth and good humour which presented itself gave it that
peculiar sort interest which renders description imperfect to
a person who never witnessed the variety incidents that
occur at a masquerade country dances were well executed
by some the characters others portraying their knowledge
 attitudes in the elegant but lascivious waltz quadrilles were
performed with great taste heavyheeled harlequins in
abundance and plenty clowns not possessing sense enough
to play the fool sailors ignorant the difference between

and as she sidled by

yet not possessing courage enough to attempt a
character country bumpkins who never lost sight lunnun
with a goclcmy dialect counsellors with wigs and gowns
but no lawyers doctors full prescriptions in search 
patients without troubling themselves about a knowledge 
the false abbesses without nunneries and nuns who
despised the veil altogether yet here and there this
insipidity was relieved by a sprinkling talent a lively repartee
 a tonne louche a character almost without a fault
elegantly attired females witty and interesting singing three
or four lines some wellknown airs with such delightful
melody as to leave a regret that the ear could catch no more
 them and comical fellows exerting themselves to promote
mirth continually passing and repassing each other to render
this diversified assemblage with all its defects nevertheless
prominent and attractive
such a lively scene could not but operate upon the mind 
jerry although he had been in a great degree prepared for
it by tom and logic and he seemed so dazzled for the instant
that he was in the act drawing backwards as if afraid to
proceed when logic whispered into his ear to go it 
jerry soon started from his surprise and gave the mewjiajloo
so loud and fine as to attract the attention most the
company towards him and then dashing into the thickest 
the group with so much life and spirit as if determined to
 life in london
keep up the delusion with all the animation a real foxchase
with a fine country before him and the dogs and horsemen at
his heels
from the flattering reception jerry met with in traversing
these regions frolic and fun he soon overcame his fears 
and the corinthian felt quite pleased that his prougi had
acquitted himself with so much talent indeed from the
vivacity he exhibited jerry appeared more like an old
stager in these revels than the inexperienced fearful descant
in fact hawthorn was so much alive to the scene before him
that he hallooed sung and slashed along with his whip till
he was almost exhausted and compelled to sit down tom
as his sonship had been also actively engaged in distributing
a thousand elegant compliments to the lovely fair ones and
logic under the domino had been going it upon a few 
his friends with much humour the time tom and jerry
had been so pleasingly occupied that neither them had
bestowed one thought about logic the oxonian taking
advantage this circumstance had slipped out to the wardrobe
and changed his black dress for a pink one he now
approached jerry and altering the tone his voice observed
mr huntsman you seem to have been upon a good scent 
have had rare sport and met with finer game here than ever
you turned up in the neighbourhood hawthorn hall 
who the deuce is that cries hawthorn that knows me
here but logic had dashed into the midst the crowd 
masks and was lost sight before jerry recovered from his
surprise the oxonian soon afterwards came across tom who
was surrounded by a host ladies listening to the forgiving
song which the corinthian had nearly concluded 
go not yet for now s the time
the boys are all bangup and prime
a masquerade supper 
full purik ripe for a lark 
damn the expense exclaims each spark
in spirits every one
my dears you know you need not hush
nor be afraid or cry out husk j 
then grant the favour that i ask
no one knows you under your mask
then stay oh be gay
away with coyness and parade
tis all fair at a masquerade
or wherefore do we come 
the hours fly the poet sings
and scandal here has got no wings 
for here we meet upon the sly
and all too game to cry oriel 
a truce to love's alarms
good characters here consist in dress
your lovely charms then let me press 
your honour s safe my life my heart
then be not ciduel e'er we part
oh be gay then stay
away with coyness and parade
tis all fair at a masquerade
or wherefore do we come
logic stopped tom's career all a sudden with mighty don
if you are so very liberal to those ladies you will not have
left the hundredth part a compliment for pool corinthian
kate who is now closely besieged by the grand turk
on yonder seat logic could scarcely articulate the words
for laughter when he was off again like a shot tom blushed
under his mask and felt rather mortified for the neglect he
had shown to kate and instantly went in pursuit her
logic who well knew tom's feelings on this tender subject
thought this would be the case and stationed himself near
the turk to witness his manoeuvres and to enjoy the hoax he
had practised on his friend the corinthian approached the
 life in london
lady under the protection the turk and rather in an
agitated soft tone said my dear kate kate kate 
my love but receiving no answer he was about to take
hold her hand when logic started forwards and assuming
a solemn tone voice articulated each man beware you
know not what you do have you no regard for your life 
you are sure to be strangled if the grand turn perceives your
attack upon this favourite lady his harem and to whom
he has just thrown the handkerchief a fig for his bowstring
scimitar poisonbowl guards and all said tom
then turning towards the lady with a touch the pathos
exclaimed 
there is more peril in thine eyes kate
that twenty their swords 
logic could not contain himself any longer at this piece 
fun which he had made but bursting out into a hearty
laugh and making use an old pun told tom that he
was missitalcen it was all a jioax and asked him if he
did not know his old pal bob logic confound you
replied the corinthian you had nearly brought me
into a troublesome scrape and made me feel for the moment
rather uncomfortable but no matter now as you have
explained it where's jerry our heroes immediately
went in search hawthorn whom they found animatedly
pressing the hand a nun and soliciting with great
ardour a sight her face her name c praising her shape
and make and saying how much he admired her logic
and tom did not interrupt the utebate but kept aloof waiting
to see the denouement the lady it seems having caught
sight jerry's countenance unknown to him at an early
part the evening while he was taking some refreshment
recognised him as the prougi the corinthian and with
much naivete asked jerry if he followed all his sporting
a masquerade supper 
pursuits withso much ardour you certainly sir said the
lady laughing appear to he an apt scholar and have done
credit to the instructions your master and as hunting seems
to he joit forte i flatter myself i can afford you the pleasures
 a long chase but you must not hold me any longer as i
really must endeavour to join my company my dear
lady in a most impassioned manner replied hawthoen still
pressing her hand let me not be at fault let me obtain the
right scent favour me with your card and upon my
hold mr tally no professions the only cte you will
obtain from me is no no you shall have no clue at all
from me what am i about a complete stranger and to
o dear sir how can you make such an improper request
 but jerry was too much a sportsman to quit the
field at least without marking down his bird and therefore
pressed his request with redoubled ardour well then
said the lady since you are determined not to receive any
denial and will not let me go without an answer take the first
letter from the solution each the following sentences
and you will not need any further information jerry was
all attention to derive the secret his inquiries
what men love 
what very few ladies can do without 
what they like dangling after their trains 
what they cannot resist 
what they never like to be called 
and what the ladies are always in search 
cruel fair one to impose on me a task only fit for a conjurer
to resolve exclaimed jerry and thus to tantahse and
perplex me but surely you will not leave me thus in the
dark to ofle mi tally cruel indeed have i
not smiling been very explicit and liberal in my information
towards you well then one word more if you should
z life in london
obtain the due you will also derive a term from which every
lady wishes to escape
then hunt it out i will you greet
kindly welcome when next we meet
 goodbye goodbye jekky felt so surprised at this unexpected
adventure that he stood like one in a trance contemplating
the wit and talents displayed by his incognita while the
lady with a graceful nod skipped off and in all probability
he might have remained in his reverie for some minutes if the
laughter and two hearty slaps on the shoulder from tom and
logic had not brought him to his recollection what 
cries tom fault my dear coz and the garth in view
to her to her my boy said logic i am completely
throughout replied jerry and if you logic and the
corinthian do not lend me your assistance to expound a
riddle the lady has left me i shall never be able to run her
down let us hear this riddle said tom logic is a good
hand at making out conundrums jerry then repeated to
them the sentences from the answers to which he was to take
the first letter it is more ike an acrostic than a riddle
exclaimed the oxonian and i have no doubt we three
loggerheads can make it out but i think i know the lady
who is she asked jerry with great earnestness do
not be in such a hurry replied logic it requires some
little caution before i mention the name any female i maybe
very wrong to judge from the mere shape a lady in disguise
 but the voice seemed familiar to me as i caught the
last sound goodbye here the conversation was interrupted
by one the characters as a balladsinger amusing a
group masquers with the following comic song 
to the masquerade we go
to meet with fun and gig 
a masquerade supper

i saw sir richard wanton here said logic aud i
have no doubt the old flat has come to the masquerade to
please and humour his wife whom he is coaxingly fond 
there is a great disparity years between them it is almost
january and may but the immense fortune sir richard
i am well assured was the only attraction that obtained the
hand the lady backed by her parents as being a most
excellent match as to love on her part pshaw but the old
boy can refuse her nothing and upon several occasions she
has made him look perfectly ridiculous if she has done
nothing more than that said tom it is no consequence
only ridiculous bob is a mere bagatelle but jerry how
did you get into chat with her the nun replied hawthorn
 had lost her party and i caught her on the wing
and promised to assist her to find them but there was
something so witty and interesting belonging to her that
instead angrily telling her
to go to a nunnery go 
that heaven had made her one face
and that she had made it another
ko no i am not so much out temper with the fair sex 
but i strove gently to detain and amuse her and as she did
 when the countess a lady eminently distinguished for
the propriety her conduct and the mother a once beautiful duchess
complained to the duke respecting her daughter's wearing
such outoftheway high feathers that it was perfectly ridiculous the
laugh and tale the whole town and as her daughter's husband she
begged him to remonstrate with her on the folly and levity her
behaviour the duke with a goodnatured smile on his face replied i
thank your ladyship for the anxiety you have expressed on my account
and also for your feelings as a parent but if her grace does not put anything
upon my head to make it uncomfortable i cannot refuse her the
liberty to decorate her own as she pleases
 life in london
not seem very anxious to rejoin her party i endeavoured to
make the most my time by pressing her for a meeting at
some future period in case her friends should come upon us
suddenly and i might in consequence be separated from her
without obtaining the desired information very gallant
indeed said logic and perhaps if you had personified don
quixote here it would have been a more appropriate character
for you but do you recollect anything particular about the
dress or the person the nun yes yes i do she is
very prominent about jerry whispering into the ear
 the oxonian that s enough i am off observed logic 
and i will ascertain if possible if i am right in my conjectures
 success attend you said jerry taking hold the
arm tom and once more joining the motley group their
progress was soon arrested by the sounds the favourite air
from guy wandering as they anticipated slumber my
darling however on going into the crowd they were not
only surprised but amused with the following parody on that
delightful piece music by a female character habited a la
puissance and who disdaining any imitations those celebrated
singers that have distinguished themselves in the
execution this delightful ballad chaunted it in all the
richness slang that characterises the neighbourhoods 
nightingale lane and tothill fields
o slumber my kidwy thy dad is a scampi
thy mother s a hunters brush'd off on the tramp 
she s sold all her sprats and left nothing for thee
and got lusty with dafi and out on a spree 
then rest thee kid rest thee kid snooze while you can

the trio was once more formed by the return logic
it is all up said he to jerey i have lost all traces the
fair nun but a truce to grieving you are a good sportsman
and will soon turn up more game laughing come
come replied hawthorn no more your fun i am sure
you have accomplished your errand therefore keep me no
longer in suspense well well answered the oxonian
i think i have but first we will retire to a seat in yonder
corner and over a cup coffee let us all cudgel our brains
to expound this riddle as you call it to see whether the
application the letters bears any analogy to the name the
lady i have in view both tom and jerry immediately
acquiesced with this proposition logic who was rather
clever in giving explanations to matters this kind and with
some little assistance from tom after a short period pronounced
it most certainly to be as follows that

what all men love is w
what few women can do without is a
what they like dangling after their trains is n
what they cannot resist is t
what they never like to be called is
and what the ladies are always in search is n
and what female who possesses anything like a character
that does not wish to escape being termed a wanton
excellently well made out said tom you have not
logic thrown away all your time at the university i must
confess jerry rubbed his hands with glee and joined in
the praises the corinthian that logic was a clever fellow
the trio after some little consultation on the subject decided
that the fair nun from the questions she had given to
jerry answered the description and could be no other
person than the lively lady wanton
on the supper being announced the rooms were thrown
open for the reception the company but the rush both
male and female characters was so great to obtain good seats
that it should almost seem three parts them had been
without food for a wceki from the very eager and hungry
 attack they commenced upon the dishes which were
placed before them tom as may be witnessed in the plate
displayed the utmost gallantry in his attention to the ladies 
 the vulgar phrase i'll have my which if it makes me sick i is inmost
 the above instances completely verified the emptying plates
the cutting and coming again tossing off the wine like water 
demolishing the tarts and swallowing the jellies not only exhibits
such a taste for gluttony but evinces that most the supper folks are
determined not to pay halfaguinea for nothing yet to the lovers 
life and observation the witnessing such scene where so many
mouths are all actively employed and the remarks which also occur on
such an occasion is worth halfaguinea at any time without partaking 
the slightest refreshment

and jerky perceiving that some the company were disposed
to have a little fun was determined not to be a jot
behindhand with any the most lively heroes connected with
the motley group a strong clown began the lath after the
manner a comic hit in a pantomime by jumping on the
table and nearly upsetting one the glass chandeliers then
sticking a knife into a fowl which a counsellor was cutting up
bore it off in triumph and asked the lawyer if he had not
cut his client when a punster thought he had said one 
his best things by observing that it was most certainly foul
play another hero the same class wouldbe wits urged
it was however completely in point as counsellors were generally
concerned in most cases robbery and jerry to give
a climax to the thing in question laughingly told tom that
in suiting the action to the word by flogging the clown off
the table if he had not used mr merryman according to his
deserts it could not be said that he had escaped a whipping 
hem shakspeare the knight the woeful countenance

the coalheaver and the fireman does not seem very scrupulous
about taking her drops and is also laughing to herself at
the row which is likely to take place between her elegant
admirers both whom have been labouring to say something
handsome to her respecting her charms the coalheaver
rather angry at the supposed advantage his opponent has got
 without attempting anything like a pun upon this theatrical phrase
performers in general are so fond comic bits as to admit they are
food to them ask joey munden emery matthews litton harley c
or any the heroes belonging to the musacutting company 
there are many unfortunate cripples in this walk pun so very lame
and distorted upon every subject that instead creating a laugh they
mostly claim our pity if not excite our disgust

is pulling the fireman's long snout while the latter as he
termed it in consequence the rudeness such a fellow
threatens to spoil his fingers with his chiv the flinty
mordecai who would sooner lose his life than lois properties
on most occasions but amorously inclined in the present
instance is giving way to his feelings and don't care a single
farthing about his monish so he can but gain his object 
but nevertheless he cannot persuade the pigfaced lady to
unmask at any price the jack tar is quite pleased with
his night's cruise and is continually singing out what a
prime shindy my messmates harlequin is trying it on 
with the lady near him to become his columbine and if
she will but consent to his wishes he declares that with only
a touch his bat he can make her happiness complete the
wine had been pushed about so briskly during the time 
supper that the most numerous part the company from its
potent effects were fast losing their diffidence and reserve
which had rendered them so dull and flat the previous part 
the evening and were getting as lively and as gay as could be
wished each contributing somehow or oilier towards the mirth
and variety the scene
supper being over the stage once more became thronged
with characters that might be said to be more alive than
heretofore and reeling with several them required no
assumption to execute new steps tom as giovanni amorously
paid his court to all the ladies that crossed his path from the
squeamish nun to the saucy poll slammerkin and being
elevated with wine the various modes he took introducing
himself to the females according to the difference the
characters they represented produced considerable mirth and
knife
a masquerade supper 
laughter jerry was also primed for any pursuit and he
hunted up the game throughout all the groups with the true
spirit a sportsman almost splitting the ears many the
delicate fair ones who complained the loudness his
viewhalloo logic by this time was completely in for it 
and rather troubled with the hiccough which was fast increasing
upon him from the copious libations he had taken at the
suppertable drinking to the shrines venus and bacchus
till he had become quite comical and with a bottle and glass
in his hand was dancing and singing though a little faulty in
his recollection 
then all get drunk if you wish to be happy 
to shun pleasure that courts you is stupid and sappy
drink away you be nobly repaid for your labour 
why twill make you as happy again as your neighbour
since friendship s so rare and so bright a jewel

with wine make your clay so moist and so supple
instead one friend why you meet with a couple
thus were the world drunk twould double their pleasure 
the drunken miser would double his treasure 
a city feast would have double the covers 
and ladies would double the lists their lovers 
the drunkard two bowls as he s drinking and roaring 
and if you were all drunk you'd my song be encoring
then all get drunk o
jerry dashing along in his hunting career was so intent
upon the scene before him that he had nearly passed his fair
nun who was in company with another female without
observing her when his eye suddenly caught sight her
lovely shape as she was about to quit the masquerade hawthorn
in an instant was all raptures and with more
boldness than prudence he immediately made up to her and
 life in london
in a low tone voice almost a whisper said my fair nun
i have made out your riddle i beg your pardon i ought to
have addressed you as my dear lady wan hush
for heaven's sake hush replied the lady dropping the arm
 her companion and retreating a few steps the baronet is
near at hand and if you expose me here i shall be ruined
for ever only let me fair nun claim your promise 
then hid me out i will you greet
kindly welcome when next we meet
and i be as silent as a poacher cried jerey not now
you must not press it at the present moment indeed you
must not answered the lady time is precious said
hawthorn and i cannot part with you without i have
your promise fulfilled let us meet at on 
quit me instantly then replied the lady as she perceived
the baronet coming towards her and it shall be so jeery
immediately seized her hand and kissed it when the fair nun
joined her companion and the eyes jeeey never lost sight
 them till they left the masquerade
jerry was now tired his character and went in search 
tom and logic to communicate this second adventure but
the trio by this time was too much out joint to be
made up for any active pursuits again during that evening 
and they had even separated without logic's usual comic
goodbye 
when shall we three meet again
in lightning thunder hail or rain 
where they went or how they spent their time is not worth
the trouble inquiring let it suffice it to state that neither
tom jerry nor logic found their way to corinthian house
on bidding adieu to the masquerade
a masquerade supper 
however a day had scarcely passed over before our trio
again collected together and in their morning's lounge took a
turn into bond street as several the public characters
passed through this fashionable place resort logic pointed
out most them to jeery and related a variety anecdotes
concerning their importance and their different walks in
society there is one the most amiable and worthy 
her sex said the oxonian as a lady in company with an
elderly gentleman rode by them in their coachandfour and
some twenty years ago she was distinguished at one our
theatresroyal as a most lively and interesting actress her
talents were acknowledged to be the first order and she
was a great and deserved favourite with the public her
humour was intuitive it was genuine but it was not that
sort oi caricatures grimace which disgraces several our present
comic performers who in too many instances appear to prefer
raising a laugh at their ovn expense rather than not provoke one
at all this lady if my recollection serve me was a pupil the
representative the comic muse at that period a most finished
actress in her peculiar line and in her zenith quite an idol
for years she lived in the utmost splendour from the exercise
 her extraordinary and delightful talents and brought up a
numerous family but the remembrance her cruel wretched
unmerited neglected exit cannot fail in eliciting a tear from
the admirers unrivalled abilities and lovers the drama
but i am wandering from my previous subject observed
logic the fame the lady i was first talking about was
not confined to the metropohs alone she was equally an
object attraction in all the great provincial towns in
england and in her visits to dublin she took the lead in her
profession but this lady has retired from the stage for
several years and is now the affectionate wife the
elderly gentleman you saw herwith one the most eminent
 life in london
and wealthy bankers in the metropolis by this marriage
she has become related to three the most distinguished
families in the state who at different periods as to political
matters have been considered as highly important in fact
she may be viewed as the motherinlaw a marquis an
earl and a baronet one the oldest and most independent
in principle that rank in the kingdom it is true there is
a vast disparity years between the parties but the propriety
 conduct observed by the lady united with real love
and attachment which she possesses for her husband is the
subject praise by all those persons yao are in habits 
intimacy with them indeed in their behaviour towards each
other they represent a second darby and joan in spite a
once celebrated poet's satire on matrimony 
hail wedded love the bard thy beauty hails 
though mix'd at times with cockandhenlike sparring
but calms are very pleasant after gales
and dovelike peace much sweeter after earrings
i ve written i forget the page indeed 
but folks may find it if they choose to read 
that marriage is too sweet without some sour 
variety oft recommends afiow't
wedlock should be like punch some sweet some acid 
then life is nicely turbulent iai placid
a picture that is all light 
lord what a thing a very fright 
no let some darkness be display d 
and learn to balance well with shade
the husband this lady although so nearly allied with
political families so diametrically opposite to each other yet
he has decidedly nothing to do with politics his character
shines as a connoisseur in pictures possessing a fine taste an
ardent admirer music a most lasting and impassioned
 masquerade supper 
attachment for the drama with a sensible head and a feeling
heart to direct the whole his pursuits the sons royalty
have often been regaled at his festive board and even the
king himself in the most affable manner has graced this
couple with his presence
but mrs however highly distinguished by her
performances on the stage has proved herself a much greater
actress on the large theatre the world one her principle
studies is to do good to relieve the really distressed
family to succour and cherish the unfortunate to make old
age happy and comfortable to raise drooping merit and to
rescue it from oblivion charitable and humane upon all
occasions dignified without pomp and feeling and honest
without any marks ostentation an open and an avowed
enemy to silly upstart pride a charming and interesting
companion possessing an enlarged mind a most sincere
friend an honourable and highlygifted acquaintance a lady
at all times and a real ornament to her sex her elevation
and the enjoyment immense property said logic has
taught mrs to know the advantages riches to distribute
them with a sensible and feeling discernment for the
benefit mankind and instead becoming the hatred and
envy surrounding circles to obtain the praise society in
general acting as a model for those females who sincerely
wish to do good to others as well as to themselves such is
the character that lady mrs may her charitable
hand then said jerry never be in want supplies
the corinthian now proposed to introduce jerry to mr
jackson as they were so near his rooms and also to
become a subscriber you are an old acquaintance logic
s life in london
said toms and if you like we will have a little exercise
together no not today i thank you i am too ticklish
in the wind at present replied the oxonian without farther
delay our heroes paid a visit to this celebrated teacher the
art selfdefence the room which is most accurately
represented in the annexed plate might be deemed a
corinthian setout altogether and no man is more deserving
 the appellation corinthian jack than mr jackson
indeed he is acknowledged to be such by the very first
classes society from that selfknowledge propriety
gentlemanly deportment and anxiety to please which plays
round his character at all times servility is not known to
him flattery he detests integrity impartiality goodnature
and manliness are the cornerstones his understanding
from the highest to the lowest person in the sporting
world his decision is law he never makes a bet therefore
he has no undue influence on his mind there is nothing
creeping or throwing the hatchet about this description
it is the plain and naked truth the writer it fears no
refutation and those persons who are acquainted with life
in london he feels confident wil back it to the very echo
his room is not common to the public eye but nevertheless
the taste it is not caviare to the million no person can be
admitted without an introduction as a teacher the art
 selfdefence mr jackson has no competitor
while tom was engaged in settingto with mr jackson
jerry in order not to pass his time in idleness was weighed
to decide a bet between him and logic for a rump and a dozen
jerry lost it having proved lbs above stone bob
was in high glee having queered the countryman as he termed
him in one corner the room a picture is to be seen framed
and glazed with the following inscriptions painted upon it and
a masquerade supper 
which is a present from the eight hon w gingham
map to mr jackson
the fatal effects a eoman quarrel in the piazza del
populi la coltellata in the eoman costume the subject in
question represents a person ijring dead killed by an assassin
who is seen making his escape with the dagger in his hand
women and children are shrieking with agony over the body
several men in cloaks looking at the deed terrified as it were
yet all afraid to stop the flight the assassin
humbly recommended to the consideration those who are
labouring to abolish what is called the brutal and ferocious practice
 boxing
when comparisons are made said logic to jerry the
above plate speaks volumes in favour the manly and
generous mode resorted to by englishmen to resent an insult
or to decide a quarrel
on quitting bond street tom asked his companions
if they would go with him to the city as he had a purchase
to make at a jeweller's upon lydgate hill to which they
both acquiesced it was to choose a diamondnecklace for
corinthian kate in order to make up for the neglect
which tom felt he had committed in not taking her with
him to the masquerade tom spared no expense in the
purchase which was soon made and upon the return home
 the trio through fleet market on passing the prison
logic said to jerry if ever i am screwed up within these
walls i hope you will not forget to cal and see an old friend
smiling there is many a true word spoken in jest replied
the corinthian but come let us make haste home we will
 life in london
take an early dinner and if you have no objection i will introduce
you to the champion england as it will he in
unison with our morning's visit and most likely it will also
lead to another jolly night i am always ready for anything
you propose answered logic and i should like it all
things replied jerry let us then be off as soon as you
please my dear coz it was not long after dinner when the
trio repaired to the house the champion and jerry and
logic were introduced by tom to this pugilistic hero hawthorn
was particularly pleased ivith the appearance the
parlour which the plate represents it being filled with
numerous portraits and other sporting subjects the corinthian
is showing the silver cup to jerry and logic which
was presented to the champion from the sporting world

address thomas cribb i have the honour this day 
being the representative a numerous and most respectable
body your friends and though i am by no means qualified
to attempt the undertaking which has devolved on me by a
vote the subscribers yet the cause will i am confident
prove a sufficient excuse for my want ability you are
requested to accept this cup as a tribute respect for the
uniform valour and integrity you have shown in your several
combats but most particularly for the additional proofs 
native skill and manly intrepidity displayed by you in your
last memorable battles when the cause rested not merely upon
individual fame but for the pugilistic reputation your native

in that combat you gave proof that the innovating hand a

gentlemen present and the sons john bull in general will

logic whose comic mug was always on the grin filled out

jerry here goes it is the most pleasant mode cupping
a man that i ever heard the room speaks for itself it
can be seen at all times and therefore it may be identified
when any person thinks proper the champion was blowing
a cloud always happy and contented and had just taken off
those jack boots which stand at the bottom the table and
which weigh twenty pounds at the same time observing if
they can't use their fists quicker in france than they do their

with all the skill a prize pugilist and ultimately being the
death them the punch was soon finished logic puffed
out his sugar and upon fat boh the guard roaring out in a
hoarse voice like thunder to his companion i say come lush
jem and let us toddle or else you see ve shall be too late for i
know there's a precious moi going from our yard this hint
though not meant to do any injury was not very friendly towards
the landlord but it was quite sufficient to clear the
room all his customers in a twinkle who brushed off as fast
as possible towards the westminster pit
on the arrival the trio at the pit jerey expressed
his surprise at the crowd persons which had assembled
round the doors anxiously waiting to obtain an admittance
what a motley group exclaimed hawthorn to tom
as he surveyed fluefathers duster lamplighters stagecoachmen
bakers farmers barristers swells butchers dogfancies
grooms donkeyboys weavers snobs marketmen
watermen honourables sprigs nobility mps mailguards
sivaddies c all in one rude contact jostling and pushing
against each other when the doors were opened to procure
a front seat yes my dear coz it is a motley group
replied tom but it is a view real life and it is
from such meetings as these notwithstanding they are
termed very low that you have a fine opportunity witnessing
the difference the human character in the circles
 fashion you scarcely meet with any contrast whatever
you will recollect jerry said tom smiling they are all
sporting characters and are all touched more or less sith the
scene before them and the fluemaker wil drop his bender with
as much pluck as the honourable does his fifty to support his
opinion the spirit is quite the same and it is only the blunt
upon subjects like the present that makes the difference 
life in london
tween the persons in question no boxkeepers are here
jekry to keep places till the first act fight i mean is over
exclaimed logic with a prime grin on his face the loud
barking the dogs the singularity the remarks and the
confidence and ease with which every greasy hero or sooty chief
placed himself by the side the swells without making any
apology as feeling that he had a right so to do in treading
upon a coat or dirtying the apparel the person next to him
tickled the feelings jerry more than he could express the
plate is a correct representation the animation displayed
upon this subject by the gay tykeboys and most their
tiobs for low cunning are able to get the best the keenest
barristers in the kingdom and would form a fine subject for a
sporting lecture upon heads it may also be seen that
quite as much anxiety prevails in this pit on the termination
 an event as upon the decision the derby stakes at epsom
faces upon entering the above canine theatre jerry's
sneezer was touched with some convulsive efforts so that his
ogle was continually at work which corinthian tom observing
asked hawthorn with a smile upon his face if he did
not like perfumery as the pit was as highly scented as gattie's
what you a sporting man jerry and not love a good scent 
fie keep no more dogs then 
the dogpit was filled in a few minutes and numerous
persons went away grumbling as if they had lost the finest
sight in the world at the disappointment they had met within
not being able to procure places some little delay having
occurred before the performances commenced a costardmonger
from the upper story roared out i say governor how long
are ve to be kept in this here rookery before you give us a sight

a masquerade supper 
 this phenomena jacco maccacco was at length produced
in a handsome little wooden house amidst the shouts and
loud whistling the audience but he was not polite enough
to bow in return for this mark approbation paid to him
jacco had a small chain about two yards in length placed
round his loins which was fastened to a strong iron stake
drove a considerable depth into the ground he was then let
out his house the dog was immediately brought and let
fly at him but the monkey previous to this attack gathered
himself up with as much cunning as a prizefighter would do
in order to repel the shock the dog immediately got him
down and turned him up but the monkey in an instant
with his teeth which met together like a saw made a large
wound in the throat the dog as if done with a knife and
from the great loss blood the dogs in general sustained
who were pitted against jacco maccacco several them
died soon afterwards the monkey seldom met with an
injury in any these contests but he is so ferocious a
nature that his master deems it prudent to have a plate 
iron before him in case he might make a mistake and bite
his legs ivhat a deep covey said a greasy butcher
with his mouth open a red nightcap on his nob and pointing
towards jack maccacco i bet a thigh mutton
and smash that the monkey wins blow me tight if ever i saw
such a thing in my life before it really is wonderful and
what a punisher too why he seems to mill the dogs with as
much ease and sagacity as if he had been fighting matcheswith
them for years a small volume might be filled with the
singular remarks and gestures made by this noisy motley group
on the finishing qualities possessed by jacco maccacco some
laughed others shouted vehemently and numbers them
 turnips and caper sauce a prominent article among pothouse gamblers
 life in london
were continually jumping up and down in a sort ecstacy
knocking their sticks against the ground not unlike the inmates
 the lunatic asylum when free from their sfraiiwaistcoats
the matches being over some clean water was thrown over
the monkey in order to refresh him when he appeared little
the worse from the effects his battles and was immediately
put into his wooden house i would not said jerry to
tom have missed this curious scene for a trifle but if you
had not given me the hint i should most certainly have lost
my money i had not the least idea that so small a monkey
nay if any monkey at all could have done such terrible execution
 then make haste and draw the hunt urged logic
or perhaps as you are an entire stranger to the stakeholder
he soon may be non est inventus such things i assure you
have happened in pits a better description than westminster

on quitting this dogfanciers theatre the oxonian observed
to his companions that the neighbourhood tothul fields was
so truly prolific life and fun that as they were on the spot
it would be a pity to lose the opportunity therefore if they
had no objection he should like to take a peep into several 
the houses merely to see what was going on we may as
well finish the night gaily said logic with all our hearts
answered tom and jerry lead on bob and we wil
follow public and other houses were explored without loss
 time and it was a poor shop indeed that did not produce
some little amusement and even something character
li most the instances the contrasts were fine interesting
and profitable the soldiers and their tulls were seen tossing
 a cant phrase for a publichouse for instance such a shop is a
prime place for fun
a masquerade supper 
off the heavy wet and spirits and feeling perhaps more actual
enjoyment than their generals and their ladies who have all
the advantages riches and fortune to produce them comforts
and to make them happy the dissipation the guards
said tom i have heard is equal to anything you can mention
in the metropolis many them are tradesmen who work
hard when off duty earn a great deal money but spend it as
freely as princes they also live on the best provisions are
full gallantry and keep their girls yet it is true however
extraordinary it may appear that no soldiers in the british
army are better disciplinarian than the guards men who
have endured the greatest fatigue and privations when in
actual service and who upon all occasions have performed
prodigies valour yet when at home and in quarters they
are determined to enjoy all the good things belonging to
society singing 
how happy s the soldier who lives on his pay
that spends halfacrown out sixpence a day 
he fears neither bailiffs nor yet any dun
but he rattles away sith the rou his drum
the king finds him money quarters and clothes
and he cares not a marked how the world goes 
but row de dow c
costardmongers and flying duster were also blowing a
cloud with their fancy vonien cadgers enjoying a good supper
laughing at the flmts they had imposed upon in begging
for charity's sake in the course the day fishfags who
had turned their marketings to a good account and the prigs
 this is frequently done by many persons in london hat for further
particulars or an explanation upon this paradoxical subject how it is to
be accomplished an inquiry at the fleet king's bench newgate
whiteness street and marshalsea prisons will no doubt prove satisfactory
even to the most sceptical
 life in london
with their flowers spending the produce the day and all
in appearance as happy and comfortable in their minds as if
they were in the possession thousands a year the more
scenes iwitness said jerry to logic the more i am
surprised i have heard talk the varieties life in
london but what i have already seen beggars anything like
attempt at description
jerry had scarcely uttered these words when in rushed
chaffing peter well known in tothill fields as the oracle the
duster piping hot from the old bailey with an account 
one lummy belonging to the flying squad who had been
tried for stealing a pair breeches dirty sujce whose face
hadn't had anything like a piece soap across it for many a
long day and who had a sort sneaking kindness for lummy
began now to nay her lib but the tears could not roll down
her cheeks for the dirt lummy was reckoned a trump among
the costardmongera and some sorrow was excited upon his
lorry hard fate peter said suke did not lummy sert his
innocence come tell us vat he said for himself to the judge

 most persons who are in the habit going from one publichouse to
another and drinking a number drams in the course a day in order
a masquerade suffer 
whcli tom jerry and logic were compelled to swallow intreating
several the characters they had accidentally mixed
with the trio were getting rather funny indeed logic was
so taken with the rolling eye the plump wanton figure and
slang chaffing slippery sall in the oyster line that the
corinthians had some difficulty in stalling mm off he was so
nutty upon the charms this fair one the tub the
oxonian with a half hiccough wds continually singing out
here s a champaign country as we say at oxford 
in one house at which the trio called in their road home
a fustian's wedding was being celebrated with all the low
peculiarities belonging to that class society and jerry
laughed heartily at the following old flash song which one 
the party was roaring out with a voice like a stentor to some
 the ladies the dusthi
you gentlemen give ear unto my ditty
it s as true a chaunt as ever you did hear
it s concerning the scouts the city
and those rascals you never need to fear 
you must know from a rum teen we bundled

when turning the corner old bedlam
a scout laid me fiat upon my face

 ardent spirits frequently take a glass porter which is termed a
cooler a damper c and too many individuals hard drinkers flatter
themselves that from such sort care they are keeping the nails out 
their coffins till the trembling hand the diseased appetite and the
debilitated constitution lamentably point out the fatal error too late to
be corrected

no sooner the blow i had recovered
than up i got and stood upon my pins
crying b you you old blind b 
i make your lantern jaws for to ring 
i took him such a lick his nvwm'mer
and tinged his rattle clean out his hand 
that i soon had him down in a minute
when his canister came slap against his stand

one my companions coming up
when he heard the report the blow
saying well done my nice one you have done it
to another these rascals let us go 
and as we were rolling it along sir 
a night guardian we found fast asleep
ashen we owned with his box in a minute
and tumbled the old charley in the street i
fal de dal de dal de dido
avell thought said tom smiling this song has reminded
me a bit fun which i had intended jerry to
have shown you before you left london it is getting the
best a charley and i will put you up to it before we go to
sleep tonight after one or two more flashes lightning the
trio were again on the toddle and logic reeled his way through
parliament street after his companions without any music
and also stumbled through some part the strand but he was
missing before toi and jerry arrived at temple bar never
mind said the corinthian there is no danger bob's
being lost he may be trusted alone he knows too well the
advantages a key to be locked out a lodging
tom finding the old charley fast asleep laughingly observed
to jerry who was in toil streets with a couple 
a knowing one a man not to be imposed upon
 being decoyed or persuaded by any person
 masquerade supper 
cyprians now we'll have the best him i soon wake
this dealer out time from his dream and as the plate so
admirably delineates the scene 
twas silence all around and clear the coast
the watch as usual dozing on his post 
and scarce a lamp display'd a glimmering light 
tom had the charley in his box down in an instant hawthorn
laughed immoderately at the dexterity tom and
with the utmost glee said to the corinthian my dear coz
the charley had the best us last time at bow street
but we have got the best him now and therefore let us keep
it the above cant phrase puzzled jerry considerably ashen
it was first made use by tom but on its being radically
illustrated he observed that person must be a cripple indeed
if ever the watchman overtook him on such an occasion
indeed it is totally impossible under such circumstances for a
charles to extricate himself without the assistance some 
his brother guardians the night the noise made by the
watchman to get out his box broke in upon the ears 
another old scout across the road who half asleep and without
knowing what was the matter sprang his rattle for assistance
let us be off said tom it won't do to remain here any
longer the two cyprians in the most tender and persuasive
manner now endeavoured to gammon jerry and the corinthian
up shire lane to a place safety as they termed it
no replied tom i rather think not your house i am
afraid is not insured but i must admit your policy is not a
had one neither 
it is quite immaterial how our heroes eluded the pursuit 
the charleys or in what manner they spent the remainder 
 life in london
the night they were out on a three and were determined
to finish it they were not immaculate one circumstance
however is very clear logic found his companions in a
whole skin on paying a visit to corinthian home the next
morning

his acquaintances tom and logic had bid adieu to anything
like regularity living long before hawthorn made up the
trio and had only gone to repose or left their beds as circumstances
required daylight had frequently ushered both them
into their apartments before sleep had overtaken their eyes 
and they had as frequently in succession got up by candlelight
in the evening to enjoy their breakfasts jerry under such
masters soon became an apt pupil or rather caught the contagion

the clock had struck one at corinthian rouse before our
heroes descended into the cluiffmg crib when tom with a
smile observed to jerky
 we take no note time but by its loss 
the teathings were scarcely removed before the door opened
and again presented the comical face logic to his merry
companions why bob said jerry laughing if i am
not mistaken you were lost in the fields temptation last
cate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
night you stole a march upon us no goodbye no
no answered tom logic was very busy in the oyster
line only look at him he appears quite harassed i must
confess replied the oxonian that i have not exactly recovered
from the severe effects the repeated flashes 
lightning and strong claps thunder with which i had to
encounter last night indeed i could not resist the fury the
storm and ultimately my little frail bark was stranded and
went down well done master logic observed jeery
so you think to creep out it by punning but it won't do 
you are caught come said the corinthian it is getting
late and i have no time to spare i am going to tattersall's
to purchase aprad upon the judgment jerry and
you may as well go with us bob logic acquiesced when
the trio were off like a shot and soon arrived at the above
grand sporting rendezvous which the print so clearly illustrates
this scene is so very familiar to a certain part the public
and can also be identified at any period that it scarcely requires
a comment but to a great portion society in the metropolis
who are quite aloof from sporting transactions a short
account this most celebrated repository may prove not
altogether unacceptable the group characters speaks for
itself but it is impossible to pass over the i's yorkshire cove
endeavouring to gammon jerry about the fine action the
horse before them hawthorn with a smile on his countenance
in return asked yorkshire if he saw anything green
about him this hint was quite sufficient for tom and the
corinthian informed tattersall that he would not have
the pray in question as a gift logic laughed at the
rotundity amhca a person near jerry and by way a
pun said he supposed it was the great horsedealer 
jerry expressed himself so much pleased with his visit to
s
 life in london
tattersall's that he observed to logic during his stay in
london he should often frequent it i delight said hawthorn
 to be in the company sportsmen and no objects
afford me greater satisfaction than the sight a fine hunter 
the view a highmettled racer and the look oi z perfect
greyhounds i admire them also replied the corinthian 
and tattersall's will always prove an agienable lounge if
no direct purpose call a person thither if nothing more than
information be acquired that alone jerry to a man the
world is valuable at all times besides tattersall's gives a
tone to the sporting world in the same way that the transactions
on the eoyal exchange influence the mercantile part 
society it has likewise its settling days after the great races
at newmarket doncaster epsom ascot c i do not know
about the hulls and hears but if it has no lame ducks to waddle
out it has sometimes decanters that wil not show for a time
and others that wil irish off altogether but this does not
happen very often and tattersall's has its ootz rien as
well as the change and whose word will be taken for any
amount it has also its subscription room which is extremely
convenient for gentlemen and other persons who feel
any inclination to become acquainted with the events the
sporting world at the moderate charge one guinea a year
indeed continued tom there is an air sporting about
this place altogether elegance cleanliness and style being
its prominent features the company i admit is a mixture 
after seven descents lord oxford it is said obtained the object for
which he had been bo solicitous without any diminution speed or the
beauties shape and symmetry a perfect greyhound

persons nearly all ranks in life but nevertheless it is that
sort mixture which is pleasingly interesting there is no
intimacy or association about it a man may be well known
here he may also in his turn know almost everybody that visits
tattersall's and yet be quite a stranger to their habits and
connexions with society it is no matter who sells or who purchases
at this repository a het stands as good with a leg and
is thought as much as with a peer money being the
touchstone the circumstance the best judge respecting
sporting events is acknowledged the best man here every
person being on the look out to see how he lays his hunt
the dunce and the parliamentary orator if they do not know
the properties a horse are little more than cyphers it is true
they may be stared at if pointed out as great characters but
nothing more the nod from a stablekeeper is quite as important
if not more so to the auctioneer as the ivinjc a eight
honoukible numbers persons who visit tattersall's
are or wish to appear zrwojcmy from which sez importance
they are often most egregiously duped in short if you are
not as familiar vrith the odds upon all events as chitty in
quoting precedents show as intimate an acquaintance with
the pedigree and speed racehorses as a gulley and also
display as correct a knowledge the various capabilities the
prize pugilists as a jackson if gain is your immediate
object you are no use at tattersall's yes says
logic vrith a grin interrupting tom there are to be found
here as manj flats and slips as would furnish the score a
musical composer and several these instruments have been
so much played upon and are so wretchedly out tune that

it is the tiptop sporting feature in london it must have

such a famous connexion yes replied tom you are
quite right it is not the work a day the name 
tattersall is not only high but long standing in the
sporting world and everything connected with this splendid
establishment is conducted in the most gentlemanly manner
the founder these premises was during his time viewed as
one the best judges horseflesh in the kingdom and as a
proof it he made his fortune by a horse called highflyer
in remembrance whom the following epitaph was written

kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
the trio upon quitting tattkrsall's took a walk into
hyde park when logic hinted to his companions that byway
 a contrast to their last night's excursion an hour or two
in the evening might very well be disposed at the italian
opera i should not have the least objection said tom
but i have made an engagement to drink tea hath eliteshe
wishes me to hear her sing a new song she has recently
acquired and i cannot disappoint her indeed since jerry
has been in town she has had very little my company
apropos exclaimed logic i claim your promise an
introduction to corinthian kate and i too urged
jerry eagerly it shall be so my friends if you promise
to keep the line answered tom you shall be admitted
into the preserve but remember no poaching logic you
have an excellent touch on the pianoforte kate is excessively
fond music and you will therefore be a most welcome
visitor jerry's merry song and lively company will also
ensure him a good reception i shall do everything in my
power to promote perfect harmony and i think we may at
least picture to ourselves a few gay moments but let us
return home as soon as possible as i have ordered an earlier
dinner than usual that i might keep to my appointment
the progress the trio was interrupted for a short period
in their way to corinthian house through the streets with the
following dialogue between a costardmonger and his woman
whose donkey had accidentally slipped one his feet into a
plughole
jerry laughed as heartily as if he had been witnessing a
pantomime indeed the scene altogether was highly ludicrous
 to behave in a becoming manner not to forget one's self 
 life in london
tom smiled and logic was on the broad grin vy don't
you mind vcd you re after said poll instead rolling your
goggles about after all manner people it loud be much better
for you if you did i knows here don't you see all the carrots
and greens that cost me every mag i coud raise last night will
be down in the dirt and not worth one brass jar den burst
you replied bill angrily if you don't hold that are red rag
 yours i spoil your mouth for a murdh you are always
making a bad matter worse that s vat you are so help me g 
then turning to the donkey and roaring out vat you ve got
your foot in a plughole and be d d to ye have ye 
didn't i buy you last night pay for you this morning and
brought you home in a hayband vat more d ye want heh 
such obstinate devils as you are are never satisfied but i 
sarve you out for it that s vat i will bill at length released
the donkey's toddler out trouble and giving the poor
animal some terrible blows with a stick roared out to him 
if you don't mind vat you re after now i cut your precious
rump off the donkey soon mended his pace and our heroes
kept laughing at the circumstance till they arrived at corinthian
house
the cloth being removed and after the circulation a few
glasses wine tom observed it was time to be off the
carriage was immediately ordered and in a very short time
the trio found themselves in the presence the heroine the
tale tom was the master the ceremonies upon this occasion
and logic and jerey received a flattering smile on their
introduction to kate when the latter without delay presented
to the notice her visitors her companion the lovely
susan matters etiquette being adjusted it was not long
before the tea was introduced logic who was never at a
loss for conversation was gay and witty upon the passing
kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
occurrences the day ie such occurrences as were most likely
to please females sales by candle prices hay and the
value shares in the different canal companies did not intrude
upon the oxonian's mind it was in a much lighter field 
conversation that he played off his artillery with success it
was in praising the sylphlike figure attitudes and admirable
dancing miss tree the balladsinging mrs land tha
inimitable pathetic touches miss kelly the plaintive heartfelt
musical notes miss stephens the acting miss taylor 
the modest unassuming miss smithson the bewitching
madame vestris and the captivating miss o'neil that logic
commanded attention bob knew the time when to be a
lady's man as well as to be without the screaming qualities a
lady's maid in a row he was well aware there was a time for
everything and no one knew better how to accommodate
himself to all sorts company than the lively intelligent
oxonian tom was equally elegant but so finished in all his
remarks that decision seemed to rest upon his lips jerry
though not quite so eloquent as his two friends nevertheless
contributed with much humour towards the chitchat the teatable
if a horse a bird or a dog could have been cleverly
introduced jerry would have shown himself a firstrate hero 
however his eyes had been sufficiently opened in his banishes
and sprees with the corinthian and logic to see his way
more clearly upon the present occasion than he otherwise could
have done kate highly attractive from her fine person and
superior manners soon convinced the oxonian and jerry
 in the character jeanie deans in the heart midlothian as
dramatised by t dibden esq that individual who can witness the
exertions miss taylor without shedding a tear must be made 
inflexible stuff indeed it is one the finest triumphs the art 
acting the delusion the stage elect is so far forgotten that the
powers nature only seem to prevail
so life in london
that it was not from her decorations alone she became an object
 attention and sue interesting from her loveliness and
simplicity made a much greater impression upon the surrounding
group than all the art in the world could have done towards
elevating her in the minds the persons present such was
the gay party assembled nay more it was a liberal one
it was most certainly a party with too many faults belonging
to it but yet not a single absent friend or a neighbour were
served up as a dish scandal where every person present
could help himself to a slice 
both logic and jerry had only'seen corinthian kate
m passant amidst the bustle and gay throng the park and
they had yet to encounter the danger her charms and
fascinating attractions when increased from the advantages 
dress and heightened by the most lively and impressive talents
during the chitchat at the teatable jerry could scarcely keep
his eyes ofi kate hawthorn in consequence at times
blushed appeared confused was aware it was extremely vulgar
knew that such conduct was wrong and also that it was not
the behaviour a gentleman but above all that it was
acting unkind towards his friend and cousin yet in spite 
all these honourable feelings and checks which he endeavoured
to keep upon himself he often transgressed into a downright
stare as if under the influence some powerful magnet that
he could not resist 
for her own person
it beggar'd all description 
o'er picturing that venus where we see
the fancy outwork nature
the oxonian too with all his experience in these matters
would have been equally at a loss to have known what
to have done with his optics as he afterwards remarked
kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
if his green specs had not operated as a prime hedge for him 
and in all probability had not the corinthian been present
the gallantry logic would have tempted him to have repeated
the words the poet as a compliment to the mistress
 his friend 
angels were painted fair to look like you 
upon the removal the teathings very little time was
suffered to elapse before tom gave the hint to logic that
gay moments were too precious to be wasted the pianoforte
was at his service and the company were anxiously waiting
to hear him commence the harmony the evening logic
required no further invitation and immediately took his seat
at the instrument but before he had half finished the air 
when to lovely woman's powers
man submits his enraptured soul 
he culls life's sweetest flow'rs
his hours in pleasure roll 
no other joys invading
tempts deluded man to istiay 
blest alone with love pervading
she bends him to her sway
lovely woman 
lovely lovely woman 
man's best and dearest gift life 
kate and sue complimented the oxonian on his musical
talents indeed these gay moments the party were
enriched by each them displaying their various talents to
prevent the intrusion ennui or in other words to avoid
the had manners looking at their watches lolling and
 to hedge off or it s a prime hedge for me are phrases repeatedly
made use in the sporting world when an individual wishes to save
himself from any serious consequences
 life in l fond on
yawning and picking their teeth which too often occur
when time hangs heavy on the hands a company destitute
 abilities
the eloquence jerry was not the worse for a few glasses
 wine and logic very frequently turned round full 
humour bidding his companions to keep time and to pay
attention to the man in the orchestra tom who had already
plied the oxonian with several bumpers handed him another
glass wine and observed with a smile that it would be
impossible to neglect a man his great taste 
if ever time had passed merrily in any company it might
be said to have positively flown away among this gay party
pleasure was their idol it was the creature their imagination
 and no heroes ever offered more sacrifices at its attractive
shrine than did our trio they were devotees to pleasure
morning noon and night logic at all times possessed so
much gaiety de cur that no assemblage persons could be
dull for an instant in his presence the corinthian was
equally so in disposition if not gifted with talents even a
higher cast to amuse and interest a company and hawthorn
the laughing goodnatured jerry if he could not chatter like
a magpie ujjon all subjects that were introduced into conversation
yet no one departed from his society with an impression
that a dummy had taken his seat amongst them
equally devoted to gaiety and pleasure were our heroines 
but the dispositions corinthian kate and the lovely sue
were diametrically opposite to each other kate was proud
a cant phrase for a stupid fellow a man who has not a word to say
for himself the family the dummies is very numerous
kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
yet dignified commanding but polite and conscious her
own fine person and its powerful influence upon the opposite
sex she left nothing untried that could tend to improve it
she could smile at a comic incident and shed tears over a
pathetic tale but it was more from the impulse the
moment than any deep impression they had made upon her
feelings and when these convulsive efforts had subsided they
were nearly forgotten by her for ever kate too was fond
 accomplishments not precisely as accomplishments but on

that tender symptom which operates so penetratingly on the

palpitations the heart and creates confusion in the breasts
 females and yet cannot be accounted for but so it is 
no it was her ambition that had sealed the contract it
was the splendid fortune tom his elegant figure his
superior abilities his great character and his being the ton
that had fastened upon her eye and kate preferred the envy
 her sex in securing such a hero to herself rather than to
be pitied for loving him without obtaining a conquest being
lost as it were to the world and sighing and pining in some
private corner propriety and even character had been
leaped over in order to gratify her ambition and even sinning

said he has excited your astonishment from her dignity

she required not the aid art to render it more effective but
which tended to make her simplicity doubly captivating
the mildness sue's disposition was unfortunately the means
 her becoming a sacrifice to her designing protector sincere
in her own professions love she believed the emphatic vows
 her hero to be equally true and therefore had yielded to
his entreaties but in return sue found herself deceived for
her generous unlimited affection she had not one grain 
harshness in her whole composition she could also boast 
accomplishments equal to corinthian kate but sue was
more reserved in displaying them as ambition did not fire her
brain to excel other females in beauty grandeur or talents
in short lovely sue partook more the interesting tender
companion than the highmotioned extravagant dashing mistress
the dispositions our heroines not coming in contact
with each other they were intimate friends and kate was
extremely partial to sue who was her neighbour and also a
frequent visitor females in general it should seem are not
very fond introducing pretty women to the company 
their male acquaintances but sue was viewed more in the
light a pretty foil by corinthian irate than in the dangerous
character a powerful rival it was under this
impression that the lovely sue was invited to meet the
trio
after the oxonian had played several pieces lively music
he requested as a favour that kate and his friend tom would
have the kindness to reform a waltz kate without any
hesitation immediately stood up tom offered his hand to his
fascinating partner logic struck up a favourite air when
this lascivious dance took place the plate conveys a correct
representation the gay scene at that precise moment the
anxiety the oxonian to witness the attitudes this elegant
 life in london
pair had nearly put a stop to their movements on his turning
rouni from the pianoforte and presenting his comical mug to
their notice crying out bravo t it was with the utmost
difficulty that kate could suppress a laugh it had such a
risible effect upon her countenance and it was impossible for
the corinthian to assume anything like an air gravity upon
this occasion jeery was too much attracted by the charms
 lovely sue to notice the above circumstance or even to
spare the corner one his eyes to view the superior dancing
 kate and tom his time being completely occupied in
singing more after the style incledon than abraham to
the interesting object before him 
when i gazed on a beautiful face
or a form that my fancy approved 
i was pleased with its sweetness and grace
and falsely believed that i loved
per i could loot i could like i could leave
but i never loved any till now
as lovely sue was only a visitor like himself and not under
the immediate influence any person present jerry thought
there was no bar to his saying a thousand civil things to her 
and more especially as she did not appear offended at any 
his remarks
none the company were starters and both irate and
 the lateness the hour never had any influence upon the minds 
our trio while mirth was afloat and neither tom jebrt or logic
came under the denomination starters i our heroes were too fond 
pleasure to lose a single atom it and therefore they left it to the
eequtaes the eleven and twelve o'clock sort people who would not
stay a minute longer for the world to break up the utiles harmony
indeed it is very often experienced in society that when any person has
taken ha departure who had contributed in a great measure to the
kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
sue sang some delightful airs during the evening the song
and the glass had also passed very briskly round between the
trio till the face logic had assumed a shining aspect 
jerry was getting very merry and the corinthian quite
full spirits was laughing at a small piece torn paper
which he had just picked up off the carpet and respecting
which both kate and sue had denied having any knowledge
it contained the following sentences which tom read aloud 
mary devis begs leave to inform the ladies in general that
she answers all sorts difficult questions proposed to her ina
satisfactory manner nativities cast c and is to be heard
 this is some old fortuneteller i be sworn
says tom and if i knew the direction jerry you and i
would pay her a morning visit come ladies do not be so
unkind j give us the old hag's direction both kate and
sue blushed with confusion but again denied any knowledge
 the circumstance
logic at length grew tired performing on the pianoforte
and having no other companion to engage his attention begged
leave that the odd one as he termed himself might
retire the lovely sue also proposed taking her departure
when jerry with a squeeze the hand insisted upon
seeing her safe home thus it was the trio separated and
finished their gay moments for that sitting but under
a general promise that they would have another meeting the
first opportunity
logic according to promise kept his appointment to
mirth and amusement the evening a degree flatness has instantlypervaded
the scene the remaining company become dull and the
frequent result is a general separation the goodnights and the
goodeyes bo unsettle the party that it is impossible to keep them steady
afterwards
 life in london
meet our heroes at the eooms in st james's street to
witness the assault between corinthian tom and mr
o'shaunessy jerry expressed his admiration and logic
was also loud in his praise at the superior style displayed by
tom in the ornamental parade quarte and tierce and also at
the coolness and skill exhibited by the corinthian in the
grand assault indeed said logic as an amateur i never
saw any one equal to him and i really think that he would
puzzle if not be a competent match for many persons who call
themselves professors jerry you really must take a few
lessons from mr o'shaunessy before you return to haivthoni
hall it is an elegant accomplishment and no gentleman ought
to be without some knowledge it if it were not for my
green specs smiling i should like to have a bit a flourish
and demand a taste your quality before i suffered you to
depart i cannot my dear bob replied jerry expose my
ignorance fencing here but next time i meet you in the
chaffing crib if you like it i will show you hoi to use a cudgel
 there is no exercise says sir john sinclair in his code 
health and longevity with a view to health better entitled to the
attention those who are placed among the higher classes society than
that tending the positions the body in fencing have for their
objects erectness firmness and balance and in practising this art the
chest the neck and the shoulders are placed in positions the most
beneficial to health the various motions the arms and limbs whilst
the body maintains its erect position enables the muscles in general to
acquire vigorous strength and in young people the bones the chest
and thorax necessarily become more enlarged by means which a consumptive
tendency may be prevented various instances may be adduced
where fencing has prevented consumption and other disorders it has
been remarked also that those who practise this art are in general
remarkable for long lite and the good health they have enjoyed these
considerations combined with the graceful movements which it establishes
and the elegant means selfdefence which it furnishes certainly
render the art an object considerable importance

kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
only a small task no no answered logic that won't
pi the plate is an interesting pretty picture altogether 
and it must be admitted the fencers display great ease and
elegance in their attitudes mr o'shaunessy not only met
with a most flattering reception but he was pronounced a
complete master the art
on quitting the fencingrooms tom and jerry accompanied
logic to the albany where they bid goodbye to the
oxonian and in their way towards bedford square having
an appointment at that place hawthorn espied at a short
distance before him in russell street kate and sue tripping
it along as if in great haste jerry instantly mentioned the
circumstance to tom but the corinthian had scarcely caught
a glimpse their persons when they quickly turned down an
obscure narrow street and if the curiosity our heroes had
not been strongly excited so as to give them a run for it they
must have lost sight the ladies altogether having only
turned the corner the street time enough to witness their
entrance into a very shabby dirtylooking house jerry and
tom soon approached it the door being open sans ceremonie
they ascended the stairs upon which a brush did not appear to
have been used for many a day and indeed they were now
so covered with mud that a shovel would have been a far more
appropriate article before any water could have reached the
boards so as to restore them to anything like a decent appearance
our heroes however were not to be deterred in their
ascent and they arrived at the top the house it must
be the fortuneteller's tom whispered to jerry the old
impostor which the plate represents was imjiiig out the
cards as she termed it to tell the fortunes sue and
kate but it appears she possessed no knowledge whatever her
own fortune when she was apprehended by the police
life in london
officers and afterwards tried at the sessions house clerken
well green and sentenced to six months imprisonment 
the above punishment that was in store for the old hag her
cards were so unkind to their mistress as never to give the
least hint this circumstance alone respecting the ignorance 
fortunetellers speaks volumes to the unwary but such
is the credulity mankind that nothing can allay the thirst
for a peep into futurity kate and sue had fallen into
between thirty and forty years since a woman the name 
coebtn resided in a very small house which she kept to herself next
door to the sign the bricklayers arms in king's gate street lowborn
who at that period and for several years afterwards was in high repute
as a fortuneteller or cunning woman from her printed handbills
which she had well circulated in the areas houses belonging to noblemen
and other persons rank at the west the town and iu
various parts the metropolis in order to decoy the women and menservants
to have their fortunes told also that they might put these bills
into the hands the daughters their masters in which she set forth
that she could give satisfactory answers to all questions respecting
persons at a distance either upon the sea or land cast the nativities 
individuals resolve difficult points c this bill had the desired
effect and mrs cokbtn carried on a roaring trade she was an extremely
ignorant woman but really a cunning one so far as to cheat those persons
who came to see her out their money and although she could not
read a yet she could converse with the planets fluently neither had
mrs cokbtn the slightest knowledge arithmetic but she was quite
expert or pretended to be so in calculating nativities she however was
a bold confident woman and well knew the method working upon the
credulity the female sex in particular mrs cokbtn was no stranger to
the impression made upon the mind by stage effect and therefore the
room which individuals were ushered into by her servant was so darkened
as to produce a solemn and appalling appearance upon the stranger who
in general was left alone for about a minute the walls were covered with
the sun moon stars c painted in black for the visitor to contemplate
this sort suspense had its importance when all a sudden out
popped the cunning woman dressed in a corresponding style and in an
kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
this error and tom and jerky thus traced them into the
old hag's apartment when the hearts the ladies were
beating pitapat to hear the important secrets their fate
assumed tone voice well calculated to excite fear in the breast a
female demanded to know the nature the inquiry if the lady wished
to be informed respecting persons at a distance then the cunning woman 
opened a large black full hieroglyphic characters which she pretended
to consult upon the subject and also pointed with her wand to
the stars uttering some incoherent expressions till she derived the
information to humbug the suitor but if it was about getting a husband
and in what time then the cards were laid out and by way a grand
climax if more money was advanced for mrs cokbyn had always an
excellent practice being paid first she offered to show any female the
exact kkeuess her future husband if the person acquiesced mrs
cobbyn bid her not to be frightened in order to increase the effect her
arts and immediately she drew aside a curtain which discovered a large
square clear glass behind which was a narrow passage parted off from
the room and a man whom she employed for the purpose as a confederate 
on mrs coebtn uttering a few cabalistic sounds totally unintelligible the
confederate would show his face and then vanish in an instant this
piece deception which was well managed operated so strongly upon
the feelings many her tender visitors that they have not only
screamed out with terror but several have actually fallen down in faintingfits
when any man wished to see his future wife she had also a confederate
female to play the part mrs coebtn increased so rapidly in
property that she was enabled to leave her obscure dwelling for a more
capacious respectable house which she had elegantly furnished in store
street tottenhamcourt road and where she carried on her deception in
high style laughing in her sleeve till she was ultimately routed by the
police an impostor a similar description also lived in the old bailey
under the denomination a cunning inch about the same period and
within the last fiveandtwenty years another hero this class dwelt in
the neighbourhood retinal green who was known by the appellation
 the straw man this fellow had little figures made straw which
in order to elude the pursuits justice it was his practice before he
opened his cunning lips to make his visitors purchase but at length
the man straw was tried and convicted as a rogue and a vagabond
 life in london
unfolded to them the plate sufficiently bespeaks the poverty
 the hag's garret an old rug answered the double purpose
 keeping out the cold and serving as a door through a hole
in which tom tickled sue with his whip in order to attract
her attention and accompanied it in a solemn disguised tone
with the words macbeth to the witches 
i conjure you by that which you profess
howe'er you come to know it answer me
though you untie the winds c
sue starting from her seat trembling at every joint exclaimed
 what shall we do my patience here is the
corinthian kate afraid to turn her head round to
meet the countenance our hero blushed and felt ashamed
on being caught in so ridiculous a situation but while tom
and jerry were laughing heartily at the confusion they had
made kate followed by her friend immediately ran downstairs
were in the street in an instant and walking off as fast
as possible towards their residence before the corinthian and
his coz had recovered themselves from this ludicrous scene
tom went in pursuit the fair ones leaving hawthorn
behind to compose the feelings the old hag who was in a
dreadful state agitation not only from the sudden interruption
which she had experienced but under the fear that our
and sentenced to six months imprisonment and for a second offence he
received the correction the house but thanks to the vigilance the
police most these barefaced impostors have been obliged to put down
their callings and it is now principally practised by u few gipsy
women who go about early in the morning under the pretence purchasing
clothes from the servant maids before their masters or mistresses
are up and who prevail on these thoughtless indiscreet girls to have their
fortunes told in order to get them off their guard that some their gang
may ia the interim rob the house
kate and sue visit a fortuneteller 
heroes were two officers justice in search her what 
said jerry smiling you a fortuneteller and your cards not
to tell you that you would have a great surprise before long 
oh dear no sir replied the old impostor my cards
never tell such things as them are but i hope you will have
some compassion and do not mean to take me before a justice
hawthorn convinced this cunning woman her error by
taking his departure and using all the speed he was able to
overtake his party jerry soon came up with them when
kate and sue on finding the laugh against them acknowledged
their error say no more about the old hag said
the corinthian and as she is now out your sight so let
the impostor be also out your mind i have got a fine treat
in store for you that will excite more astonishment and give
you more pleasure and satisfaction than fifty visits to all the
cunning women in the world but pray tell us what it is
that we may in some degree prepare ourselves for it replied
kate backed in the most persuasive manner by the lovely
sue is it a ball a masquerade a visit to the opera 
the theatre or you need not proceed any further
my dear creature with your questions said tom as it will
remain a profound secret with me till tomorrow morning
eleven o'clock when my coz and i will call for you and your
friend therefore as a favour i must request that you do not
keep us waiting a single instant as we are compelled to be at
the place by a specific time or we shall not be admitted
you are a cruel very cruel man exclaimed kate thus
to tantalise us indeed you are almost as bad as blue beard
with his blue chamber but nevertheless you may depend upon
our being ready to a minute sue likewise endeavoured
with all the playfulness she was mistress to obtain the
secret from hawthorn but the latter with a smile impressively
gazed on her sweet face squeezing her hand and with
 life in london
a theatrical sort dignity declaimed i must be crawl only
to be kind prior engagements on the part our heroes
compelled them to apologise for taking rather an abrupt leave
 the ladies for that evening but pledged themselves to pay
them an early visit the next morning
the corinthian and jerry accompanied by logic were
punctual to their appointment and kate and sue were
dressed long before the time waiting with the utmost anxiety
to receive them no delay now occurred and the gay
party were in the carriage and rattling through the streets
before the fair ones had scarcely time to inquire after the
nature the secret or the name the place they were about
to visit to carlton palace ladies replied tom and
if you do not on your return home au you say that it
eclipses every house you have previously witnessed in the
metropolis i will forfeit anything you may be pleased to
inflict upon me in thus highly raising your anticipation
indeed we will not let you off cried logic if we find
that you have imposed upon us and jerry shall be the judge
upon this occasion agreed observed the corinthian
the footman announced by his handy work at the knocker
that the party had arrived at carlton palace

the assumed gravity bob's mug upon playing off this trick
was quite a treat but i am happy to say rocky looked it
come gents said bob please yourselves here is plenty
 water now mix away it had the desired effect the
glass was pushed about so quickly that the first the

after the regulars had been tucked up in their dais and
only the rooster and the peepodayboys were out on the

for anything upon turning the corner sydncifs alley
into leicesterfields we were assailed by some troublesome
customers and a turnup was the result as the plate most
accurately represents bob got a tinker and poor i received
a chancerysuit upon the nol how i reached the upperstory
i know not but on waking late in the day i found my
pocketbook was absent without leave i was in great grief
at this loss not on account the blunt it contained much
worse the notes in it were dearer than gold to me the

bill dash c c on his first appearance in eotten row
with the corinthian booked on the spot i was in a complete
funk i immediately went to strain persons and communicated
my loss how where and when and i was consoled
that if it were safe pierce egan should have it day after
day passed and no account it i gave it up for lost and
scratched my foppery again and again but cotdd not recollect
 life in london
accurately the substance my notes i was sorry for myself j
i was sorry for the public however on friday morning
last taking a turn into paternoster eow my friend jones
smiling said lie had got the as he is fond a bit 
gig i thought he was in fun but on handing it over to me
with the following letter my peepers twinkled again with
delight
to the care mr jones for p egan
sir you see as how i have sent that are litter pocketbook
which so much row has been kicked up about amongst
us vy it an't worth a single tonics who s to understand
it vy it s full pothooks and hangers and not a screen 
in it you are determined nobody shall those your hears
if your name had not been haunted in it it would have been
dinged into the duncan but remember no conning
from yours c
dec tim hustle
the joy i felt on recovering my pocketbook i cannot
communicate but that is not all in my exertions to find
it i picked up a rich anecdote concerning another pocketbook
which amply compensates for the unpleasant feelings
i have experienced on the above occasion and which is now
given to the public but in all probability had it not been
 literary a halfpenny shorthand
one pound note an author indeed with money in his pocketbook
would be a novelty in life in london but in the north they are not
quite so scott free in this respect merit is at all times worthy 
reward

termed on the right way the name no no no no nonne

 and therefore it is most certainly an an ill wind

on an opera night crossed lord as he was making towards his
carriage and with great dexterity drawer the peek his pocket 
immediately put the best leg foremost and arrived out breath at
his penny almost before you could say jack robinson but ou
examining the to his great disappointment it only contained a few
trifling memorandums it was however such a beautiful piece workmanship
that instead destroying it his usual precaution he threw
the pocket over to his hen saying poll my dear it is a pretty
article and you may keep it for your own use i feel rather tired i
shal therefore do no more word to night but go to bed the fora
short time was thrown aside but poll's curiosity womanlike induced
her again to examine it when to her great joy and surprise she found a
secret pocket containing in new bank notes poll in her eagerness
to communicate this good luck to her flash man who was now asleep on
the dab almost fell over the chairs exclaiming and giving him a shako
at the same time you are a pretty cove an't you to nap a

tom jerry on their p's tst q's at almack's s's
an opportunity presented itself to our trio to visit the
condemned yard in newgate it was a mournful sight
logic observed to the corinthian but as it was the
intention jerry not to neglect visiting any place that might
afford him information during his stay in london he had been
induced to make the proposition to hawthorn yet he was
free to confess it was more especially on his own account ashe
was compelled to attend and companions would therefore
prove very agreeable to his feelings upon such a melancholy
occasion we will accompany you bob replied tom and
jerry
the plate represents the morning execution and the
malefactors having their irons knocked off previous to their
ascending the fatal platform that launches them into eternity
the yeoman the halter is in waiting to put the ropes about
them the clergyman is also seen administering consolation
to these unfortunate persons in such an awful moment j and
the sheriffs are likewise in attendance to conduct the culprits
to the place execution to perform the most painful part 
their duty in witnessing the offended laws their country put
in force it is a truly afflicting scene and neither the pen nor
the pencil however directed by talent can do it adequate
justice or convey a description the harrowed feelings 
the few spectators that are admitted into the condemned yard
upon such an occasion the tolling the bell too which
breaks in upon the very soul the already agonized malefactor
announcing to him that he has but a few minutes to
live adds a terrific solemnity to the proceedings 
hear it not duncan for tis a knell
that summons thee to heav'n or to hell
the condemned yard is long but narrow and contains a
great number cells one above another forming three
 life in london
stories in height each cell measures nine feet in length
and six in width every indulgence is allowed to those
prisoners immediately the dealerwarrant arrives at newgate
ordering them to prepare for execution they are then
allowed to remain in the large eoom which the plate
represents in order that the clergyman may attend upon
them as often as they desire it and who generally previous
to the morning on which they are to suffer sits up praying
with them the whole the night it is really astonishing
upon most these occasions to witness the resignation and
fortitude with which these unhappy men conduct themselves 
many the most hardened and desperate offenders from the
kindness attention and soothing conduct the rev mr
cotton who is indefatigable in administering consolation to
their troubled minds have become the most sincere penitents 
nay more several prisoners who have received a free pardon
after having been ordered for execution have since publicly
declared that they should never again bo in such a fit state
to meet eternity the criminal on the left side the plate
lifting up his hands in the attitude prayer with the clergyman
was once a character considerable note at the west
 the town and from his vivacity then designated
lively jem he soon ran through a fine fortune and to
keep up his extravagances he plunged into those destructive
habits which ultimately brought him into this ignominious
situation lively jem like most others saw his error too
late to repair it he had not strength mind sufficient to
bear with the reverses fortune to fall from splendour to
poverty was too much for his feelings and to avoid the jests
and sneers his once dashing acquaintance under the appellation
 poor fellow and being excluded from their company
he thus violently terminated his thoughtless career

 jerry on their p's a q s at almack's 
a sort contempt said he is the completest dandy i
ever saw i think logic called him an exquisite he
appears to me to be neither a man nor a woman such a
thing would be no use in somersetshire and i imagine
 none either in the great or little world in the metropolis
except as a mark for ridicule to shoot at stop my
dear jerry said tom with a suppressed laugh remember
lethe 
the corinthian and jerry were soon in the presence 
the marchioness who received them in the most welcome
manner and also congratulated hawthorn upon seeing him
at almack's at the same time introducing our heroes to
the two misses trifle the cousins the exquisite we
can make up a party for a quadrille said the marchioness
to the corinthian with a most gracious smile certainly
madam replied tom and if you will permit me to offer
my hand to the eldest miss trifle and to recommend my
coz as a partner for her sister i shall consider it as a high
honour conferred upon us it was immediately agreed to 
and our heroes were enabled to join the dance without the
assistance the explanatory card the appearance the
marchioness was so brilliant from her display diamonds
that jerry was nearly in want the word lethe to call
off his attracted eyes to his lovely partner that stood before
him the hon dick trifle formed one the quadrille as
the plate represents but his female cousins had nothing
trifling attached to them excepting their name indeed on
the contrary they were superior girls handsome in their persons
and interesting in their manners and jerry felt quite
pleased that he had been so fortunate as to procure such an
agreeable lady for his partner but the dance had scarcely
commenced when hawthorn perceived among the pros
 life in london
menaces his fair incognita at the masquerade last
wanton the hitherto attractions his partner were all
forgotten in an instant he was on the frd and almost determined
to pursue her so strongly did he feel the impulse 
the moment but his p's and q's had now returned to their
duty and whispered to him it would be highly improper to
do so goodbreeding forbade it and the respect and attention
which were due to his partner required him to keep his
station if he wished to support the character a gentleman
poor jerry now indeed felt the want the card to point out
to him the figure the dance as his eyes instead being
fixed on his partner were directed to the spot where lady
wanton was walking the face the latter heroine on
suddenly encountering our hero was a crimson hue and
instantly in a confused state she obscured herself in the
thickest part the promenaders and was soon lost sight 
by hawthorn upon the conclusion the dance our hero
by way an excuse complained a slight sprain which he
had met with in his ankle and in consequence excused himself
from waltzing with miss trifle being the best apology
he could under such circumstances make to his lovely and
engaging partner to prevent detection jerry was compelled
to sit down though he would have taken to his heels if he
could have done so without observation and his eyes were
wandering over the assembly in hopes obtaining another
glimpse the lady in question but the bird had flown he
had not marked it down as heretofore and although as keen
a sportsman as ever entered a field he was liege completely at
fault almack's had now lost its charms owing to this
disappointment it was a mere desert to him hawthorn
was intent upon another subject and many great personages
who were well worthy his attention were passed over with
the utmost indifference the corinthian was equally in the
