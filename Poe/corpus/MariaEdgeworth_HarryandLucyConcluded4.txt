were left alone in the workshopharry whirring happily at the lathe he felt lucy suddenly touch his arm and saw her looking up in his face as if eagerto say something rather reluctantly heslackened the whirring motion and heldback the toolwell what do you want my dear want you to come with me i havemade a discovery follow me harryharry laid down his tool and followedthe workshop was a large irregularroom surrounded by shelves and drawersvol iv band racks for tools with various benches forcarpenters and carvers and for braziers andsmiths three lathes were placed obliquelyto the windows in the middle of the roomstood a circular saw machine a lapidary'swheel and a treadle blowpipe and therewere two flagged recesses partly screenedoff and contrived for a camp forge and asmall casting furnace there was anotherrecess elevated two or three steps abovethe floor which contained some tall modelsand behind these lucy had discovereda door which being unlatched shehad pushed a little more open and nowthrowing it quite back she said lookharry at what is in that room helooked in and his eyes sparkled with joyan electrical machine a great battery but with his foot on the threshold hestopped and laying his hand on her armsaid do not go in i do not know whetherwe may i hope you have not been inthere oh no said lucy m would notwithout asking youand i must not without asking sirrupert but lucy when you first sawthis what did you think it was oh i knew directly that it was anelectrical machine said lucyyou never saw one before that i knowof said harry i saw my uncle's butyou did not it has been packed up eversince you came home from aunt pierrepoint'svery true but i have seen a print ofone with electrical machine written underneath and i knew it directly from that but i do not understand any thing about itas you saw my uncle's real machine youcan explain this to me we need not goin harry but just as we stand here youmight show me the use of all the parts firsttell me the use of that glass cylinder whichis something like a broad grindstone ofglass with a sort of a silk curtain hangingover it and a long windlass handle andi see a chain andb yes yes interrupted harry you seea great deal of which i cannot explain toyou the usewhy not said lucy you had better ask my father or sirrupert said harryso i will then said lucy for i amexceedingly curious about electricity iwant to know all about the electrical kiteand the leyden phial and conductors andnonconductors and electrics and nonelectricand electrics per semy dear lucy cried harry howcomes it that you know all these nameswhich you rattle off so finely i thought i should surprise you saidlucy laughingi do not remember my father everhaving talked of them to you said anyand i am sure i never didno you never did but i heard themat aunt pierrepoinfs and i will tell youhow it happened it all began from a bitof wit one day when there were a greatmany visitors they were talking of a ladywho was very delicate very nervousaunt pierrepoint advised her to try electricityand a gentleman said he wouldanswer for it that the ley den phial woulddo her more good than any other phial inthe world my aunt smiled and everybodysmiled and said he was wittywhen the company had gone away iasked my aunt what he meant she saidonly a jeu de mot child a pun iasked what the leyden phial was shesaid it was rather a glass jar than a phialand that electrical people with their machinescontrived to fill or charge thesejars with electricity i asked what electricitywas but she had not time to tellme any more then she was in a greathurry dressinga few days afterwards some of the samepeople came again and i heard that thenervous lady had received two or threeshocks and was wonderfully better wasquite set up again and that electricityhad cured some old duke of a palsy in hisarm he had lost the use of it but afterone shock he could carry his glass to hismouth then every body said electricitywas a wonderfully charming thing but theweek afterwards i heard that it was all amistake that the duke's arm had fallenback again and that the nervous lady wasas low as ever then they talked of peoplethat had been knocked down and a professorsomebody that had been killed formerlyby electricity and an old lady said thereshould have been an act of parliamentagainst it from the first then they talkedof an electrical kite and conductors andlightning i asked aunt pierrepoint againafterwards what was meant by an electricalkite and conductors she told me thatthey were talking of the great dr franklin'skite that he was a wonderful manand had a wonderful kite which broughtlightning down from the clouds and thathe was the inventor of conductors forhouses and churches and people in thunderstorms but she said she could notexplain more to me without being a professorof electricity which she did notpretend to be now harry as you saythat you saw my uncle's electrical machinewhen i was away you can explain it allto me i am afraid not said harry myuncle showed me several entertainingexperiments and i found in the closetwithin my room a most entertaining bookon electricity which i once sat up readingat night till my candle was burnedout there was an account of otto garrick'smaking and whirling a sulphur globeand seeing for the first time sparks andflashes of light come from it in the darkthen i got to the leyden jar and the firstelectrical shock and franklin's sendingup his kite in the thunder storm i wasexceedingly happy that night but i believemy head was as much puzzled asyours was at aunt pierrepoint's in themorning when my mother found i hadbeen up half the night she was notpleased and she made me promise not todo so again and i never did i only gotup as early as possible in the morning andat every spare minute i was at the book inthe closet it was a great thick quartomy father however stopped me before ihad got half through it he said it wasnot fit for me and it is true i did notunderstand half a quarter of it the buti think i could iioic and i wish i couldsee it aoamj but harry why did you never tell meall this before asked lucy and whydid you never mention to me the electricalmachine or leyden jar or even electricityi had my own reasons said harryone was that you had not come up toelectricity before we began our journey and indeed i was afraid of puzzling youbecause i had been puzzled myself ithought too that my father could tell youbetter whenever he pleased besides iwas not clear that he would like my goingbackto electricity then but i dare say i mean i hope he will have no objection tostit now and that sir rupert will show ussome experiments with this machine iwill go and ask my father what he thinksabout its concluded anylet us go directly then said lucy and while you are asking papa i will asksir rupert if he will at least give me anelectric shockno no first let us be sure of my fatherssaid harry i am sure he can have no objectionsaid lucy but when they asked him aboutit lucy observed that though he seemedunwilling to refuse their request yet helooked somewhat sorry that it had beenmade she did not know why howeveras to the essential point he made noobjection to her having a shock and seeingthe electric spark he approved of theirseeing some of the experiments mentionedin scientific dialogues such as thatof thepith balls and of the poker and that forwhich harry specially pleaded as he wassure it would divert lucy the experimentof the dancing paper figures inb short their father said that he could notobject to their seeing any electrical experimentswhich their friend sir rupertmight think proper to show them hecould trust safely to his judgment in thisand in every thing that concerned harryto him they next wentthey found him in the library settledin his armchair reading and looking socomfortable that they did not like to disturbhim he was indeed very happylooking over a new pamphlet that interestedhim particularly an account of thelate m guinand and of the improvementsmade by him in the manufacture of flintglassfor large telescopes harry and lucyhesitating went up to his chair one toeach elbow and stood still looking behindhim at each other they had a mind toretreat without making known their requestbut he looked up and smilingkindly asked what they wanted theytold him and when he found that notwithstandingtheir great desire to see theelectrical machine they had not been fartherthan the threshold of the room hehalf rose from his chair but sitting downagain said i must finish this passagefirst you may read it over my shoulderif you will cannot leave the story inthis note half toldwhile making this glass m guinandnever permitted any persons to be presentexcept his wife and son who assisted himon these occasions they were generallysecluded for many days and nights in hislittle laboratory but when he had completedthe operation if the result wasfavourable his friends and neighbours wereadmitted and partook of some refreshmentwhile offering their congratulationsa year or two before his death mguinand tried an experiment on a largerscale than he had previously attemptedafter much exertion he had succeeded inproducing a perfect objectglass of eighteeninches diameter this glass had been putinto the oven for the last time in order tobe gradually cooled and the operationbeing now considered as completed thefriends were as usual admitted in themidst of their congratulations on this unprecedentedsuccess after an unusuallylong seclusion the fire by some accidentcaught the roof of the building on thisalarming occasion all present exerted themselves and after some trouble the flameswere extinguished but not before somewater had found its way into the oven anddestroyed its precious contents ah poor m guinand cried lucyi hope he was more successful thenext time said harryhe was nearly eighty years oldharry said sir rupert and the discouragementcaused by this misfortune andthe great expense of those experimentsprevented his attempting any more on asimilar scale before he died i shouldhave told you that he was a poor watchmakerin a country village in switzerlandand that neither artists nor philosophershave ever succeeded in making glass equalto hissir rupert laid down the book with theair of a man who makes but is willing tomake some sacrifice and he attended hisyoung friends to the electrical machinesas lucy called it she watchedevery thiner that was done harry wentto the handle of the slabs cylinder andwas going to turn it but sir rupert stoppedhim as he said that he had something toshow lucy first he took up a glass tubeand rubbed it with his silk handkerchiefthen holdings it to harry's head lucy sawthe hair rise up and bend towards it anda feather on the table jumped up andhung to it as sir rupert held the olasstube near it just like what i have seen harry dowith the glass stopper of the decanter afterdinner said lucy and i have seenthe same with a stick of sealingwax afterit has been rubbed on a coat sleeve andi remember long ago when we werelittle children that we used to play withan amber eoor of mamma's and thatlittle bits of paper and feathers stuck to itjust sotrue said sir rupert this propertyof attracting light bodies was observedin amber hundreds of years agoby the ancients the latin name foramber which is derived from the greekis electrum thence our word electric andelectricity all that was originally knownabout it to the ancients was this power ofattracting light bodies remember i sayattracting lucy did you observe anythingmore when you amused yourself withyour amber qggj and the bits of paper andfeathers yes said lucy we saw that after atime they would jump no more they stoodquite still or they jumped back i recollectdo not you harry that they jumpedforward and backward alternately that is said sir rupert that theywere alternately attracted and repdltd iam glad that you observed and have rememberedthat you will now understandwhat i mean by the repellent as well asthe attractive power of amber but thisrepellent power was never observed by theancients nor known to the modes tillabout a hundred and fifty years ago whenit was thought a great discoverylucy expressed some surprise that thishad never been observed till so latelysir rupert smiled and said there is moreto be seen and known about amber withwhich perhaps you are not yet yourselfacquainted did you ever see sparks oraflash of light come from amber after ithas been rubbed or did you ever hear alittle crackling noise from itnever sir said lucynor was it likely that you shouldsaid sir rupert because your amberegg probably was not a sufficiently largepiece of that substance to produce theeffect but sparks have been seen froma large smooth piece of amber and thisobservation created much surprise whenfirst it was made which was about thesame time when its repellent power wasas i told you discovered then thesame properties were observed in jet sulphurresin and glass and still the sameword the same name electricity was usedto express the supposed cause of all theseproperties in whatever substance they werefound to those substances in whichafter using friction these properties appearedpeople gave the name of electricsand to those from which they could notbe obtained by any degree of rubbing theygave the name o nonelectrics ambersealingwax and glass for instance arecalled electrics this table and the pokerfor example which you might rub withyour hand for ever without making themattract light bodies and without obtainingfrom them any sparks are called nonelectricbut take care lucy that thisname of nonelectrics does not misleadyou into taking it for granted that in nonelectricthere is no electricity when wecome to your brother's favourite experimentsi shall show you that the electricspark can be obtained from the poker byother means experiments tried by variouspeople at different times in afferent countrieswithin the last sixty years haveascertained that not only in the poker andin the table but in every substance innature with which we are acquaintedsolid or fluid vegetable animal or mineralin earth air and water electricity isto be found though in various proportions and to be obtained or made apparent toour senses by different means rememberthen that electrics is only the namegiven to those bodies from which electricitycannot be had by friction andwhen i use the word electricity i meanthe supposed cause of the electrical propertiesof bodies i must however observethat as yet we are imperfectly acquaintedwith this science and of what isknown i know but a small part and ofthat i can explain very little to you howeversome of the principal facts i can tellyou and some of the principal phenomenaor appearances i can show you in thefirst place before i say any more we weillshow you some electric sparks and youshall have an electric shock which youare so curious to feel turn the handle ofthe glass cylinder harryas he worked it sir rupert showedlucy that the glass cylinder as it revolvedrubbed against a cushion which was fixedso as to press hard against it this cushionhe told her is called the rubber insteadof rubbing with the silk handkerchiefas you saw me rub the glass tube frictionis in this manner more conveniently producedwhen this had been done sufficientlyharry held his knuckles to a brass knob atthe end of a tin cylinder belonging to themachine and which sir rupert told themwas a conductor immediately lucy hearda slight crackling noise and saw sparkscome either from the brass to harry'sknuckles or from harry's knuckles to thebrass she did not know which they passedso quickly she followed his example and holding her knuckles to the brass knobfelt with some surprise the tingling sensationproduced by the electric spark sirrupert now told her to stand upon a littlewooden stool with thick glass legs whichhe set on the floor near the machine hedesired her to hold a chain the other endof which was fastened to the conductorafter the handle of the glass cylinder hadbeen again turned sufficiently he toldlucy to give her hand to harry sheexclaimed that she felt the same tinglingsensation she had perceived before ontouching the knob from the conductoryes said sir rupert you actedthe part of a conductor and harry receivedan electric spark from youhe now told her to get off the stool and said that he would give her an electricshock if she pleased but warned her thatperhaps she might not like itthen give me only a little shock sirif you please a very little shock my dearsir pray sir rupert promised that it should bevery slight he desired her to hold in herlefthand a chain that touched the outsideof a glass jar which sir rupert told herwas a leyden phial he put into herrighthand a bit of brass wire withwhich he told her to touch the brassknob fixed on the top of the jar she didso and at that instant she felt a shockslight as it was it made lucy start violentlyat first she thought harry hadgiven her a blow on the elbow thenholding her elbow fast she said that hercuriosity was satisfied and that if thiswas the famous electrical shock she neverdesired to feel it aoainharry could not help laughing a littleat her start and surprise which seemed tohim so much greater than the occasiondeserved recovering lucy began tolook a little ashamed sir rupert observedfor her comfort that great philosophershad been not a little frightened whenfirst they felt the electric shockphilosophers sir said harry howdid they show that they were frightenedby the strangely exaggerated accountsthey gave of their sensations one gentlemanafter his first shock wrote to a friendthat he felt himself so struck in his armsbreast and shoulders that he lost hisbreath that he was two days before herecovered from the effects of the blow andthe terror and that he would not take asecond shock for the kingdom of franceanother after trying the shock from theleyden phial said his whole body hadbeen affected with convulsions and thathe felt as if a heavy stone lay upon hisheadlucy hoped it would be rememberedthat her little start and first fright had allbeen over in a minute or less instead oflasting two days harry but i supposeadded she that their shocks must havebeen much greater than minesir rupert said that the shocks theyreceived could not have been much moreviolent than what she had feltharry asked how he could be sure ofthat sir rupert answered that as theyhad described the apparatus they used anestimate could be formed of the utmostpower of the shock which they could possiblyhave received they used only asmall glass bowl said he and notcoated as the ley den phial is now theyhad no electrical battery nor any meansby which they could give a powerfulshocklucy observed that harry was perfectlysatisfied by this answer therefore she wassure that he understood it but for herpart she did not in the least comprehendwhat sir rupert meant she was verydesirous to know more but so many questionsoccurred to her that she could scarcelytell which to ask first she wished toknow why she had been made to standupon a stool when she gave harry theelectric sparks or why the stool unlikeall others had legs of glass she wishedto know what was the cause of her receivinga shock from touching the knob onthe leyden jar with the wire but herfirst question was to sir rupert's surprise has this electric shock been really ofany use to sick people or to men or womenin palsies sir rupert said lie did not know ithad at first been thought to be of medicalservice and it was said to have restoredpersons to the use of their limbs butafterwards this had been doubted andthe apparent or transient advantage wasascribed to the effect on the imaginationso far lucy had not obtained much moreactual knowledge than she had had before but the diffidence with which sir rupertspoke gave her an idea of the gi'eat cautionand modesty of real philosophers'speech sounlike the rash assertions of halfinformedpersons or of conceited pretenders tosciencein compliance with harry's request sirrupert next showed lucy some of the firstexperiments which harry had seen at hisuncle's which need not be detailed hereas an exact description of the experimento the pith bails and of the pokei and ofthe dancing paper figures may be found inscientific dialogues illustrating the natureof electric attraction and repulsion lucywas amused with these experiments butflshe could not take in all the explanations she became a little confused and puzzledabout conductors and nonconductorswhich having candidly confessed sir rupertadvised her to stop assuring her thathe would at another time when her mindshould be rested and refreshed return tothe subject and promising that he wouldreward her candour by doing his best tomake it clear to her which he added hedid not doubt but he should be able toaccomplish if she would not either despairor be in a hurry if she would onlyhave patience with herself and with himand allow to both sufficient time andnow said he i shall be glad to returnto my pamphlet and you and your brotherwill be glad i think to take a good runor a walk suppose we take the walklady digby was talking of across thefields through copsewood and over theford to farmer dobson's ah ha youlike that i never knew young people thatdid not prefer a difficult to an easy iwill not say a dirty to a clean walk well by the time bonnets and hats and walkingshoes are on and papa and mamma andlady digby and all assembled in the hallready for a march i have a notion i shallhave done my pamphlet and be with youtoothis walk was as rambling and asscrambling with as many hedges andditches to get over and as many badpasses and unstable stepping stones tocross as hearts of youth could desire orlegs of age accomplishfarmer dobson the snuggest of yeomenand the best of tenants met the party athis outermost gate with a warm welcomefor his landlord and his landlord's friendswhomsoever they might be his eyebrightened when he saw young folks he had a power of his own thank godfor them he said as he opened wide thehouse door he loved young folks headded and requested that they would allvol iv cbe so agreeable as to come in and restthemselves after their long walkafter they had sat for some minutes andafter orchard and poultryyard and farmyardhad been all duly visited and that itwas time to think of returning home harry'sand lucy's satisfaction was completed bythe farmer's assuring them that if theyhad any disliking to go back the sameroad they came they might return quite anew way by passing through sophaturnstile and higglesham pike down thefields of reddeer manor and so gettingby the short cut straight up the back wayto the castleharry listened most attentively to thesedirections but as he did not know anyoneof the places named it might havebeen even dinner time before they reacheddigby castle had he persisted in acting asavantcourier but he gave up the pointat higglesham pike whence under thestraight forward guidance of sir rupert'scane they reached home by the usualhour for luncheonsir rupert looked at his watch andfinding that he had ample time sat downto write some letters telling harry andlucy that when the clock should strikenext he would be ready for them at theelectrical machinepunctual as the clock harry and lucywere opposite to the electrical machine and sir rupert equally punctual shut thedoor after him ere the clock had donestrikinglucy my dear said sir ruperti hope you have put out of your headwhatever it was that puzzled you aboutconductors the name of conductors isgiven to all substances which conduct electricityfrom one body to another thosewhich will not do this we call nonconductorsis this clear to youquite clear said lucy do notknow what puzzled me before but i believeit was that nonconductors are alsosometimes called electricsyes it has been found that all originallyc electric substances are also nonconductorsof electrics and conductors lists have beenmade and you may look at them at yourleisure it is enough for our present purposeto tell you that earth and water areconductors and so are all the metals metallic conductors are the best thisbrass chain is one so is that iron rod andso is this tin tubelucy saw and understood this and nowhoped they might go on to the leyden jarmy dear lucy said sir rupertyour brother tells me you are fond offrench proverbs did you ever hear ii fautreculer pour mieux sauter i must thereforego back if you please to the reign ofcharles the second where i left off justbefore harry persuaded me to show youthe experiment of the poker many ofthe members of the royal society whichwas at that time first established were atwork on electrical experiments amongothers was a philosopher with whose nameyou are perhaps acquainted boylelucy asked harry if this was his boylethe great vacuumman yes answered harryhe was one of the first persons whohad a glimpse of electric light continuedsir rupert which he first saw from adiamonda diamond sir said lucy ithought you told us it was first seen inamber i said it was seen in amber but i didnot tell you it was first seen in ambersaid sir rupert i should not have mentionedthat out of its order in point oftime boyle is supposed to have been oneof the first discoverers of electric liohthe noticed it as he was rubbing diamondin the darkbut was boyle the first person whomade this discovery said harry doubtinglyperhaps said sir rupert smilingyou claim the honour of it for the childrenin the arabian tale who wakenedtheir mother by quarrelling for the diamondthat gave light in the darkharry and lucy both smiledbut seriously sir said harry didnot otto garrick see sparks and flashesfrom his whirling globe of sulphursparks and flashes he certainly sawfrom his sulphur globe but whether beforeboyle saw the flash from his diamondis to this hour a disputed point and iadvise our avoiding all disputesi am glad of it said lucy theyhinder one from getting onbut said harry i thought it wasbut justice to settle this and to give boylethe honour of the discovery if it was reallyhis especially as i love otto so muchvery right my honourable friendsaid sir rupert preserve that spirit ofjustice all your life but for the presentconsider that if we were to attempt tosettle all the disputes about priority ofdiscoveries in electricity we might standhere all daw and be found in the dark atlast now let us go on and keep safe inthe use of the impersonal pronoun it itwas discovered i assure you harry am willing to give all due honour to yourfavourite otto garrick for the ingenuityof his whirling globe of sulphur to excitefriction by means of which he made thegreat discovery of electric repulsion butharry it is remarkable that he missedanother discovery which was absolutelyunder his hand under his hand what how sir vcried harry you recollect or you forget perhaps'continued sir rupert how he made higlobe he melted the sulphur in a hollowglobe of glass and then broke the glass toget out his sulphur ball little imaginingthat the glass which he broke and threwaway was a more highly electric substanceand would have answered his purposebetter than that upon which he wasintent that is curious but he could nottell that beforehand said harry no but he might have tried he neednot have taken it for granted that glass isnot electricharry asked if sir isaac newton wholived at the same time as boyle and wasone of the early members of the royalsociety had made any discovery in electricityyes said sir rupert he made oneand but one discovery of importance ashewas rubbing a glass lens he observedthat it became electric on the side of theglass opposite to that on which it wasrubbed this circumstance i did notmention to you because i cannot explainits consequence without entering into explanationsthat would not suit you at presentwe will go on where we wereafter the flashes of light from the sulphurglobe there was darkness on the subject ofelectricity for some time public curiositywhich had been suddenly excited as suddenlygrew tired and fell asleep in englandfrom the reign of charles the secondtill the reign of queen anne when it wasfirst wakened i think by mr hawksbeewho set to work by whirling a globe ofglass he also provided himself with aglobe of sulphur and one of sealingwaxinclosing another of wood and he had afourth made of rosin with all these he triedexperiments the chief result of which wasthe discovery that of all known substancesglass is the most electric this proved of thegreatest convenience as well as importanceto science as glass can be so easily mouldedand blown into different forms it was bestadapted to the use of every experimenterand from that time became the principalpart of every electrical apparatus in theform of tubes globes cylinders and circularplatesstill philosophers were as much puzzledabout conductors and nonconductors asyou were this morning lucy it wasonly by experiments that they were enabledto settle which were which and manywere tried at this period by two friendsmr wheeler and mr gray who in concjunction with one another laboured toascertain how far they could communicateelectricity to what height and to whatdistance from balconies they let downlong hollow canes and in great barns theystretched wooden rods and strings of packthreadsometimes supported by others ofsilk with considerable difficulty theyconveyed electricity by these lines ofcommunication about seven hundred feetbut they were as it seemed still much indoubt which substances served their purposesand which did not besides theirimperfect knowledge of conductors anotherdifficulty occurred they found thatthe electricity which they communicatedto bodies or which existed in electricswas dissipated after a short time it wasdiscovered that these bodies parted withtheir electricity to other surrounding objects to the earth and to the air theyperceived that their labour must be vainif as fast as they poured the electric fluidinto the substances on which they weretrying experiments it was lost before theyaccomplished their object of conveying it toa distancesome new contrivances were requiredto counteract and remedy this inconveniencethey separated as well as theycould the substances on which they wereoperating from all others and hung themfrom lines of dry cotton and silk findingthat these were not conductors someof their experiments were tried uponliving creatures they suspended a childby silken lines and tried to communicateelectricity to him they electrified iijinas you were electrified this morning whilestanding on the glasslegged stool andonly felt the tingling sensation you describedbut the electric shock had neveryet been felt and though sparks had beencommunicated to the human body no oneat this time suspected that electricityexisted in itpublic attention in england was fixedupon these experiments by the lectures ofone whose name harry i think youknow a great mechanic dr defaultersbut it was in france that electricitynow became particularly popularthis was in the reign of louis the fifteenthwho was contemporary you knowwith our george the second the abbecolet a very ingenious and celebratedman began by repeating the english experimentsalong with his friend m dufay whose name is less known i cannottell why by using wet packthread fortheir line of communication they succeededin conducting electricity along thewalks of a garden above a thousand yardswhich was then considered wonderfulat a famous experiment however exhibitedat shooter's hill it has since beenconveyed above four miles i should nothave told you this out of due order butfor the honour of old england harry icould not resist i beg the abbe nollet'spardon he succeeded as i told you incommunicating electricity above a thousandyards by means of a line of wetpackthread the general observation hadlong been made by gray and others thatmoisture assisted in the communication ofelectricity yet it had never occurred tothem that water was a conductor now itwas ascertained that water is a good conductorthe abbe nollet and his friend m dufay repeated gray's experiment of suspendingliving creatures by lines of silkand setting them on cakes of rosin orstools of glass as nonconductors for thepurpose of preventing the electricity communicatedto them from beings carried downto the earth this was called insulatingthem placing them as it were in anisland m du fay had himself suspendedin lines of silk and electrified and delightedhe was but infinitely more sowhen to his surprise he saw what noone had ever before seen a spark of electricfire drawn from the human bodythe abbe nollet declared he never couldforget the astonishment he felt when firsthe saw a spark of electric fire come froma human creaturethis experiment and others uponelectric attraction and repulsion were immediatelyrepeated before the french academyof sciences curiosity was raised amongall ranks in paris and crowds of peopleflocked to see them exhibited as it hadbeen discovered that electricity could beconveyed from one person as well as fromone inanimate substance to another peoplestood hand in hand in circles to be electrifiedand the novelty and surprise of theeffect were entertaining to alldid they feel a shock such as i hadthis morning asked lucy no not a shock said sir rupert only that slighter sensation which wasattended by the snapping noise that youheard when the sparks came from yourhand to the brass knob and from the brassknob to your hand as to the electricshock that was not learnt till the discoveryof the ley den phial but the abbecolet's experiments were sufficiently wonderfulat that time to produce general admirationfranklin was then as well as irecollect at paris and saw nobles experimentswhen he returned to americahis powerful mind set to work on the subjectwith all the requisites that couldpromise i might almost say humanlyspeakingensure success acute observationindefatigable patience and great cautionin trying experiments with the habitsof close reasoning and active inventionbut i must not let enthusiasm for franklindraw me out of my course it is not yettime to follow him to the country of whichhe is the glory first justice calls me toholland now lucy we come to theleyden jar but for one moment more letme try your patience it is very difficult tobe patient i know when just in sight ofyour objectlucy's eye glanced at the tray full ofjars which she saw near the electricalmachine before her but she forbore to askany question she stood an edifying exampleof patience and the admiration ofharryi must say a word or two to youmy patient lucy continued sir rupertabout this electrical machine you donot imagine that it came into the world asyou now see it ready armed with conductorsand provided with all that couldfit it for the service of electrical philosophersfar from it this machine suchas you now see it is the result of the combinedobservation ingenuity and labourof a succession of philosophers who havebeen at work for above one hundred andfifty years trying experiments on electricity and in fact this machine containsthe evidence and register of their progresswhen the name and the knowledge of electricitywas confined to one substance noapparatus was necessary the man rubbedhis piece of amber with his hand or onthe sleeve of his coat and his businesswas done with this he could see andshow all the wonders of which he knewthe existence but when knowledge increasedand when the lists of electricsubstances and of conductors swelled andlenotenet when experiments were to betried with globes of glass and conductorsof metal with balls and points and linesof silk all these things were by degreesarranged into the form you see a cylinderof glass is used in this machine insteadof a globe it is found that thisshape is preferable lucy do you nowperceive the use of the glass legs to thestool on which we placed you when youwere electrified and when you gave a sparkto harry lucy said she thought that they were toprevent the electricity from being carrieddown to the earth glass being a nonconductorshe supposed that she was putupon it for the same reason that the manorboy to be electrified was set upon thecake of rosinyou reward me for my pains saidsir rupert or rather you complete mypleasure in teaching you lucy for youshow me that you have been attendingand that you have perfectly understood allthat i have been sayingharry looked far prouder than if praisedhimselfnow i hope the leyden jar will notdisappoint you after all continued sirrupert it was so called simply becauseit was invented at ley den and bymeans of a phial or small bottle its propertieswere discovered by a dutchman ofthe name of muschenbroek about eightyyears ago and in this manner havingobserved like all those who had tried experimentson the subject that electrifiedbodies when exposed to the atmospheresoon lose their electricity and were capableof retaining but a small portion hedetermined to try whether he could notprevent this loss and whether he couldaccumulate a greater quantity by surroundingthe substance to which electricitywas to be communicated by some nonconductorinstead of suspending it in the airas formerly by silk lines or supporting itupon rosin or glass the experimentcould be simply tried with water and glass he chose water as being a powerful conductorand glass as it is the most perfectelectric and nonconductor electricitywas to be communicated from a metalconductor to the water in a glass phialwhen the water had received as muchelectricity as it was supposed that it couldcontain the person who had the phial inone hand was going with his other handto disengage an iron wire which communicatedfrom the water to the principalconductor but the moment he touchedthat wire he was surprised by a suddenshock in his arms and breast the firstever felt from any electric machine and ofwhich such exaggerated descriptions weregiven as i repeated to you this morningbut how did it happen said harry what was the cause of the shocksir ithat said sir rupert i dare noteven attempt to explain to you you mustbe contented at present with the simple factthis astonishing experiment gave suddencelebrity and popularity to electricity accountsof it were written to every countrywhere science could penetrate all personswere eager to feel the shock notwithstandingthe terrible account of itnumbers of people made their livelihood bygoing about and exhibiting it in every partof europe philosophers all went towork to repeat the experiment and to tryto account for what had happened manytheories or suppositions were formed butas dr priestley says in his account of itthe circumstances attending it remain inmany respects inexplicable and the experimentis to this day justly viewed withastonishment by the most profound electricianssince the first discovery of theley den phial its power has been increasedby coating it to a certain height with tinfoilboth with inside and without and itsoon became an essential part of an electricalapparatus an electrical batterysuch as you see in the machine before youor as you lucy called it a tray full ofjars is formed of several leyden jarsconnected together by conductors so asto increase prodigiously the power and accumulationof electricity to console you harry for not attemptingto explain what i cannot explaini will describe what i can describe theelectric kite of franklin his delight andastonish merit were great on hearing of theleydenjar he repeated the experimenthis ardour increased in pursuit of electricaldiscovery and a most brilliant discoverysoon rewarded his genius and perseverancesome points in which the flashand sound of electricity seemed to resemblethunder and lightning had early occurredto him and he now resolved to examinethe truth of his conjecture by experimentsbut harry it is very important to informyou that several other people had long beforebeen on the brink of this discovery had actually touched it but had let it gothe man who first saw the electric light ahundred and fifty years before this timesaid and wrote that the crackling noise andflash reminded him of thunder and lightning but he pursued the idea no furtherat a more advanced period of our electricalknowledge their identity with thunderand lightning was again suggested byothers but franklin when once thehappy thought occurred to him pursued itunremittingly and has left us what is almostas valuable as his discovery an accountof the reasoning by which his mindarrived at that grand truth this harryyou will be curious to know hereafter i am curious to know it now sircried harry will you tell it me no that is not in my promise saidsir rupert that would lead me too farawayfrom my present engagement to lucythis much to please you i will mentionthat franklin argued thus with himself iflightning be the same as electricity it willobey the same laws it can be managedby the same means if there be electricfire in a thunder cloud it may be attractedand brought down to the earth by someof those substances which are found toconduct it he therefore made a kite of asilk handkerchief stretched on a light crossof wood with an iron wire pointing upwardsthe string was of twine to theend of the string he tied a silk ribbon andwhere the silk and twine joined he fasteneda key lucy can you tell me why he tieda silk ribbon below the key why did nothe hold the kite by the keybecause the key would be a conductorand bring the lightning down to his handbut the ribbon would stop it because silkas you told me is a nonconductor very true said sir rupert butharry why did not he hold the kite by thstwine because perhaps he thought sir saidharry that if it rained and if the twineshould be wet in the thunder shower itwould like the weet packthread used formerlyconduct the lightning down to hishandjust so harry all that he had foreseenhappened and all the precautions hehad taken succeeded in preventing dangerhis kite went up as soon as a thundercloudcame over it the electrical matter inthe cloud was attracted by the iron wireconductor it rained the string was wetthe lightning ran along the string to thekey and there was stopped from going ontohis hand by the silk ribbonoh i am glad of it cried lucy iam glad he succeeded he deserved success he afterwards applied this discoveryto a useful purpose upon the same principleas that of his electric kite he attachedrods or chains of iron to buildings andconnecting them with the earth the electricfire of the clouds was safely conductedthere and away from all it could injureand here at this excellent application ofthe discovery i will leave you my youngfriends i cannot leave you with an impressionmore favourable to sciencebut sir said harry could not yougo on i do not say now but another daycould not you go on to the discoveries madesince that time and then to galvanism andmagnetism no harry i cannot i will not saidsir rupertbut sir rupert could not you atleast be so good as to explain to lucy whati now recollect was a thing that puzzledme the difference between positive and negativeelectricity you never mentionedthem is it not necessary to understandwhat they mean vnecessary to the knowledge of thescience of electricity certainly said sirrupert but you know i did not undertaketo teach you thatno but i wish you would saidboth harry and lucycome with me and i will show youhow impossible it is for me to fulfil yourwishthey followed and he led them to thelibrary their father who was writing aletter looked up as they came in andsaw sir rupert go to one of the bookcasesand take down two volumes one of thema very thick quarto these he laid on thelibrary table before harry and lucyto give some idea said he of thequantity that has been written and may bevol ivread and learned upon the subject of electricitylook at these volumesharry's father looked at the titlesoh sir rupert what have you done it is all over with harry now thought heand sighedone of these volumes the largest ofthem was the very book which harry hadsat up a night to read his eyes grewround the moment he espied it againand pouncing upon it he neither sawnor heard any thing more not even hisfather's sighpoor innocent sir rupert equally unconsciousof the delight and of the alarmhe had given to father and son stood consideringlucy with whom also as his illfate would have it his intended good lessonwas not operating as he had designedhe had expected that lucy would havebeen completely awed by the sight of thebulk of these volumes and that by turningover the pages and the titles he couldhave soon proved to her how vain an attemptit must be for her to master such avoluminous subject but it chanced thatthe lesser of the quartos was left to herand immediately turning to its excellentindex she found ani electrical parti ofpleasures and a bill of fare that quickenedher appetite amazingly as she read electrical eel electrical dinner dinner of electricians the turkey to bekilled by an electrical shock roasted byan electrical jack before a fire kindled byan electric spark the healths of all thecompany to be drank in electrified bumpersunder the discharge of an electricalbattery very good philosophical nonsense afterall said sir rupert addressing himselfto harry's father and not clearly understandingthe cause of the uneasinessvisible in his countenance franklinwell knew how to catch and fix the attentionof young and old there is no harmis there in her amusing herself withthese things she will soon find what shecan understand and what she cannotd her father assented but still the uneasinessin his countenance continuing sirrupert added she is too sensible a girl to pretend toknow what she does not know she willnever i will venture to say turn out oneof those mere index hunters who somewitty poet describes as catching the eelof science by the tail but let youngpeople catch the eel any way they can sothat they do but catch it but we must be sure that they canhold it afterwards said her father true true you are right and i waswrong misled by my own simile as reasonersfond of similes usually are saidthe candid sir rupert harry said his father harrystartedi am sorry to see you at that bookagain i am sorry that you are sorry fathersaid harry in some confusionyou recollect what happened last yearharry you lost a whole month of yourlife trying to make an electrical machinei found your head so full of that book thati could get nothing else into it like anintellectual glutton you had devoured tillyour mind had an indigestion and absolutelycould not stirbut i am a year older now and ayear wiser i hope you shall see howmoderate i will be if you will let me finishthe book while i am here i will read itonly one hour before breakfast and ireally think i deserve that father becausefrom the time you stopped me i not onlyput it quite out of my head but nevermentioned it or electricity even to lucytill just now when she showed me theelectrical machine and then indeed itall came out and it was all my fault said lucythere is no fault in the case mvdear children said their father letus consider only what is best foryouharry closed his book and without utteringa word returned it to sir rupertwith proud submission and dignified humilityi will give you my reasons as well asmy advice harry said his father for youare a reasonable creature and whereverpracticable opinion should be supportedby reasons even from age to youth evenfrom a father to his soni advise you my dear son to deferthe pleasure of reading that entertainingbook and to reserve electricity altogetheras a study for a later period of your life because in the first place you have nottime for it at present you have manythings more necessary to learn more essentialto the progress of your education in other words essential to your acquiringthat strength of understanding which canalone enable you to advance in knowledgehereafter neither boy nor man can embraceall the sciences at once you arenow learning those which are in a state ofcertainty as far as human certainty goes electricity as a science is in but an imperfectstate since that book has beenwritten many discoveries have been madenew and vast views have been opened otwhich at this moment none can even guessthe termination many of the theoriesadopted as certain when that book waspublished are now considered as obsoleteor what is worse unfoundedi beg your pardon for interruptingyou father said harry but the factsproved by experiments must remain thesame must not they as far as they go t true harry replied his father asfar as they go they remain the same butthe explanations of the phenomena thereasonings on these experiments and theconclusions formed from them have variedin consequence of later information andwill vary from day to day as fresh experimentsand newer discoveries are made so that supposing harry you gave upevery thing else in order to make yourselfmaster of all the knowledge in thisthick quarto and granting that you accomplishedthis object in what conditionwould you be not up to the modernstate of the science far from it on thecontrary not in nearly so good a conditionfor advancing as you are in at this momentbecause you would have much tounlearn and false notions and favouriteprepossessions to lay aside if you postponereading this work for some years thescience will probably have taken a morestable form then go on with electricity ifyou will when you are able to distinguishtruth from error you will readthis book with infinite advantage and youwill find it not only an excellent history ofthis particular science but an admirableview of the progress of the human mindin making discoveries and an invaluablelesson in the errors as well as the efforts ofthe human understanding have i satisfiedyou harry satisfied oh thank you my dearfathers said harrythere were certain nephews and niecesof lady digby's whom sir rupert hadonce mentioned regretting that they couldnot be at digby castle while harry andlucy were there by some new arrangementof journeying it was however discoveredto be quite possible that they couldnow come to spend three whole dayswhen this was announced harry to saythe truth felt more sorry than glad heknew that the pleasures of the workshopand of the laboratory must be given upand that they could not hope to have somuch of sir rupert's conversation and instruction besides harry was not naturallyinclined to like strangers neverthelesswhen they arrived he liked them tolerablywell even the first evening theparty consisted of a father and mothertwo daughters and three sons of theboys one was about harry's age theothers younger the young ladies wereolder than lucy almost grown up andquite unaffected goodhumoured and gaywhen they went out to walk all togetherthey became well acquainted and soonjoined in various amusements as theyd swere standing on the bowlinggreen oneof the boys observed that there were bowlsin the alcove his brothers ran for themand all began to play at bowls its beingrather an oldfashioned game was no objection but the young ladies found thebowls rather heavy and cumbersome onhearing this lady digby suddenly recollecteda ball of a new sort which she hadbrought from london thinking it wouldbe agreeable to some of her young friendsshe went for it and returned bearing inher hand a ball as large as lucy's headand of a beautiful light brown colourit looked transparent it felt light as afeather sir rupert bid harry try if itwould bound well harry struck it on theground and it rebounded high over theheads of the admiring circle higher as alldeclared than ever ball was seen to boundbefore all inquired eagerly of whatis it made all examined it and guessedbut none guessed rightly sir rupert toldthem that it was made of caoutchouc whichis naturally very elastic but by a new andingenious mode of preparation it may beblown out to almost any size this ball then is filled with nothingbut air so that it is no wonder that itshould be light said lucysir rupert said that he had seen suchballs in a shop the day before he lefttown they were then quite new thingswhile the showman was showing him howwell one of them rebounded it suddenlydisappeared and for some time could nowherebe found at last it was discoveredin a comer a shrunk shrivelled bao ithad struck upon a nail a young personwho was in the shop suggested that acovering of leather might preserve suchballs from similar disasters in future sirrupert did not know whether this advicehad been followed but he had little doubtthat the ball would become popular it wasmuch admired by the present company forits elasticity its beauty and its safety forwith this they could play even in thehouse without danger to windows or tolookingglassesthey played with their new ball till bychance it fell among the branches of a treeone of the young alloys lady digby'snephews climbed the tree with greatagility to bring it down some one saidhe vas as active as a harlequin and thisled another to mention a harlequin entertainmenthe had lately seen and from harlequinentertainments they talked of pantomimesand it was proposed that theyshould act pantomimes this eveningharry and lucy had never tried butthey were very willing to take any partproposed to them they understood thatthe thing to be done was to represent byaction without speaking any well knownstory or character or event in fictionpoetry or history after having assisted insome subordinate parts their companionsbegged harry and lucy to choose somesubjects for themselves they proposedseveral but from want of experience theirchoice was seldom happyharry's first thought was william telland the tyrant who ordered him to shootat an apple placed on his son's headharry was provided with a bow and arrowsfor william tell a tyrant waseasily found but who could stand for thechild harry stuffed a little coat withstraw and lucy made it a head and put ahat on and the apple was set on the hatbut harry could not hit the apple and thestuffed child tumbled on its nose and whenits hat fell off there was an end of williamtellmiss mallory recommended the favouritestories in english history of alfreddisguised as a minstrel in the danishcamp and of alfred in the old woman'scottage the new performers hadgood success harry in the character ofalfred wasted and burned the cakes withwellacted carelessness and lucy's box onthe ear was capital but these had beenacted rather too often at digby castle tohave the charm of noveltylucy was resolved now to choose quitea new subject and she thought of one fromthe new arabian tales xailoun surnamedthe silly who was desired by hiswife to change himself and who nevercould find out what she meant but nobodywas acquainted with xailoun or hisfollies this was as much too new as theother subjects were too oldlucy next proposed surely an unexceptionablescene the parting of hector andandromache harry to be hector andmiss mallory andromache for sheacts so well said lucy and i act soill but i think i could be the nurse soitwas arranged hector provided himselfwith a dazzling helm and noddingcrest to scare the young astyanax butunluckily though they had chosen theleast of the children from the porter'slodge the child was too old to clingcrying to the nurse's breast obviouslytoo large for nurse mother or fatherthe young astyanax besides wasterribly awkward he would keep histhumb in his mouth notwithstanding allhis nurse could do to hold down his handastyanax began to kick and pushed hisfather from him in the midst of andromache'sdistress there was no standingthe contrast hector and andromacheparted more abruptly than they had intendedand left the nurse to get off astyanaxas she couldthey were more successful in ulyssesand euryclea lucy was admirable aseuryclea and started finely at the sight ofthe scar but this was too short onestart is not enough to make a good pantomimeharry proposed to lengthen it byplacing penelope at her loom and shootingthe suitors at their riotous feast a feastis always a good thing for acting as fredericmallory observed and his eldest sisterwho was tall and graceful would act penelopebeautifully her mother's shawl andveil happily disposed converted her intothe queen of ithaca in a trice and whenharry had taught her to weave and unweaveshe bent over her loom with dignityand pensive sat and mourned bylamplight in the great hall but a penelopewas nothing without suitors vainwas the bow of ulysses for he had nobodyto shoot only three suitors couldbe had the three young alloys andthey were dressing for the forty thievesan experienced manager however suggestingthat the suitors might be supposedto be feasting in the diningroom he leftthe door half open between them and thequeen ulysses looked in and frownedand twanged his bow at them through thedoor way with fine tragic effectharry and lucy found that in the pantomimicart as in all others actual experimentis necessary in the selection of subjectsas well as in the mode of executionone general remark was made that thecaliph haroun alraschid and his viziergiafar were constantly well received sowere zobeide and her favourite with the longunpronounceable name nouzhatoul aouadat there was something in the turbanand in the eastern costume which was becoming this prepossessed the spectatorsfavourably at first sight besides the effectof the complete disguise upon the actorsthemselves gave them courage the onlypart in which harry felt at ease was ingiafar his black face was as good asamask behind which his own was safelyconcealed when thus thoroughly incognitothe little actors can forget themselvesand be what they representit is peculiarly difficult to act any part approachingto our own character or touchingupon our real tastes of this truth lucywas made sensible by a mistake she fell intoin the choice of a character for harryshe persuaded him to act archimedesit did not suit him at all lucy actedthe soldier bravely with a drawn swordbrandished high over his head but harrywas a very awkward archimedes at his problem and this was the more mortifyingbecause there was not time to prepareanother part for him it was the last nightand too late to act any thing else it wasdisagreeable to end with a failureharry and lucy however showed somuch good humour upon this as well asupon many other occasions during theseplays that though they failed in most oftheir attempts at acting they succeeded inmaking themselves liked by their youngcompanions the good nature and perfectfreedom from little jealousies displayedby the whole party made them allhappy together and harry and lucyagreed on the morning when their youngfriends were leaving them that the visithad been very pleasant though it had interruptedthem in their own little pursuitssuch interruptions are good for us allthey prevent us from becoming selfish they teach us to turn readily and in anobliging manner from one thing to anotherand further show us that there aremany ways of employing the time and ofoccupying the mind different from ourown and yet which tend to the same endsutility and happinessthe carriage drove from the door andby the time the sound of the wheels wasout of hearing harry and lucy whowere standing in the porch heard in thehall the short little bark of a dog andthen that sort of noise which is made bya provoked cat which ould fain callby a more genteel name than spittingif we could find any that would bettersuit the action the short bark theyknew to be that of sir rupert's own littleterrier dustfoot the other sound theysuspected to come from the housekeepersgreat persian cat selima who was rathera spiteful creatureoh the ball the ball hamr criedlucyharry ran to the rescue at that instantthere was silence the dog had thegreat ball between his paws the cat withher backup hair erect tail still eyes glaringstood and looked while harry pattingthe dogs head with one hand drew awaythe ball with the other but with a suddenspring the cat darted forward and sether paw upon it harry seizing hold ofher leg shook it and loosened the claw she gave him one scratch and seemedto meditate another lucy then advancedunfurled her parasol full in thecreature's face and straight selima fled toher regions below no shame for cat tofly before that terror which has ere nowscared the most furious of the tiger racethe ball is safe said harry aftercareful examination selima's vile clawshave not gone through it has had a narrowescape in future we will put it in aplace of safetywhile harry looked round to decidewhere that place of safety should be lucypatted dustyfoot who stood wagging histail apparently much satisfied with himselffor having so well defended his mastersproperty but he suddenly sprung frombeneath her hands and darting to an openingdoor ran to meet his master sir ruperthad the key of the laboratory in hishand which he held up to harry andlucy and they followed him with thespeed of dustyfootharry was going to inquire where theyshould secure the ball but sir rupert interruptedhim by asking what is the matter with that bleedinghand of yours which is tied up in yourhandkerchief only a scratch sir answered harryin his cutthemattershort tone lucydesired no better than to fight the battleoer again but after all harr said lucy iwish you would let me put some courtplaster on the scratch she had oneprecious bit in her pocketbook which sheproduced no harry would not hear ofof it court plaster would never stickupon him he said a man must never mind a scratch that i have known ever since i was fouryears old said sir rupert neverthelesssince i have come to man's estate ihave found that scratches are troublesomewhen they fester and if you will take myadvice harry accept your sister's offeryou will be able to do nothing in the laboratorywith your hand muffled up in thatfashionthis was an unanswerable argumentwhereupon harry surrendered his hand but he persisted in his objections to courtplaster goldbeater's skin was the onlything which would stick on his woundssir rupert recollected that in edward'spress some might be found edward'spress as everybody knows was in the laboratorysir rupert unlocked it observingthat as in his son's absence hewas sole guardian and administrator of hiseffects he had no scruples in administeringthislucy opened her eyes at the sight of apiece of goldbeater's skin a foot wide anda quarter of a yard long she cut off thestrip she wanted inquiring at the sametime what goldbeater's skin was sir ruperttold her that this skin so called fromits being used by gold beaters was the innermembrane of one of the intestines ofan ox narrow slips of which are joinedsimply by moistening and laying theedges over each other he added thatthe gold was first flattened between steelrollers then beaten out between leaves ofparchment with broad heavy hammers and lastly reduced to the proper degree ofthinness between pieces of this membraneby beating them with lighter hammerslucy next asked why edward had sucha store of this among his valuables didhe cut his fingers so very often as to needsuch a provision sir rupert told her that edward had itfor a very different purpose for mendingballoons at the word balloon delight andeager curiosity glowed in harry's andin lucy's facesoh sir cried harry did he eversend up a balloon only some very small ones withwhich we were trying some experimentswell even a small one said lucyi should like to see for i never saw aballoon in my lifesir rupert went back to edward's pressand took down from the hook on which ithung a bag or bladder about the size of aman's headharry observed it was thinner than anybladder he had ever seen it was a readyformed globe in which he could discoverno joining he asked what it was madeof from what he had heard about thecaoutchouc ball he began to suspect thatthis little balloon might be of the samesubstance animal or vegetable sir askedheanimal answered sir rupert hetold them it was the craw of a turkeyharry began to blow into it to swell itout that they might see its full extentsir rupert desired him to take care whathe was about and to handle it gently forit was one of his son's most precious valuablesit was the craw of an uncommonlylarge norfolk turkey and had beenpeculiarly well prepared some skill andcare were necessary he observed in thecleansing and preparation he knew thathis housekeeper had spoiled several beforethe art had been attained so completely asto render them thus inoffensive to smelland so light as to be the balloon maker'slucy admired its delicate texture and weight harry observed that therehad been several little tiny holes in it notlarger than pin holes which had beencarefully patchedyes as sir rupert said it had been intruth most carefully patched he had seenhis son at it for half a day sir rupertbid them guess how edward had contrivedto detect all these small fractures whichwere scarcely discernible before the patcheshad marked their situationlucy thought that in the first place hemust have blown air into the craw so asto swell it out nearly to its utmost extentand then he might have pressed it to discoverwhere the air came out and there hemust have applied his patches this was the way he first tried saidvol iv esir rupert but his feeling was not acuteenough he was obliged to think of anothermethod can you invent what thatwas rlucy at this moment saw a bit of downyfeather which was floating in the air assir rupert observed her eye caught by ithe said that is a good idea lucyedward held a bit of down as light as thisto the parts of the balloon where he suspectedthere were holes and as he pressedthe balloon the motion of the light filamentsgave him notice of the place fromwhence the air issued but this dovn wasnot sufficiently sensitive to detect thesmallest holesperhaps said harry edward wentround it with a lighted taper holding theflame as near to the surface as he couldwithout endangering its safety and atwhatever place he perceived that the flameof the candle was blown he must have beensure that there was a hole you are right harry said sir rupert this way succeeded very wellandstill better when he fixed the lightand turned the globe round so that hemight try each part in succession but why was it necessary to fill upevery little hole so excessively carefullyasked harry my uncle's balloon wentup very well without all that caresir rupert asked of what size it wasand with what it was filledit was about ten feet in diameter answeredharry it was filled with hotair from a fire of lighted straw over whichits mouth was heldsir rupert explained to him that theturkey's craw was to be filled with hydrogengas which is much more difficult toconfine than the common heated air thathad been used for filling the balloonharry had seen at his uncle'slucy was very much afraid that harrywould ask some further question befoi'cshe should have time to make a petitionwhich was on her lips and which waskeeping her breathless with anxiety well my dear lucy said sir rupertetaking compassion upon her say whateveryou want to say i wish i could see a balloon go upcried lucy and the vehemence of the exclamationexpressed the strength of thewishthen you shall if we can manage tosend one up for you said kind sir rupertbut only this squall one i have no other will this content you oh yes thank you sir said lucyany one for i never saw anysir rupert asked how it had happenedthat she had not seen that which harry sawat his uncle's because she was not there it was atthe time of her long visit to aunt pierrepointharry said and i hope she willnever be away so long againthen turning to the balloon harry's andlucy's attention anxiously waited for whatsir rupert should say next to their greatsatisfaction he determined on filling thelittle balloon that very day he would immediatelylook for the materials for makingthe hydrogen gas and explain the processwhich was very simple he saidthat he knew he might leave them toharry's care though it was not to everyoneof his age that sulphuric acid shouldbe trustedharry and lucy in the same breaththough in different tones said thankyou oh thank you sirbut before we go to the sulphuricacid sir said harry could you be sokind as to tell us something more aboutballoons i mean of their use i have seenonly one and know very lite about themfrom what you said just now saidlucy i understand that there are differentkinds i should like to know how theydiffer but what i particularly wish tohear is how balloons were invented if youwould be so very good as to begin at thevery beginning of their history then i must go back again to thereign of charles h my dear said sir rupert and even to an earlier period aboutfour hundred years before his time whenasthe biographical dictionary makerswould tell novi flourished one roger baconnot the great philosopher bacon but amonk a most ingenious man with whosename perhaps harry is acquainted hewho made that brazen head which is saidto have pronounced the words time istime was time will be whether hisbrazen head ever pronounced these wordsor any other i will not take upon me todecide you may judge of the probabilityfor yourselves added he smiling but what is more certain he made a discoverywhich was scarcely less extraordinary gunpowder and it was he whoinvented lucy what is more in your wayand will please you better the camera obscurait was this roger bacon that firstsuggested the possibility of a machineby which a man might mount into theair but none believed him somehundred years as usual passed betweenthe first suggestion and accomplishmentof a great invention nothing more wasdone or attempted after roger the great'stime till the days of that constellation ofscientific men who shone forth at the firstestablishment of our royal society incharles the second's reignat that period there arose another boldgenius of the name of wilkins a daringinventor who rather imprudently publishedbefore he had actually tried theexperiment that he should soon be ableto fly with wings of his own contrivanceby the aid of these wings he was not onlyto raise but sustain himself in the air andto travel in a flying chariot which by mechanicalmeans he promised himself hecould guide at pleasure and raise orlower by the movement of his wingshe further prophesied that in futuretimes men would travel through the airas commodiously and as easily as on thewater or on the earth and that the daywould come when people would call fortheir wings in setting out on a journey ascommonly as men call for their bootsthose were his words and they have beentoo often repeated in scorn of projectorsand inventorsi am sorry said harry that he wasso imprudent as to boast before handwhatever he might hope did he try anyexperiment he tried and tried but let him try or wood or wirehe never got two inches higheri am sorry for it repeated harryi cannot bear when ingenious men donot succeed in their inventions for thenstupid people laugh at themtherefore ingenious men should beprudent harry and not bolt out their inventionsbefore they have tried them thewings did not answer and as there appearedto be little probability that his audaciousprophecy would ever be fulfilledthe world both learned and unlearnedjoined in laughing at wilkins and at hiswings send his voyage to the moon evenphilosophers deemed it beyond the powersof mechanism or science for man to mountand sustain his flight in the air and commonpeople expressed their sense of theimpracticability or visionary nature of anyscheme by saying it is as impossible asto fly or to mount above the cloudsyet this was not impossible for scienceat last exclaimed harry triumphantlyabout the same time continued sirrupert an ingenious jesuit of the nameof lana laying aside the idea of wingsthought of mounting in the air on thinhollow copper globes in which he hadproduced a vacuum a vacuum very ingenious criedharry did he succeed no poor man he failed with all hisingenuity he did not know how to makehis vacuum perfect enough besides theweight of his copper balls was too great and when he made them very thin thepressure of the atmosphere drove theminwards and destroyed themah there was no resistance withinsaid harry who came next another ingenious man galen whoe wrote a little book in which he plainlysaid that if any lighter kind of air thanthe common atmosphere could be foundand if a bag were filled with it peoplemight mount by means of it into the airthat is exactly the description of aballoon is not it sir said harry yes but he never discovered thislighter kind of air said sir rupert he only said ii said lucyhis principle however was quiteright but there it remained no one appliedor pursued it for another century tillat last the simplest observation imaginableled again to the right point from observingthe smoke rising in the air andclouds floating in the atmosphere it occurredto montgolfier montgolfier exclaimed lucy nowi know we are coming to real balloonsit occurred to montgolfier continuedsir rupert that if he could confine thesmoke or the cloud in a bag it would riseinto the air and that if he could fill thebag with it on earth he could mount alongwith it to the skies pursuing these ideashe observed that air when heated islighter than when not heated because it ismore expanded more rarefied and he resolvedto try heated air for his balloon now he has it cried harryyes said sir rupert when filledwith heated air up it went then hisnext ambition was to make a balloon thatshould not only rise itself but carry himup also for this purpose it was necessaryto ascertain what size would give itsufficient power when the capacity of aballoon is such that the difference betweenthe weight of the lioht heated air that itcouta'uhs and that of the heavier atmosphericair which it displaces is exactlyequal to the united weijjhts of the manthe car and the balloon then that balloonwill just float in the air but as we findthat the atmosphere is gradually thinnerand lighter in proportion as we rise abovethe earth so it becomes necessary tomake the balloon considerably larger inorder to ascend to anv rreat elevationthe difference between these weights iscalled the ascension power and you seeharry continued sir rupert how necessaryit was for this great inventor toknow how to calculate with exactness orhe would never have mounted in triumphinto the air as he did he did mount then cried lucy ohyes i know he didthis balloon was filled with air rarefiedor heated by a fire of straw made underneathit continued sir rupert andcrowds of spectators assembled at paris tosee the first public experiment which completelysucceeded but i need not describeit as accounts of it can be read inso many books in prose and in versebut how did he keep up askedharry for when the outside air cooledthe heated air inside his balloon he musthave come downvery true harry but then he carriedfire up with him fastened to the bottomof the balloon to keep the air withinconstantly rarefiedwas not that very dangerous t saidlucy it was said sir rupert thosefire balloons are very dangerousand besides said harr how couldthey carry up weight of fuel enough tosupply the fire yes that was another difficulty saidsir rupertand how were all these difficultiesconquered said harrythey are not all conquered yet answeredsir rupert but some improvementshave been made by what means sir said harry principally by chemical means longbefore the time of jniontgolfier philosophershad discovered a kind of air or gasthat was much lighter than atmosphericair it was first called inflammable airfrom its property of easily inflaming butnow it is called hijdrogeti gasthen still even that was dangeroussaid lucyyes said sir rupert but it onlybinflames when it conies in contact withflame if we keep it from this it is safe well that was much better saidlucy than carrying up fire flaming underthe balloons then they filled them withthis hydrogennot for some time first one mansaid it might be tried and another mantried it but only in blowing large soapbubbles at last three ingenious chemistsemployed this gas in filling a large balloonwhich was made of silk and well varnishedto keep it from escaping and i hope that kept it in tight saidlucy for then the man might stay up inthe air as long as he pleasedit kept it in too well said sir rupert as it rose very high the outward pressureof the atmosphere became so much lessthat the gas expanded with great forceand having no way to escape the silkburst and down fell the balloonand the poor men said lucy whatbecame of them they did not go up in it said sirrupert but the experiment succeededso well that the inventors resolved to tryit again and this time to go up themselvesfor now having considered what causedthe accident they thought that they hadfound out a way of preventing it from happeningagainsir rupert paused to give harry timeto think what wayharry said to himself the balloonburst because the gas could not get outwhen it expanded perhaps sir saidhe they put a valve to their balloonsomething like the safetyvalve of a steamengineso that they could let some of itout when they likedjust so said sir rupertthis succeeded then said lucy how far did they go about a league as well as i remembersaid sir rupert only a league three miles saidlucy i thought people had gone muchfarther in balloonsmuch farther some time afterwardssaid sir rupert one man crossed thesea from england to france and anotherwent three hundred miles in a few hours seven i thinkthree hundred miles in seven hours that is real flying said lucyi wish i had been with him saidharryhe was in great danger said sirrupert he went up at night hisballoon was filled with this inflammablegas and illuminated by several lampshung round ithow beautiful it must have beencried lucybut very dangerous said harryfor how could he let out the gas whenit was necessary the lamps would haveset it on firehe was not quite so imprudent as youthink said sir rupert he had provideda contrivance for keeping the hydrogensafe from the lamps as well as topermit his letting it out occasionally duringhis voyage but it happened that at thetime his balloon was filling the mob ofparis crowded round it and they were soimpatient that they would have torn it topieces if he had delayed they would noteven give him time to adjust his apparatusto the safety valve he rose with unexampledrapidity high above the clouds the balloon suddenly expanded he sawthe danger but from fear of the lamps hedared not let out the hvdrooen it swelledmore he saw it must burst in anotherminute what did he do harryhe put out the lamps answeredharry yes said sir rupert with onehand he stretched to the lamps and extinguishedas many as he could reachwhile with the other he tore a rent in theballoon to let out the gas the inflammableair was discharged in great quantitiesand thus his presence of mind savedhimgreat presence of mind indeed saidlucy i wonder how people can thinkat all up in clouds at that terrible heightand no possible assistance near themshe wished to hear more entertainingadventures of people who had gone uponvoyages of discovery in balloonssir rupert told her that he would putinto her hands a book in which she mightread all the adventures of these aeronautsor aerial voyagers related as he said inamuch more amusing manner than hecould tell them i will look for the bookfor you in the library and you may readit before you see our balloon go up orafterwards whichever you please before if you please sir i shouldlike it now answered lucy it is sopleasant to read about things at the verytime when we are thinking of them harrywill you come and read it with me no thank you said harry if one ofus read it that will do you will tell it tomeafterwards and i want to see how thisballoon is to be filled i should like to see that too saidlucysir rupert began the operation heput some filings of iron into a bottle andupon these he poured sulphuric acid dilutedwith about six times the quantity ofwaterlucy as soon as she saw the sulphuricacid kept at a safe distance she didwisely when the acid was poured uponthe iron filings a cloud of white vapourrose and she perceived a peculiar smellsir rupert told her that the gas whichwas then rising was hydrogen and withthis the little balloon was to be filledsir rupert then took a bent glass tubewhich was open at both ends one end heplaced in the neck of the bottle and theother in a jug almost full of water so thatthe gas after passing through this tubewas made to rise through the water in thejug in order to purify it over the jug heput a glass funnel with its broad mouthdownwards to collect the little bubbles ofgas which rose to the surface of the watersir rupert having placed this apparatuson the floor took the little balloon andsuspended it from a walkingstick whichhe laid on the backs of a couple of chairsthe aperture in the bottom was tied fastround a piece of quill about an inch ofwhich was left projecting beyond the placewhere it was tied this he put into thesmall end of the funnel and plasteredround their joining with a lute made ofthat which was ready at hand some almondpaste and water and he also luted theglass tube into the neck of the bottle thejoining being now airtight none of thegas could escape except through the quillwhich left an open passage for it into theballoonpresently lucy saw the bubbles risingmore and more thickly and as the gasascended through the funnel she observedthat it began to inflate the balloonas the affair however seemed to proceedbut slowly she thought it would be tiresometo stay till it was finished especiallyas she could be of no use she said thereforethat she was satisfied and went tothe library to read the adventures of theother aromatic voyagerssir rupert accompanied her and havingkindly marked several entertainingpassages he returned to harry who ashesaid would want his assistancelucy had time to read all that sir ruperthad marked in the history of aerial voyagesbefore the little balloon was filledshe found harry alone in the laboratorywhen she returned holding the balloonwhich was now a perfect globe quite inflatedhe showed her that the quill wasstopped at the bottom by a little plug ofcork which sir rupert had stuck in whenthe balloon was sufficiently expanded sothat he might clean off the luting withoutfear of losing any of the gasi am glad sir rupert staid to do allthis for me said harry and that ihave seen how quick and dextrous it isnecessary to be with it you are comejust at the right time lucy added he we had but just finishedlet go the string harry by whichyou are holding the balloon said lucy that i may see if it will go upgo up to be sure it will said harrylook how it pulls against my hand iam fastening this little weight to the bottomof it i think it will carry this upalso that little weight said lucy isthat all it is able to carryall and a great deal it is said harry for such a small balloonit may be a good weight for it to carryin proportion to its size to be sure saidlucy now harry pray loosen thestring there there up it mounts but i do not wish it to mount toohigh or to strike itself against the ceilingcried harry i must add more weighthe added a little more weight and triedit again and at length to satisfy lucy helet go the string it seemed to be nicelybalanced above their heads halfway betweenthe floor and ceiling after remainingstill a few moments it moved towardsthe fireplace as if as lucy said it wantedto warm itself and when it had remainedthere till it was warm enough went awayagain the fact was as harry observedthat the draught or current of air waftedit towards the fireplace as it approachedthe fire heated the gas within so that theballoon rose higher towards the ceilingand floated about till the gas cooling itdescended and again wafted by the draughtthe same movements were repeated harryobserved them with untired interest callingout now it rises because and nowe itfalls because cbut after a minute or two lucy said it is very curious but when will youlet it up out of doors harry i want tosee it go up to the clouds as soon as my father and sir rupertcome back said harry in the mean time said lucy i willtell you what i have been reading sirrupert might well say it was entertaining but i cannot tell it to you if you are soentirely intent upon that balloon but my dear i am not entirely intentupon it i can hear you very wellah you can hear i know but youwill not listen to me comfortably whileyou are watching that balloon then said harry laughing youmust watch the balloon and i will listento you while i am sharpening my knife and your's too if you will give it to memay'ldo thatoh yes thank you said lucy iknow you can listen while you do thatmy dear harry do you know any thingabout parachutes vno answered harry nothingi am glad of it said lucy for i cantell you something at least about them parachutes are used to prevent the dangerin falling from balloons the name parachutefrom the french word chute showsits use it is a sort of umbrella whichspreads out of itself the moment it feelsthe resistance of the air and that preventsit from coming too suddenly down aman tried it first with his dog he fastenedhim to a small parachute and when theballoon was at a great height he droppedhim out the parachute spread and very well said harry i see theparachute must have been of use in preventinghis descending too quicklyso i thought my dear harry and soitwould have been but for the wind thewind blew and blew till it was a greatstorm quite a whirlwind the poor dogand parachute were blown up and downand all manner of ways and at the sametime the man in his balloon was equallytossed about without power to stop orto guide himself at last when the stormbegan to cease man and dog came in sightof each other again and the dog knowingmaster began to bark just as he wouldhave done upon earth once they came soclose together that the master stretchedout his hand to take him into the balloonbut another provoking gust of wind whirledhim away however at last the man andthe dog came to the ground man firstdog next with his parachute quite safely then it succeeded you see saidharry yes this time said lucy butanother time a poor man broke his leg byvol iv fcoming down with a parachute and youmust know harry i am sorry to tell ityou but i must for it is the truth agreat many dreadful accidents have happenedto people with these balloons oneman was burnt to death and several werenear being drowned by dropping into thesea they must have been drowned butfor some goodnatured fishermen who savedthem another balloonman was in aterrible condition a thunderstorm cameon and he in the midst of it up in theclouds he says that at one time he was inastate of insensibility lying at the bottomof the car he does not know how long then bounce came the balloon against theearth and when it rebounded he wasdashed against a rock oh my dearharry at last his anchor hooked in atree and this saved him philosophersmay say what they please but indeed iliiink it is very bad work harry i shouldnot at all like to go up in a ballooni am glad you would not said harryfor i do not think it would be fit foryoubut what is more harry i should notlike that yoii should go up in a balloonsaid lucy that is another affair said harry it is a man's business to brave danger in a good cause said lucyin a good and great cause to be surerepeated harrybut then it comes to this what is agreat causes said lucyis not the cause of science my deara great causei do not know said lucy i thinkit is quite enough if a man hazards his lifefor his country for his father and motherand friends or for poor women sistersand so forth you may ask my father assoon as he comes down stairsnot now said harry we will talkof it another time you know we are goingto the balloon but lucy where is theballoon oh lucy what is become ofit i told you to watch iti do not know cried lucy whathas become of it it must be somewheref in the room but i cannot see it look uponthat high press i will look under thetableshigh and low and everywhere theylooked but without seeing it the windows are shut the door isshut nobody has opened it nobody hascome in nobody has gone out of theroom since we had it safe said harryait must have burst said lucy lookfor the skinit could not have burst without somelittle noise i think said harry we will settle about the noise afterwe have found the skin said lucy buti cannot see any thing like it what canhave become of itharry made another careful search insilence and then said i am now surethat it is not in the room and it could nothave got out of the room any way butone what way asked lucy up the chimney said harryup the chimney said lucy butnow i recollect it is very likely youknow how fond it was of going towardsthe fire it may have stuck in its way up saidharry trying to look up the chimney butnothing was to be seen nothing but darkness said lucypopping up her head as harry withdrewhis harry ran out directly to try if theballoon could be seen hovering over thehouse where it had flown none couldtell one man had seen something veryodd come out of the top of the chimney another had seen this odd something passoverhis head he had thought it was akite he could tell only what he hadthought it was and how much he wassurprised when he saw that it was not whathe had thought but more he could nottellharry ran from field to field jumpedover ditches and jumped back again andbreathless hot and tired came home no wiserthan he had gone out lucy all the timewas exceedingly sorry for her carelessnessfor which harry never once reproached herthey were particularly vexed by theloss of this little balloon because it belongedto edward digby who had assir rupert had told them spent nearly awhole day in patching it the more theythought of it the more they grieved sirrupert did all he could to comfort themby saying that he would take it upon himselfto provide for edward as good andgreat a norfolk turkey's craw as that whichwas lost but added their kind comforteri by no means give it up yet as lost onlystrayed certainly not stolen our neighboursand our neighbours children are allhonest and kind people some one willprobably find our little balloon and bringback its skin tomorrow but now for todayi am sorry you are disappointed iwish i had for you a beautiful little ballooni once possessed my flyingfisha flyingfish i wish we had it saidlucyharry asked what size it wasabout four feet from head to tail andbroad in just proportion for a fish saidsir rupert with proper fins and everythingthat could make it look like a reallive fish it was made of baudrucheharry asked what is baudruche v simply goldbeater's skin baudrucheis the french name for it and my thoughtsgoing back to paris where i had first seensuch a balloon i used the name by whichi had there heard it called i gave mypretty fish to edward who was very youngat that time it was lost in coming over it fell i believe into the seavery natural said lucy for thefish to go into the sea but since we have not that or anyother pursued sir rupert what can bedone now since we have none readymade what would you think of trvino tomake one for yourselves i think it would be the happiest thingin the world said lucy if we could do it said harry why not said lucy if we hadany thing to make it ofsir rupert thought that lady digbywho it seems had every thing that everybodywanted could perhaps furnish a quiteor two of silver paper then we can soon make a balloon ofsilver paper i am sure said lucywe have only three days more to stayat digby castle said harry sighing profoundlyftonly three days indeed said lucyechoing the sigh sincerely but in a moresprightly tone she added three wholedays and this remember is not half goneharry but i wonder you are not moreeager even than i am about our balloon my dear i am eager about it saidharry very eager but i see many difficulties and i am afraid we should onlywaste lady digby s silver paper which iknow is valuable to ladies for their capboxes i would not have you waste that mydears or any thing else said sir rupertsmiling but i can answer for it thatlady digby for such a purpose will giveher silver paper willingly even out of hercap box if it were necessary howeverrona to raise the merit of her sacrificeharry i can tell you that she happens tohave a store of it which she bought foredward there is much to be learned indoing any thing of this sort well and somuch ingenuity must be employed that iam always a promoter of such things iam always for letting my young friendstry their own experimentsbut do you really think sir saidharry that we can succeed tell me how you would set about itand then i will give you my best opinionsaid sir ruperti do not know said harry i onlyknow that it is exceedingly difficult for irecollect that when my uncle's balloon wasmaking he and my father were calculatingand measuring with long tables offigures and scales and beamcompasses but i could not understand what theywere donorsbut that was a year ago harry youknow said lucysir rupert took them to die library andf showed them in one of the plates of theedinburgh encyclopaedia the goie of aballoon with all the requisite dimensionsmarked on itlucy was awestruck at the sight of a'diagram with curves and crossinglinessand as she said with decimals innumerablebut harry's hopes began torevive you once said he covereda ball for me lucy and its cover wasdivided into gores which were very likethis they were all of different colours irecollect and very prettythere was no great difficulty in thatsaid lucy the ball was very small youknow and ready shaped for me i measuredit round and divided it into an equalnumber of parts and counted how manygores of such a breadth in their broadestpart would go round it and then i cut apattern in paper sloping it and guessingby my eye and trying repeatedly whatwould fit then i cut all the leather goresby my paper pattern stuck them roundthe ball with pins and by measuring andcutting pulling and pushing and puckeringstretching and coaxing the ball wasat last finishedlucy showed the manner in which shehad creased her paper in various directionsin order to make her pattern but harrythought it exceedingly difficult and incomprehensiblesir rupert to whom thecase was referred thought that lucy'smethod might do if she took care to allowsufficient margin for joining and to admitof letting out or drawing the pieces closertogether as occasion might require tocompensate for inaccuraciesthe chief difficulty now seemed to betheshape of the pattern gore but lucy'salarm at the innumerable decimals nothaving yet subsided and harry still fearingthat a large part of the three dayswould be consumed in making himselfsufficiently master of the subject to constructit with mathematical accuracy sirrupert compounded with them for a methodwhich he said would answer wellenough for a first attempt let us determine said he what isto be the shape and size of your balloonsuppose it to be a globe of eighteen feetin circumference in that case twelvegores will probably be enough and thegreatest breadth of each of these mustevidently be eighteen inches or a littlemore to allow for a pasting margin it isequally clear that their length must be halfthe circumference of the globe or ninefeet to make your pattern i would adviseyou to paste some sheets of brownpaper together so as to form a narrowparallelogram of nine feet long and eighteeninches wide this you know must betapered to a point at each end not bystraight lines but as you observed harryby curving the sides and as you aredoubtful of accomplishing this with geometricalprecision i think we may trust toyour eye to draw the curves provided youmake the greatest quantity that they bulgeout from a straight edge about a tenth ofthe extreme breadth of the gore that isin this case about one inch and threequartershairy and lucy were eager to begin onthe strength of these directions butnow thought harry what sort of a balloonshall it be he asked sir rupert if hehad ever seen a balloon which carried upfire with it to keep the air within rarified sir rupert said that he had seen severalone in particular he well recollected itspaper cover said he caught fire whenat a considerable height in the air itseemed a globe of flame and for a second ortwo that retained its form it made a mostbeautiful spectacle but harry said sirrupert suddenly checking himself areyou thinking of sending up fire with yourballoonoh yes why not sir cried lucy ishould like very much to see it take firein the airbut sir rupert said he could not consentto this he thought it too dangerousthere are several thatched houses andricks of corn and hay in this neighbourhoodsaid he and if the balloon fellupon them it would set them on firethe moment that this danger was pointedout harry abandoned all further idea of anofireballoon and asked whether he mightfill it with hot air sir rupert willingly consented to thisand told him that they should have achafingdish with burning charcoal bywhich the balloon might be filled withless danger of setting it on fire than if theylighted a fire of straw under it sir rupertadded that though the sending up firewith a balloon from his park would behazardous yet there were other situationsin which it might be done without dangerfor instance when they returned to theseashore they might if their father approvedtry one when the wind blew towardsthe sea sir rupert sat down immediatelyand wrote for them the followingdirections which were committed tolucy's memorandumbook for a futureoccasionchoose a calm dry evening and having erectedin the ground two poles at a sufficient distance apartto prevent the balloon when inflated from touchingthem pass a string through the ring at the crown ofthe balloon and fasten the ends of it to the tops ofhie poles then in order to inflate it place a chafingdishwith burning charcoal under the opening atillthe bottom it will presently swell out and consequentlyrise to a greater distance from the chafingdishwhich will enable you to hook on a small wirebasketcontaining a sponge soaked in spirits of wine this basket will also help to balance the balloon whenin the air the string on which the balloon is suspendedmust be cut at the moment that the spirits ofwine in the sponge is lightedthere is no ancient saying of vvliich thewisdom is more cordially felt by youththan that they who give quickly givetwice lady digby immediately orderedfor them a large deal table placed in oneof the spacious unoccupied bedchamberswhere the carpet being rolled up theymight use floor or table as they liked shealso provided them with a dish of goodpaste two paste brushes two towels thehousekeeper's large cuttingout scissors apair of compasses a long ruler and inshort all they could want including whatonly her kindness could have suorestedtwo pair of steady ablebodied clotheshorsesfrom the laundry on which to hangtheir long sheets of pasted paper to drythey set to work lucy's first businesswas to paste the sheets of silver paper intothe narrow parallelograms while harrywas intent on his brownpaper patternharry's pattern ready lucy cut out allthe twelve gores in the silver paper leavingample room and verge enough in themargin to compensate if necessary for inaccuraciesthen came the magnum opusof putting together the gores they proceedednot without many little disasters tootedious to relate lucy handled her brushin a masterly style lightly and evenly ever keeping strictly within her bounds sheswept along with steady and determinedhand to the end of her course at lasteach pair of gores was pasted togetherand each having been allowed time to drythe patience necessary for which being thegreatest trial of all the whole was witha little coaxing and a little puckeringjoined together it was necessary that theballoon should open wide so that it mightbe held over the fire to be filled with hotair therefore the lower points of the goreswere cut off and the bottom alas pasted rounda lio'ht hoop of cane when they thoughtthe balloon was finished lucy put herdelighted head within it to contemplatethe inside but to her great dismay shesaw various little holes in the paper andthe remainder of the day was spent inputting patches over each detected flawon the morning of their last day theweary business of patching was endedeach hole had its patch and every patchwas dry and never did artists contemplatetheir work with more satisfaction lucy with a few exclamations of delight harry with sober silent admiration theystood before their balloon and wonderedthat it had ever come together and fatherand mother and lady digby and sirrupert successively joined in the sawsurprise and admiration with sincere congratulationsin the moment of successthe general gave due credit to his lieutenantlucy without whose assistance ashewas proud to acknowledge all hisgeneralship would have been of no availhe handsomely acknowledged the skillwith which all had been performed thatwas left to her discretion though perhapshe still more admired that whichthose in command often prefer to ability prompt and mute obedienceit was a fine evening the smi justsetting out they bore their balloon to anopen space in the park it was suspendedfrom the top of the poles which had beenprepared and the burning charcoal wasplaced under the opening at the bottomto inflate it in a few minutes the flaccidbag began to swell out fold after foldthe last gleam of sunset however disappearedbefore it had completely expandedit now pulled slightly againstthe hands of the holdersdown they hadorders not to let it go till the word of commandshould be given lucy who wasone of the holders down felt that it washot service but harry was beside her andemulous of his fortitude she stood firmlytill she heard let go up rose theballoon steady and majestically highyet full in view and paused awhile hangingsin midair like a silver moon from theblue sky the balloon again wafted upwardsand again stood still there wasnow seen a beautiful light on one of itssides lucy thought it could not comefrom the sun because it had disappearedbeneath the horizon it had set for them but as her father told her those who hadgone up in balloons had sometimes seenthe sun set twice once while on the earthand once when raised above it this appearancelasted but for a moment or two afresh breeze arose the balloon sailedrapidly along they eagerly followed itwith their eyes but it did not sail steadilyfar it wavered and turned sideways andfell fell fell on a thornbush nevermoreto riseit is all over said lucy but wasit not beautiful harry have we not hada great deal of pleasure harryharry walked on in silence bearing themangled remains of the balloon after all continued lucy when aballoon does not carry any thing up withit i do not see that it is much better thanakitethis insulting remark roused harry fromhis silence but when he had said all hecould about the ingenuity and curiosity ofthe invention lucy still pressed him totell what use had been made of it andharry embarrassed looked to his fatherand sir rupert for assistance and whateverthey could they suppliedonce a balloon had been used for recvnnoitring that is for discovering thesituation forces and movements of an hostilearmy balloons have also been employedin trying some magnetic and electricalexperiments one ingenious manemployed a balloon on purpose to try aphilosophical experiment on sound hesent up explosive materials for this purposeto be let off at different heights butthe shouts of the crowd below preventedthese from being heardand nothing more found out yet nomore use made of balloons said lucyoh harry what have you to say now that they have gone fast out of favourwith you ever since you read and thoughtabout the danger said harry howeveri must acknowledge it is surprisingthat such a great invention has not yetbeen of more usesir rupert observed that one reason forthis had been that it was so expensive tomake balloons that poor philosophers couldnot afford it the expense however hasnow been somewhat diminished by theuse of coalgas in the place of hydrogenballoons he said were generally sent upmerely as shows and paid for by peoplewho went to see them merely for amusementthe exhibitors therefore thought onlyof producing a grand effect for instancethey made one to represent meg terrifiesanother was a figure clothed in a flamecolouredrobe and another was a pegasustransporting a richlyaccoutred warriorthrough the cloudsoh said lucy i wish they couldmanage the balloon pegasus as the manin the arabian tales managed his by turning one peg he wentup and by turning another he camedownthat may be done yet perhaps saidharry by turning one peg to let the airout and another to let it in if we couldbut guide balloons then indeed theywould be usefuland not till then said his father but do you think father do you thinksir rupert said lucy that the way ofguiding them will ever be found outharry looked eagerly from one to theother in hopes of a favourable answerthey would not say it was impossible they would not say they thought it probablethere was a time when it was thoughtimpossible to do what is now done saidharry who knows but the means ofguiding balloons are close to us and underour eyes and hands just as the rarefiedair for raising them was ready long beforemen invented how to use it true and sensible said sir rupertencouraged by this acknowledgmentharry inquired what attempts had everbeen made to guide balloons he exclaimed what a glorious thing it wouldbe what signifies the danger menmust die some way or other well done well done harry saidsir rupert smiling i believe you havehopes of being a balloonguider yourselfharry blushed and was silent aftera pause he said in a low voice to hisfather i may at least think on the subjectfatherthere is no reason why you shouldnot think of it if you like it harry said hisfather but many great men have thoughtof it and failed there is however nothingto be ashamed of in this wish it springsfrom a praiseworthy ambition and let his ambition take its flightadded sir rupert recollect our ownschemes when we were boys our grandmagnet scheme and our efforts to inventperpetual motion the worst that can besaid is that though it does us no harm itdoes nobody else any goodit may be a satisfaction to some kindyoung heart or to some equally kind oldheart to be assured that sir rupert wasnot mistaken in his good opinion of hisneighbours and his neighbours childrenthe little balloon was brought back byoneof farmer dobson's young folks butthough farmer dobson himself accompaniedhis boy to bring back this sir ay orwaif as he called it to the lord of themanor yet it was now little likely to be ofany further use and no longer worthy tobe placed among edward's valuables forit had first stuck upon the branch of a treethat overhung higglesham ford then ithad fallen into the ford and just at theworst place it could have fallen wherethe cattle came to drink some beast hadset his foot upon it and the great halfmoonrents even lucy could not hope torepairit was all over with it as a balloon butstill its remains were treated with respectand deposited in a drawer with remnantsof other turkeycraws they might be ofservice still to balloons yet unborn whichcould only be mended by patches of the same stuffbut i do not know whether my sonwill care about balloons so much saidsir rupert now that his object has beenaccomplished by other meanswhat was his object asked harryeagerlysir rupert told him that the seacoastin that neighbourhood was dangerous vessels had been driven on shore and hadbeen wrecked property and lives hadbeen lost and edward's imagination hadbeen struck with the thoughts of contrivingmeans of affording assistance to these poorshipwrecked people he knew that it wasoften of the utmost consequence to be ableto carry out a rope from a vessel in distressto the shore and he had at one time hadan idea that small balloons might whenthe wind served be used for this purpose but the object had been lately accomplishedin an ingenious manner by simpler meansa method had been invented of sending arope from a vessel to the shore by meansof a kite which could be made to descendat any place or time required by thebye harry said sir rupert you cannotvol tv gdo better than read the account of this invention i am sorry we did not think ofit sooner that we might have tried it but you shall have the book and take ithome with you i dare say you will beable to make a kite of this sort for yourselfit is a new and perfectly safe invention foryou to try no gas necessary no fire nothing dangerous and something reallywithin your power and present means toaccomplish for a useful purposeharry's mind seized the idea instantlywith enthusiasmyes added sir rupert even theelectric kite which drew down lightningfrom the clouds and which led to the useof conductors to save us from the dangerof thunderstorms could not be more usefulthan such a kite as this which mightsave the lives of thousandssir rupert went with harry immediatelyto the library to look for thisbook and some others which he and lucywished to borrow they were welcometo any upon condition that they wrotedown their names in what was called thebookbook a small volume which lay withthe catalogue upon the library table andin which a debtor and creditor accountwas regularly kept of all that were borrowedand returnedbesides the st volume of the transactionsof the society for the encouragementof arts in which there was the descriptionof the kite harry wrote down priestley'shistory of vision vols in which heparticularly wanted to read about thecamera obscura lucy wished to have thatbook of franklin's which she had beenlooking at the day they were at the electricalmachine or the sake of some letterswhich she had seen at the end of thevolume harry found the volume againreadily for lucy what she alluded towere enticed letters to a young lady onphilosophical subjects in one of whichthe author says to her your observationon what you have lately read concerninginsects is very just and solid superficialminds are apt to despise those who makethat part of the world their study as mereg triflers but certainly the world has beenvery much obliged to themlucy wished also for a little volumewhich she had seen in lady digby's bookcasecalled nourjahad the beginning ofwhich had excited her curiosity ladydigby consented though it was a veryfavourite book as it had been given to herbyher father when she was about lucy'sage she also lent her two very interestingaccounts of shipwrecks the lossof the winterton and the voyage ofthe alcestissir rupert's last kindness to harry andlucy was the lending and explaining tothem the use of a ientagraph an instalmentfor reducing maps or drawings drwollaston's camera lucida he promised toshow harry the next time he came to see himharry was very happy to hear thosewords the next timesir rupert expressed his desire to seehim and lucy again whenever their fatherand mother would bring them and it wassettled that they should spend anotherfortnight at digby castle making it theirway homeas lucy was listening most attentivelyto this interesting arrangement she wasstartled by the sound of a carriage shelooked out of the window and saw that itwas their own driving to the dooris it possible cried she i thoughtit was much earlier oh there is mammawith her bonnet on i did not think itwas near bonnettime yetbut alas it was come to that time andto that last moment when she must saygoodbyehow often they said goodbye it wouldbe impossible to recount we are sure ofonce in the drawingsroom once on thesteps of the house once on the steps ofthe carriage and again at the carriagewindow and a goodbye as they passedthe porter's lodge to the mother of astyanaxbut the present moment as usualpressed its claims to attention and had itsclaims allowed harry began to settlethe books in the carriage of their inconvenientarrangement in the moment offarewell none of the party had been fullysensible but now it hurt harry's mechanicalfeelings to see parcels sliding andslipping unable to stay in the places assignedthem as these were in direct oppositionto the laws of gravity he set aboutto alter their arrangement promising tomake it infinitely more convenient to everybodyhow inconvenient his elbows wereto his mother during this operation neednot be represented it will readily be conceivedby all who have ever been in acarriage with a settlerscarcely had harry packed the booksand lucy placed the great nosegay to hersatisfaction in one of the pockets of thecarriage than they began a comparison oftheir feelings during their visit at dig bycastlei have been very very happy saidlucy harry let me tell you all thethings which i liked and then you maytell me what you liked bestwhat he or what lucy liked best it wasdifficult to decide lucy seemed to thinkthat all was best i hope she added that lady digby's nephews and niecesmay be there at our next visit how happilywe shall play at hide and seek in theannulled apartments i know a placewhere you would not find me for a year ifi did not tell you up through the trapdoornear the little staircase leading tothat observatory which you have not yetseen i am to see the observatory and saturnand his ring next time said harry ifnext time ever comes ifs to be sure it will said lucy we have not seen half the park yet we shall have delightful walks with ladydigby she likes long rambling scramblingwalks harry is not she a nice woman no said harr i like her becauseshe is not iiceynot in the bad sense you mean notaver nice said lucyyes said harry i mean that sheis not one of those fine ladies who havealways fine shoes and who can never stirout of the house except on a fine day shehas strong shoes and has the use of herfeet and her hands and her head and knows where every thing can befound that is wanted said lucy andkeeps every thing in order yet does not plague every body saidharry by being too exact some peopletake every book off the tables the momentone leaves the room and put every thingout of the way which they call puttingthings hyt that would not suit sir rupert saidlucy he said he did not like the lookof any room where there were no books andno signs of people being comfortably employedi love the look of the library andthe drawingroom at digby castle verydifferent from newport hall a fine houseaunt pierrepoint took me to last year mydear harry you can have no idea howtiresome it was lady newport sat orlay on the sofa all day long without havingany thing in the world to do i suppose the poor woman was acripple said harryno she was not a cripple said lucy she could dance though she could notwalk but i suppose that some days shewas ill though she eat and drank likeother people every day yet it was alwayssaid that lady newport was so very delicate there was to be no wind in theroom and no noise all the companytalked in whispers but indeed that wasno loss for nobody ever said any thingworth hearing nobody laughed and nobodywas allowed to yawn excepting lordnewport himself he did yawn indeed and aunt pierrepoint was so cruel as tosend me to bed one evening for a fit ofyawning which i caught from him soi never looked at him aoairi in the eveningsi did not like looking at him atany time at breakfast he was so paleand miserable at dinner so red and cross and at night so stupid and sleepy ibelieve he was unhappy because he hadnever any thing to saybut many people are happy enoughwhen they have not any thing to say interruptedharry are they said lucy doubtinglyg certainly said harry men areoften happy when they say nothing forone i am sure i am often happiestwhen you yes interrupted lucy butthere is a great deal of difference betweensaying nothing and having nothing tosay besides lord newport not only hadnothing to say but nothing to do poorman with all his riches and his fine newcourthouseand newportpark he wasthe most unhappy person i ever saw nowi will make his face for you harryharry could not help laughing at lucy'simitation of lord newport's dull faceshe was going on mimicking his lordship'syawn and the manner in whichlady newport lolled on the sofa andher drawling affected voice but hermother stopped her by saying that sheadvised her not to acquire the habit ofmimickrythough it may be entertaining at themoment lucy it is dangerous it wouldmake you disliked and what is worsemight lead you to say and do what is illnaturedand for which you ought to bedislikedoh mamma i hope not said lucyi did not mean to be illnatured but icannot help seeing the difference betweenpeople who are sensible or agreeableand those who are stupid or affected ordisagreeable how can i help mammaseeing the difference between lord andlady newport with their ways of goingon at newporthouse and sir rupertand lady digby and their manner ofspending their time at digby castleyou would not wish mamma wouldyou that i should not perceive the differenceand that i should like them allequally certainly i should not my dear lucyanswered her mother i am very gladthat you can judge and distinguish whatit is in the characters and manners andhabits of those you see which makes themagreeable or disagreeable happy or miserableand i should be very sorry bywhat i say now to put any restraint uponyour expressing before me as wew as toyciur brother your natural feelings andopinionsoh mamma you need not fear thatsaid lucy i should never feel afraid tospeak before you you tell me so gentlyand kindly when you think me wrongnow harry stop me pray the next time ibegin to mimick anybody and do notlaugh because that encourages me i donot think i was quite right either mammain another thing which perhaps you didnot hear me say about aunt pierrepoint'sbeing so cruel as to send me to bed foryawning i should not have said thatbecause she was very kind to me and ishould be very sorry to be ungrateful ishould not have told the only little thingshe did that was unjustvery true my dear lucy and i amsure since you have this generous feelingthat i need say no more on the subjectmother said harry i am going toask you a question not on my own accountfor i cannot complain of anybodyhaving been unjust to me but when childrenhave been punished unjustly i wantto know how they can help recollectingthey cannot help recollecting it saidhis mother but they can prevent themselvesfrom talking or thinking of it bywhich means they will avoid fixing theimpression more strongly in the memory and if on the other hand they try to recollectthe kindness that has been shownto them they will avoid the danger whichlucy so justly dreads of becoming ungrateful yes mamma said lucy i recollecthearing of that ungrateful girl miss kittymaples who said her father interrupted her recollectionsand gently desired her to look out at aplace they were just passing let ustalk said he of things not of personshe stopped the carriage for a few minutesthat they might look at the buildingwhich was near the roadwhat a strange ugly looking houseexclaimed lucy it is neither a housenor a castle this was the mode of building saidher father which followed the time ofgothic castles in england when fortifiedcastles were no longer wanted for defencepeople began to build houses with wallsless thick and without the moat drawbridgeand portcullis they retained somethingof the old castle appearance by wayof grandeur or because they had beenused to it but this style of buildingwhich lucy dislikes appears now to beuseless and that is one reason i thinkwhy it looks ugly those blind towersfor instance in which there are neitherloopholes to shoot through with bow andarrow nor windows to light even a narrowstaircase are ridiculousa short time after this as they drovethrough a town they took notice of somevery old looking houses which seemed tobe built of wood they had projectingwindows which in the second story juttedout far into the street and others likechequered frames of black wood andwhite plastering on one of these they sawthe date such houses were commonas their father told them in the timesof elizabeth and jamesdid not we come through this townon our way to digby castle said lucyi wonder that i never took notice ofthese odd looking houses did youharry no said harry we were thinkingof something else i supposebut now said lucy that we haveseen that gothic castle and chapel andthat we have learnt a little about suchthink's we take more notice of other buildingsand we feel interested about themwhich is very pleasantas they went on a little further theymet some loaded timbercarriages and onone was a stone pillar which as one of thedrivers told them had been brought bywater from far off they were going toa nobleman's place near hand who isbuilding a fine house harry's fatherfound that by turning a little out of theirdirect road they could see it and heordered the postilion to drive that waywhen they arrived they got out of thecarriage to look at the building thescaffoldings were up and many workmenbusy at work but enough was finished forharry to see the style of architecture itwas grecian with a portico supported bydoric columns lucy said the front lookedvery like the print of a temple which theyhad seen the day before among the printsat digby castle she could not recollectthe name of it harry knew it was thetemple of minerva but it had anothername the parthenon the architect heardwhat they said and told them that thiswas built after the model of the parthenonhe then spoke of some new buildings inlondon and made use of several termswhich they did not understand but harryhad now seen and heard enough to makehim anxious to learn more on these subjects how much there is to learn saidhe in orettincr into the carriage not onlyabout building but about every thing from the greek word parthenope the virgin yes said lucy that puts me inmind of alps on alps arise harry doyou recollect thatalps on alps said harry whatcan you mean lucyshe began to repeat some wellknownlines of pope harry recollected them he had learned them from her some monthsbefore this time and he begged that shewould let him try if he could repeat themonly give me time said he when stop do not tell me the next word directlyvery well if you are out i will notput you in till i have counted a hundredand that surely will be time enough foryou to think and for me to be silent harry began boldly fired at first sight with what but with what or by what he was firedhe could not recollect lucy's hundredwas fairly counted and the last ten slowlytolled outhe observed that these first lines whichhe knew were something about the musehe had always found very difficult but thatif lucy would repeat four or five he knewhe could then go on cleverly lucy repeatedfired at first sight with what the muse impartsin fearless youth we tempt the height of artswhile from the hounded level of our mindshort views we take nor see the lengths behindstop interrupted harry here ismy difficulty i never could learn this byheart because i do not understand it norsee the lengths behind behind i thinkshould be before does not the authormean that in climbing the height of thearts we cannot see the length of way beforeus he does but the word behind is hereused in another sense what sense said harrywhy for instance answered lucyif you take away a little from what wehave to learn yet a great deal is leftbehind still there is a puzzle said harryas there always is when a word is usedthat has two senses we do not know inwhich to take itwell i cannot help it said lucylet me on you must not be so exactin poetry you will see by what is comingthat i am rightbut more advanc'd behold with strange surprisenew distant scenes of endless science risescience interrupted harry nowmy dear i can go on by myself so pleased at first the towering alps we trymount o'er the vales and seem to tread the sky th eternal snows appear already pastand the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attained we tremble to surveythe growing labours of the lengthen'd way th increasing prospect tires our wanting eyeshills peep o'er hills and alps on alps arisequite perfect said lucyand very well repeated said hismotherbecause i like these lines very muchsaid harry in this poetry there is somesense as well as sound added he itis true and it's pretty and its wise and it'switty my dear harry that is rhyme youwill be a poet at last cried lucy it will be a long time first said harryin the mean time here we are at home here is dame pelion's cottage and how well the roof looks papasaid lucy and there is dame peytoncoming out to welcome usmamma do not you think that porchwould be much prettier if it were coveredwith honeysuckle i will plant some theretomorrow or cuttings of clematis mammaor some quickgrowing climberit may be feared that after all the dissipation or if dissipation be not the properword all the amusement and variety theyhad enjoyed during this last fortnight atdigby castle harry and lucy might findit dull at rupert cottage it will befeared by those who best know the natureof boys that after the great excitement ofthe workshop and the laboratory withnovelties mechanical chemical electricaland aerial opening to his view every dayand hour harry would not be able tosettle soberly to his necessary employmentsand to plod on daily through the requisiteportions of greek latin and mathematicsit will and must be feared by all whoequally well know the nature of girls thatafter the polite praise and incessant attentionpaid to her by those two most uncommonlykind people sir rupert andlady digby lucy would droop like aplant suddenly removed from sunshine toshadeharry and lucy's father and mother hadtheir fears on these points undoubtedlyand with some reason as all fathers andmothers as well as masters and governesseswill confess those only excepted who havebeen blessed or cursed with the care ofearly prodigies of prudenceit should be remarked that a few wordssaid by sir rupert digby to both harryand lucy had operated on their minds toprepare them to watch over themselves ontheir return home he had shown thatuncommon degree of justice which considersnot only what is agreeable to youngpeople at the moment but what is to happenafterwards to them and to those whohave the everyday care of providing fortheir happinessyou know harry that if i were constantlyliving with you could not affordto give up to you so much of my time and i hope you will prove to your fatherand to yourself when you go home thati have done you no mischief lucy willi think follow your example whatever itmay be and this will be an additionalmotive for your assiduityharry had these words in his recollectionthe morning after he came home andwhen left entirely to himself in his ownroom he went to his mathematics firstand then finished his portion of greek andlatin before he tried the new glasses inhis camera obscura when lucy knewthis she could not for very shame go asshe had been desperately tempted to doto nourjahad instead of to arithmeticafter breakfast there was a new strugglein their minds harry was tempted bythe sight of the books of shipwrecks andwas attracted by the titles in large charactersof the loss of the alcestis and ofthe winterton and a page on which sheopened in nourjahad describing the goodgenius crowned with flowers was almostirresistible to lucyit will be an evil genius to you lucysaid her mother for if once it catcheshold of you it will keep you from everythingelse of this i warn you for i havemyself felt the power of that genius ourduties must be done first and then pleasurescan be enjoyed in comforti understand you mamma said lucy there i have put away nourjahadbut look at harry deep in the midst ofthe shipwrecks though he advised me notto touch the booksharry threw down the winterton andran off to his businesslucy had undertaken to make a frockfor dame peyton's grandchild but tobay the truth it had been a oncr timeabout and was in danger of becoming asyellow as certain indian muslin dresseswhich the black servants who are employedto embroider them for their mistresseswind round their waists and trailabout the house for months working atthe flower or the leaf in the intervals ofdomestic employments lucyss frock wasan example of beautiful running andequally beautiful backstitching with onelittle border of satin stitch smooth as anysave that which parisian fingers can performher mother nowe reminded her thatit ought to be completed as the christeningof the child was fixed for the next sundaythere was one row of backstitching yetto be done backstitching as every bodyknows is desperately tiresome but whatwill not hearty good will aided by a littlegood sense and a little good example accomplishharry has done all he promisedthought lucy and so will l mammashall see that i am not spoiled by all theamusement we had at digby castle sothinking and acting accordingly she completelyfinished her work and held it upbefore her mother's approving eyesit happened that harry and lucy wereto spend that evening at home by themselvestheir father and mother havinggone to drink tea with the good old vicarat a few miles distance they had manypleasant things to do lucy in the firstplace went to try her frock on the babythe joy that appeared in dame peyton'seyes overpaid lucy for the labour of thework the baby was asleep in the cradlebut the grandame without ceremony tookit up to array it in its new vestments andwhile harry was out digging the borderready for the cuttings of honeysuckle andclematis round the porch the grandmotherand lucy had leisure to admire how prettythe child looked in its christening robethe dame only wished that its motherwere at home to see it but the motherwas gone to digby castle to visit her husbandwho was a footman thereharry came into the cottage just to letvol iv hlucy know that lie had dug the border forher and must now run off to finish a jobof his own some steps which he wasmaking to a bathingplace near damepeyton's

danger ofher not keeping this promise when shehad such a book as nourjahad to readshe read and read on at last pausing at agood restingplace just where nourjahadsinks into his second hundred years sleeplucy looked round her and saw thelengthened shadows of the evening therewas within view of her seat a projectingpoint of rock whose shadow harry hadalways consulted as his dial lucy nowlooked at its long dark form upon thewater and said to herself it must be growing late very late i wonder harry is not comeshe stood up and looked along thepath no harry nothing was to be seenshe considered what could have kept himso long perhaps some of the steps were wrongsaid she to herself and he has stayed toalter them i have a mind to go and see but no he begged that i would be patientand particularly desired me to stay for himhereshe took up her book again and readon a little further but with divided interestevery now and then looking up tosee whether he was coming at lengthunable to

and hisface is not burned miss that i am clearsure of for i saw it quite plain as heturned his head back over his father'sshoulder beckoning to me and sent meoff with his love to you miss and to begyou would not be frightened which hadnot time to tell youlucy ran on while the boy was sayingthis she felt as if she could not get onfast do what she would at last she reachedthe house and made her way through thepeople who were standing in the passageshe tried softly to open the door of hermother's room where she heard that harrywas but it was fastened her father fromwithin opened it inquiring eagerly if amessenger he had sent to the apothecary'sin the village had returnedhere he comes said lucy with abottle in his handher father seized the bottle asking ifthe surgeon was comingno he was gone to a patient ten milesoff and would not be back till morningher father had not seen lucy but shecaught hold of his arm and asked if shemight see harry yes you can help your mother butcan you command yourself lucy donot come in if you cannot i can i will said lucy onlytell me what i can do for him and throwingoff her bonnet and gloves she wentin it was worse than she expected whenshe heard groans from harry who borepain so well she knew he must sufferdreadfully going nearer she saw himlying on his side the arm down to theelbow covered with hue white blistersor in some places raw and of a fiery redhis whole frame writhing about in agony lucy could not help shrinking at thissight but she made no exclamation shelooked at her mother to inquire what couldbe done her mother was wetting somesoft linen rags with spirits of turpentinewhich her father poured out of thebottle these were gently laid on theinflamed parts of the arm taking greatcare not to break the blisters lucy couldscarcely bear to see it done the firsttouches gave harry such torture even withallhis mother's care and delicacy of handshe was now desired to take her mother'splace and to keep the linen on harry'sarm and shoulder wet with the turpentinelucy's hands trembled when she beganbut they soon became more steady theconsciousness that what she was doingwould relieve her brother gave her courageto her unspeakable satisfaction his groansbecame less frequent in a few minuteshis features which had been all drawnup came to themselves and opening hiseyes for a moment he looked up at lucyand said thank you dear lucyhis father and mother were employedin melting basilicon ointment and minorit with the oil of turpentine in a smallsaucepan a process that required greatcaution to prevent the vapour of that veryinflammable oil from taking fire thispreparation was now ready his motherwith a soft feather smeared it over thewhole surface of the wound and thenspread the rest of it on a large rag whichshe gently laid over all scarcely was theoperation finished when harry's head sunkupon his pillow and he dropped asleep this was in about fifteen minutes from thefirst application of the turpentinelucy left the room by her mothersdesire to go to bed and as she wasmoving very softly through the passageshe found dame peyton sitting there waitingfor some account of harry when sheheard that he was easy and asleep shewent away repeating h bless him god bless lii for some days harry was so feverishthat the surgeon had forbidden all conversationin his room but at last he wasallowed to talk a little and lucy beingmost anxious to hear how the accident hadhappened she said i left you harrywhen you were going to work at the stepsgo on from thathe had been at work he said verybusily finishing those steps and growingwarm had thrown off his coat when suddenlyobserving a great light over the treesnear dame peyton's cottage he went upthe bank and saw flames coming from theroof he ran on to the house the housedoorwas locked he knocked and calledin vain but hearing the cries of the childhe broke the fastening of a latticewindowand sprung into the kitchen thick smokealmost blinded him he knew howeverthat it was in the lite parlour and feelingalong the wall he was partly guided byits cries till these were overpowered byloud yells which burst out in some placeover his head he found the parlourdoorbut it stuck so fast that he could notpush it open he heard the rustling ofthe flames he pushed again with all hisforce and the door gave way firelightnow glared upon him from the roof harrysaw the cradle at the opposite side of theroom he snatched up the infant andmade his way back through the suffocatingsmoke and pieces of blazing thatch whichwere now falling he put the infant outfirst in jumping after it he perceivedsomething on fire about himself and whenhe came into the air he found his shirtsleevein a blaze he threw himself on theground in hopes to extinguish the flame but as fast as he extinguished it in oneplace it appeared in another no helpwas near the pain was intense this was all harry could tell of whathad happened till he awakened again ashedescribed it and heard a confusion ofvoices and found himself in his fathersarmsdame peyton had come morning noonand night to inquire how he was and verymuch wished to see him he was nowable in lucy's opinion and in his own tosee her and lucy admitted both the dameand the mother of the child who wereanxiously waiting at the door the mothersoftly approached his bedside with herinfant in her arms judiciously consideringthat no sight could be more gratifying toharry their thanks were silent thetears came into their eyes as they lookedat him and dame peyton uttered one lowand fervent god bless him not aword more even harry with his horrorof flattery and dread of being thankedwas pleased especially when the infantstretched out its little arms towards himand smiledharry asked if they had found out whatthe yells came from which he had heardin the loftthe dame told him that they came from her cat which had been burned there withits kittenshe then wished to know if the whole ofthe new roof had been burned and how ithad caught fire yes the roof was all burned but notmuch other damage had been done howthe house first took fire no one could tellbetsy declared that all was safe when shewent out no clothes nothing left nearthe fireplace and the fire was very lowas far as they could judge the fire hadbroken out in the loftharry thought that perhaps the chimneymight have some crack in it but no it hadbeen examined and dame peyton repeatedthat it was most extraordinary that a fireshould break out in a loft when nobodyhad been in it or so much as up the stairswhich led to it for two days before ofthis betsey and she were certain nocreature had been up there except the cat as lucy observed itjust occurred to her that the dame's favouritetabby cat had been the cause of allthe mischief lucy recollected to haveoften seen her lying in the ashes almostunder the grate she thought it possiblethat tabby lead gone up to her kittens inthe loft with a bit of cinder sticking toher which might have set fire to thestraw in which she and her kittens weredivinothis seemed very likely to all but damepeyton alio could not bear that the blameshould be brought home to her poor deartabby jn zeal for the memory of the bestof cats dame peyton forgot the undertoneproper to a sick room and she wasin loud demonstration of the impossibilityof that which probably had happened whenthe door opened and the surgeon enteredthe room was cleared instantly evenlucy notwithstanding her protestations ofinnocence and promises perpetual silencefound herself in the passage and the doorclosed against herthe surgeon pronounced that harry hadstill much fever and he found that thoughthe burn was rapidly healing yet his patientcould not raise himself nor turn inhis bed without much pain upon furtherexamination the surgeon discovered thatharry had received a severe strain theconsequences of which might he said bevery serious he feared that it would benecessary for harry to continue confinedto an horizontal position for some time how long sir said harry in anintrepid toneas far as the surgeon could guess itwould probably be some weeks beforeharry could walk he might attempt itsooner but if he did it would be at a greatrisk on the contrary if he submittedquietly and steadily to this confinement inall human probability he would perfectlyrecover and be as well and active as everthe moment he was convinced of thereason and necessity of the case harrywas perfectly submissive and better thansubmissive resolute to bear and forbearwhatever was prescribed when the surgeonhad left the room harry looking upand seeing his mother's anxious eyes fixedupon him smiled and said do not beafraid or me or of me mother you shallsee how good and how well i shall be afew weeks will soon be over and thoughi am to lie fiat i may use my hands andarms i suppose as soon as my burn iswell and i can read and entertain myselfand what is better i shall have lucy toread to me and talk to me you need notpity me mother i am not to be pitied atall was not it very fortunate that i wasthere and in time to save the child thinkof the delight i felt when i got it safe outof the window and the joy of hearing itsquall again of being certain it was alive i am sure that and the pleasure i havejust had in seeing the mother and child andthe old woman too are enough to pay mefor all the surgeon you know said wemight thank god it was no worse and ithank god it is so well think motherof my having been the means of saving afellowcreature i am sure i do with allmy heart and soul thank godafter all this excitement his nurseswisely left him to repose he fell into asound sleep how long he might haveslept none can tell for he was wakenedmuch to lucy's provocation by a loudknock at the halldoor it was sir rupertdigby not he surely that gave thethundering knock no that was his fool ofa groom for even wise men sometimeshave foolish groomssir rupert digby was allowed to comeinto harris room and lucy was struckby the melancholy expression of his countenancewhich did not clear up whenharry's own cheerful voice assured himthat he now suffered but little and that hehoped to be quite well in a few weeks andable to go to digby castle at these wordssir rupert shook his head sorrowfullyand said we shall not be there to meet youmy dear we are obliged to set out immediatelyfor the continentone of lady digby s nieces as theyhad heard this morning had been takendangerously ill and they were going toher this was a farewell visit from sirrupert lady digby could not come she was too busy and too unhappyharry and lucy were very sorry butthey were not so selfish as to think muchof their own little disappointment andharry was grateful to sir rupert for thinkingof him at such a time sir ruperthad indeed thought of every thing thatcould contribute to harry's ease and comfortin his absence and now offered thekey of his library and the use of his printsand instruments which were most gladlyacceptedsir rupert promised not only to write toharry's father but to harry himself ifhe should see any thing on the continentthat he thought might amuse or instructhimfarewell harry said he may godbless you and keep alive in your mindthe benevolent feelings you possess andthe noble desire to improve the facultieswith which he has endowed youduring some succeeding days harry'spulse and his own account of himselfwere at perpetual variance he assertingthat he was well quite well while hispulse pronounced morning and eveningthe reverse the surgeon preferred thereport of the pulse and harry bound byhis wise resolutions was obliged to submitto doctor diet and doctor quiet and tohave nothing yet to do with lucy's favouritedoctor merryman harry wasneither to talk or to be talked to neitherto read or to be read to neither to entertainor be entertained lucy with a facebecoming the most discreet of little nursessat by his bedside knitting for him futurecomfortable or went about in silence butnever on tiptoe for that harry detested he always wakened when any one went ontiptoe but moving quietly yet withoutany appearance of constraint she freedhim from the fear of keeping her prisonerin about a fortnight his arm healed butfrom the effects of the strain he was stillobliged to be a prisoner upon the sofa for some hours lying as required quiteflat at others raised from that tiresomehorizontal penance to a position whichwith all the advantage of rest restored himto the use of hands arms and eyes thisprivilege he owed to the kindness of hisfriend sir rupert who in passing throughlondon saw and sent him abed invaluableto all in his conditionthe first day it came harry begged thatit might be placed in his view so that hemight examine its construction he sawthat the bedstead was hinged in the middleand that either end could be sloped to anyangle that was desired and firmly fixedthere by a supporting frame just as lucysaid like her music desk there werevarious other contrivances which delightedharry first as a mechanic and then as aninvalid he had himself raised and loweredtill he found the angle which was mosteasy and convenient then lucy wasemployed to make a pasteboard quadrantand to fasten it on the side of the bedframeso that he could most accuratelyas she said signify to her his inclinations you must allow me that pun harryhe allowed it to her in consideration ofher welldivided quadrant to say thetruth the quadrant was found of little useit was easier to say put me up to thethird notch or to the fifth notch as thecase might require but it is natural toingenious people especially when youngto make use of superfluous inventions uponcommon occasionslucy more than ever rejoiced at havingacquired some taste for harry's pursuits because as she had been his best littlenurse when he was sick so now she couldbe his most agreeable companion when hewas recoveringestablished on this most convenient ofbeds his next object was to add to it areading and writingdesk which in itskind he determined should be as perfectas the bed sundry trials were madesundry ways and at last a desk was contrivedby harry and executed by the carpenterwhich was perfectly firm and yetremoveable at a moment's warning cedingits place to the dinner breakfast or teatrayit is but justice to harry to mentionthat before he thought of all these conveniencesin his own establishment he hadbeen intent upon getting the roof repairedfor dame peytonsir rupert had placed his carpenterunder harry's orders and had agreed tohis request that the house was now to beslated harry looked at his old plan againand with his father's concurrence madesome improvements in this second editionof his roof when the ingenious and admirablemachinery of mr brunei was afew years ago burnt to the ground hereplied to a letter of condolence that hefound sufficient consolation in the hopes ofmaterially improving itas soon as the surgeon's permission wasobtained harry had great enjoyment inthe books which his mother brought forhim from digby castle among these werescott's poetical works harry formerlythought he had no taste for poetry butnow when his mother read to herr thebeginning of the lay of the last minstrelhe felt surprised at being so much pleasedwith it as much even as lucy his motherhaving refused to let him hear more thanone canto the first evening he looked forwardwith eagerness to the time whenreading was to recommence this nowappeared the most delightful hour of thewhole day and but for the shame of notallowing his mother time to take breathlucy and he would willingly have listenedto canto after canto and poem after poemfrom the lay of the minstrel to thelord of the islesbut his mother managed their pleasuresso that they not only lasted the longer butwere relished the more keenly not swallowedwithout being tasted lucy hadthis art yet to learn mamma said she i think you aretoo careful not to tire him with readingi think he cannot have too much entertainmentit is only the stupid parts of bookswhich tire one all that is necessary isto pick out the plums and to have avariety he would i think be soon tired ofplums my dear said her mother anda great variety would weary him stillmorewell mamma whispered lucy willyou let us try the experiment i shouldlike to see whether he could be tired ofplums i will pick out what i know helikes best and never give him too muchof one thing at a time you will seemammatry my dear and you will see saidher motherharry had now recovered sufficiently toresume some of his usual employmentsand he begged lucy one day to bringeuclid that he might take his morninghalfhour at geometry before they did anythingelse lucy was of opinion that heought not yet to read any thing so veryserious when the surgeon came lucyextorted a similar opinion from him andtherefore determined next day to try herexperiment accordingly at the hourwhich harry had set apart for his mathematicsshe stole in softly behind him andwhile in the midst of the square of thehypothenuse she laid beside him a finelarge butterfly who in the most obligingmanner rested there with outspread wings i will look at it in one instant saidharry as lucy called upon him to admirethe beautiful purple eyes on the wings only just wait one moment till i cometo the q e dbut as he spoke the butterfly made alittle motion as if preparing to risetake care that it does not fly awaycried harrythere is no danger said lucyin another instant before harry cameto his q e d the butterfly made a suddenjump up and alighted upon harry's handhe started when he felt its cold tail andbony body it was no butterfly but a sortof skipjack lucy had been at workpainting the wings from sunrise and forall the labour bestowed on the feathertincturedhead and proboscis she wasoverpaid by this start of harry's emboldenedby her first success this morningshe closed euclid decidedly and drew itfrom harry's handsharry said she for the rest of thisday you shall have nothing but plums andhave plenty in store for you of all sortsyou will not i hope be above feasting onsuch pretty and good ones as i have herevol iv ifor you and she laid down a basket fullof books in each of which there werevarious paper marksi am not above any thing good orpretty said harry but i think it is tooearly in the morning if you begin nowyou will scarcely be able to supply me allday longtry and we shall see as mammasaysbesides continued harry i thinkplums all day long would make any bodysickno no said lucy you shall havesuch variety only trust to me giveme leave to entertain you all this dayharry will you let those who have tried the experimentsay which has the hardest part he whoundertakes to entertain or to be entertainedall day long lucy had made agood beginning however having got rid ofeuclid with her butterfly from her butterflyshe went on to the butterfly's balland the grasshopper's feast and the delightful peacock at home by somestrange chance harry had not yet becomeacquainted with them mamma told me said lucy thatthis little book has had the honour of beingquoted by a great man in the house ofcommons these are the lines he repeatedfor birds are like men in their contests togetherand in questions of right can dispute for a featherbut there is the breakfast bell saidlucy interrupting herself i must gofor your breakfast having set it beforehim in order due now i must leaveyou for a few minutes while i eat my own but i shall soon return to feed you withplums upon her return lucy broughtup the newspaper which contained an extractof a letter from sir thomas stamfordraffles late governor of sumatra givinganaccount of the loss of the ship fame afterdescribing the alarm excited by the cry offire and the hurry with which ladyraffles and her children were thrust into aboat he says i ail this passed much quicker than i can writeit we pushed off as the flames were issuing fromour cabins the masts and sails now taking fire wemoved to a distance sufficient to avoid the immediateexplosion but the flames were coming out of the mainhatchway and seeing the rest of the crew with thecaptain c still on board we pulled back to the shipas we approached we perceived that the people weregetting into a boat we hailed her have youall on board yes all save one johnsonsick in his cot can we save him noimpossible at this moment the poor fellowscorched i imagine by the flames roared out mostlustily having run upon deck i will go for himsays the captain he pulled under the bowsprit ofthe ship and picked the poor fellow up all livessafe thank god pull off from the ship we thenhauled the boats close to each other and found thecaptain fortunately had a compass our only chancealas to regain bencoolen and the captain undertookto lead no possibility being left that we could againapproach the ship for she was now one splendidflame fore and aft and aloft her masts and sails in ablaze and rocking to and fro the alarm had beengiven about twenty minutes past eight and in lessthan ten minutes she was in flames there was not asoul on board at half past eight and in ten minutesafterwards she was one grand mass of firewithout a drop of water or a grain of food or arag of covering except what we happened at thatmoment to have on our backs we had embarked onthe wide ocean thankful to god for his mercies poorsophia having been taken out of her bed had nothingon but a wrapper neither shoes nor stockings oneof the children had been snatched out of his bedafter the flames had attacked it in short there wasnot time for any one to think of more than twothings can the ship be saved no let ussave ourselves then all else was swallowed up inone great ruin the ship continued to burn tillabout midnight when the saltpetre of which shehad tons on board took fire and sent up one ofthe most splendid and brilliant flames that was everseen illumining the horizon to an extent of not lessthan fifty miles and casting that kind of blue lightover us which is of all others most luridly horriblerain now came on but fortunately it was notof long continuance and the night became sereneand starlight the men behaved manfully theyrowed incessantly and never did poor mortals lookoutmore anxiously for daylight and for land than wcdid not that our sufferings were any thing to whathas often befallen others about two o'clock welanded safely and no words of mine can do justice tothe expression of sympathy and kindness with whichwe were hailed by every one if any proof bad beenwanting that my administration had been satisfactoryhere we had it unequivocally from all there wasnot a dry eye and as we drove back to our formerhome loud was the cry of god be praised the property which i have lost on the most moderateestimate cannot be less than cf butthe loss which have to regret beyond ail is mjpapers and drawings including my notes and observationswith memoirs and grammars dictionariesand vocabularies and a grand map of sumatra onwhich i had been employed since my first arrival herethis however was not all all my collections in naturalhistory and my splendid collection of drawingsupwards of a thousand in number and to concludei will merely notice that there was scarce an unknownanimal bird beast or fish or an interestingplant which we had not on board a living tapiranew species of tiger splendid pheasants c call domesticated for the voyage we were in short aperfect noah's ark all all has perished but thankgod our lives have been spared and we do not repineharry was as much interested by thisas lucy had expected he admired theactivity and courage displayed by thesesufferers during the moment of dangerand observed to his sister that the kindnesswith which sir stamford was welcomedon shore showed what a good governorhe had been he looked again atthe account and while lucy and he wereconsidering for which of the losses theywere most sorry lucy exclaimed harka knock at the door that is to tell me thatmy magnum bonum plum is ready andyou shall have itshe opened the door and received fromthe hands of the servant harry's cameraobscura in which with her father's assistanceshe had fixed the new glass lucyhad prepared every thing she had a standready so that harry could see and enjoyit completely he did enjoy it as much asshe could have expected his eye was fixedupon the landscape which he saw beforehim and he admired the quiet cattle slowlymoving on the paper and the winding pathand the fresh green trees with their lightboughs dancing in the sunshinewhile harry was looking at them andconsidering what he saw before him lucyexclaimed i know what you are thinkingof harry of the coloured shadows weused to see on the wall of our room athomeshe darted out of the room and returnedwith a quarto volume nowharry cried she for blue shadows andgi'een black shadows and red i willread you all about themshe sat down and read it is rather remarkable that so curiousan appearance as this of blue shadowsshould pass unnoticed near a century andshould then be hit upon by mere accidentbuffon as he was busy about somethingelse observed that the shadows of treeswhich fell upon a white wall were greenhere lucy read a curious but long accountof his observations upon green andindigo shadows seen in different circumstancesending with any person may seea blue shadow if he will only hold hisfinger before a piece of white paper at sunriseor sunsetharry said he should like to try this is it not all very entertaining askedlucyvery said harry but is there notsome explanation given what is thecause of the different colours of these shadowsthere is a oreat deal about it in thisbook replied lucy and the history ofa great many experiments which differentpeople have triedlet me see said harry stretchingout his hand for the bookno no said lucy they would betoodifficult for you c besides theywould not be plums and you are to havenothing else today i will put a mark inthe place for you and you may study colouredshadows another time luc then turned over the pages quicklyto find a favourite anecdote about a poorold woman who lived at montpelier butinher search for the old woman she wasstopped on her way by an account of aprodigious rainbow lying on the groundits colours almost as lively as any ever seenin the heavens she chased the rainbowinto a chapter infinitely too deep for hercomprehension and found herself in themidst of single double and treble bowsand inverted bows in company with sirisaac newton and bernoulli one minutethe next with m bouguer on the mountainsof peru or dr halley in chestertill neither she nor harry could tell whereshe was she abandoned her chase of therainbow but she stumbled upon her longlooked for old woman of montpelier u and what of her said harry hasshe anything to say to the rainbownothing in the world my dear saidlucy quite another thing she hadbought a piece of meat one day in themarket and hung it up in her bed roomdirty old woman said harrypoor old woman said lucy and atnight a very hot night it was she saw onthis meat which was hanging opposite tothe foot of her bed what do you thinka bright light so bright as to illuminate thewall the next day this luminous meatwhich she thought was bewitched wascarried to henry bourbon duke of contethe governor of the place who viewed itwith astonishment for some hours some lours harry thought that wastoo much though he would gladly havebeen allowed to pause upon it for a fewminutes the light as he guessed wasphosphoric and he reminded lucy of ashining light which they had once seen inthe shell of a decayed lobster but lucyrapidly turned over to a new page with anaccount of some experiments which boyletried on phosphoric substances placed inthe airpump then she went on to astory of doctor beale's cook who wasboiling some mackarel and saw the fishand the water shining as if on fire andthe children of the family diverting themselvesby running about the house withthe luminous drops which were as large aspennypieces think of that harryshe then ran on to father bourse'svoyage to the east indies during whichhe noticed a wonderful luminous appearancein the sea by which he could read inthe niohtharry wished to know whether it proceededfrom putrescent substances or fromluminous insects he asked lucy if sherecollected having heard a captain in thenavy a friend of his father's say that hehad brought to enoland and driven to sirjoseph banks some luminous animalsthree inches long which he had taken upfrom the southern ocean and which oaveso strong a light diet he could read a verysmall print by one of them which he hadput in a bucket of salt waterlucy could not spare time to answer she wanted to read what would entertainingas she hoped j more than asylum nous i insectsthe bologna stone harry did youever hear of this stone which gives lightin the dark and she read on for somepages till she recollected quite a differentthing which she was sure would amuseharry still more and throwing aside thatbook she took up a description of theesquimaux houses built of blocks of snowwith wellturned domes and with windowsof thin ice this interested harry verymuch but as lucy thought that he beganto look a little tired she hurried him outof the house of snow and read some anecdotesof the esquimaux lady illiglukwho understood maps and drew charts sowell but whose head not being able tobear the praises of the english sailors shebecame so conceited and affected that shecould do nothing but sit in her chair ondeck practising her airslucy again changed to something newand travelled from the north pole to chiliand from chili to ali pacha and read theaccount of his delight in seeing ice madein an air pump which had been sent outto him from europe and in this mannershe went on almost all the morning flyingfrom one book to another whenever shethought she saw fatigue in harry's faceshe turned to a fresh subject still fancyingthat by variety of entertainment she shouldrevive his attention and please him moreand more but at last observing his headresting on his hand she stopped short andsaid oh harry does your head acheharry confessed it was beginning to achea littlei am very very sorry said lucy why did you not tell me sooner that youwere tired i did not know it till my head beganto ache said harryi thought i was amusing you all thetime said lucy you told me that everythingi read was very entertainingso each thing was said harry feelingsfor her disappointment but altogetherthey my dear harry say no more saidlucy sorrowfully and settling his cushionsshe added there lay down your poorhead now and i will go away to mammaharry was so much worn out that lucywas not allowed to see him all the rest ofthe morning and as she wished her mothergood night she said i see you werequite right mamma i tired harry withplums long before the end of the day my dear harry how do you do thismorning said lucy coming in with atimid step and contrite look very well cried harry briskly perfectlywell thank you you have no reason to thank me saidlucy for giving you the head achebut my head ache is gone now and itwas a good experiment after all a bad experiment for you i thinkbut good for me said lucy for now iam convinced for life that plums all daylong will never do let them be ever sosweet and well picked that mine werewell picked you will acknowledge harrydid you sleep well yes said harry and wakened thismorning as fresh as ever and then i spentmy time very happily in thinkingthat is what i do sometimes when iwaken early said lucy and i think ofa hundred different things till i do notknow what i am thinking of and fallasleep again was that the way no said harry that was not theway with me for i was thinking only ofone thingwhat was that v asked lucyharry hesitated i should like to tellyou lucy but perhaps it might vex youoh no said lucy you cannotvex me i am sure well then i was considering why iwas so much tired yesterday and i think ihave found it out shall i tell youa cloud passed over lucy's brow atthis moment her mother came in withharry's breakfast do you thinkmamma said lucy there could be anyuse in harry's going all over what passedyesterday to tell me how i tired him somuch you know i am quite convincedof my mistakei am sure of that said harry butthere were many reasons why i was sotired i did not know them all myself till ithought over the whole affair this morningand it may be of use to you to know themi do not see much use said lucywhat do you say mamma i say that harry had better eat hisbreakfast first and that afterwards as theobject of a kind sister and good nursemust be to entertain without fatiguing yourpatient youhad better listen to his reasonswell mamma said lucy as i dowish to be a good nurse i will ask him forthem as soon as he has done breakfastaccordingly the breakfast being dispatchedharry began with the comfortablewords i will be as short as lean inthe first place you know that my mind cannotturn short round like a craneneckedcarriage whenever and wherever youplease yours can lucy therefore itwas more difficult to me than it was to youto turn so frequently from one thing toanother from coloured shadows to luminousinsects and from the old woman atmontpelier to ali pacha but besidesthis i was continually disappointed andyou know lucy disappointment tiresoh yes i allow that said lucy ifelt tired yesterday myself the moment iwas disappointed in my hopes of entertainingyou but how were you disappointedand continually too what do youmean i mean that when my interest was excitedby any thing you read to me i wasdisappointed in not having time to understandit completelyi know it would have tired mc muchmore said lucy if i had been obliged tostudy every thing to the end of the chapteri think not said harry i thinklucy we are always better satisfied whenwe get to the bottom of one thing beforewe fly off to another i am afraid that is not always my casesaid lucy but at all events it would nothave been good for you to have gone onwith euclid all day longprobably not said harry but ihave still another reason for you all thetime you were reading i was anxious andi am sure anxiety tires as much as disappointment but what anxiety had you askedlucy i was anxious not to be tired whileyou were trying all you could to entertainme and the more i wished this the moreweary i grew'and that was the very thing saidlucy that made me hurry on from onething to another for i thought sometimesyou looked fatigued but still harry yousee it was not the plums alone you weretired because you were disappointed andanxiousyes said harry but the plums inthemselves would have been too much intimeone grows tired of being entertainedwould it then mend the matter to readtiresome things between the entertainingones said lucy i am not sure but it would repliedharry lucy laughed i mean continuedharry if the tiresome things areworth reading for tiresome things oftenleave useful impressions behind them besidesthere is a pride in getting throughthem and if there is any difficulty we havethe pleasure of successi agree to that said lucy a littlesuccess or a little bit of praise refreshesme very much and i think harry youwill allow that you are not tired now fori am sure you have got to the bottom ofthis subjectharry was this day to arrange his occupationsand amusements in his own waywhile lucy went out to her garden he appliedto euclid for half an hour that hemight as he said earn an appetite for astory which he knew lucy had in store forhim nourjaliad he stopped her atnourjahad's first sleep of a hundred yearsat a moment when he was very curious toknow what would come next what wouldhappen when he awakened then he wentto a translation of a passage in euripideswhich he said he would prepare for his fatherafter working at that for some time heamused himself with the shipwreck of thewinterton in which he was much interested but his father coming in an hourwas spent between greek and englishtolerably successfully and therefore withoutfatigue the next hour was spent intrying to complete an invention which hehad long had in contemplation lucy wentto her own affairs while he was thus occupiedand promised to return in half anhour but at the end of this time when sheappeared he told her she might stay awayanother half hour and then she foundhim looking very much tired for he hadnot been successful in his invention andhe had persisted in thinking of it toolong he was however refreshed by somemore of nourjahad in which he was veryhappily engaged when lucy was summonedby the sound of the dressing bell looking at each other they both exclaimed so soonwe cannot pretend to say that on thefollowing days harry was always equallysuccessful in arranging his occupations sothat labour and rest should equal periodskeep much greater philosophersthan he daily fail in this attempt andharry it seems was not always so great aphilosopher as he thought himself thoughhe had been very grand in resisting thetemptation of reading too much of nourjahad at once yet one day temptationcame which he could not resist in the formof baron trench's memoirs lucy beganto read it to him after his morning's mathematics but after reading an hour sheobserved that it was time to go to her gardenharry intreated her to go on half anhour longer if she was not tired notin the least said lucy i am onlyafraid of tiring you half an hour anhour longer she went on and then she lefthim to repose but no repose could harrytake he was so anxious to know whetherthe first hole that baron trench made inhis dungeon wall was discovered by hisjailor he eyed the book which lucy hadleft on the table as she thought out ofhis reach but with the aid of a pair oflazy tongs he drew the tempting volumeto him and never stopped till it wasfinished lucy coming in he asked hervoraciously for the second volume shewas astonished at his having already devouredthe first and demurred but soonyielded to his imploring emphasis on thepersuasive little word do let me haveit my dear li short the whole day wasspent upon it when he had finished hefelt as if there was a universal blank in theworld nothing could interest him afterthis strong stimulus and in the eveninghe was obliged acknowledge that he wasvery much tired indeedlucy demurely observed and harry readilyagreed with her that we may tireourselves as much by going on too longwith one entertaining thing as by flyingabout to a varietyit must be said on behalf of harry thathis confinement to the sofa rendered itsomewhat difficult for him to get throughthe day without fatigue of mind becausehe was debarred from that kind of labourof body which we call exercise and whichis found most useful in restoring the freshnessof the spirits lucyss power ofmaking him laugh had been often found thebest substitute for bodily exertion and sheagain satisfactorily proved that laughterholding both his sides takes and givesexercise in the most salutary mannermamma said lucy when they haddone laughing it was very well worthwhile to listen that day to harry s reasonsi have not tired him so much sincenever cried harry indeed shehas always hindered me from tiring myselfand do you know mamma continuedlucy he can do much more in the daynow than he could before because wehave arranged it rightlyharry observed that they had beenobliged to try a great many experimentsbefore they had brought things to thishappy conclusion you see mamma said lucy thatharry must have experiments some way orother and now that he has neither balloonsor workshop or laboratory and cannotstir from his sofa he is reduced to try themon his own mind or on mineand that is very convenient saidharry for we have all we want for thepurpose in ourselves mother do not youthink it is useful very useful my dear for by thesemeans you may learn to command yourown mind while at the same time you areacquiring some insight into the minds ofothers and by judiciously arranging youroccupations you may not only get moredone in the same period but you maystrengthen quicken and enlarge all thepowers of your understandingharry was now well enough to be broughtout into the common sitting room hissofa had lahore castors which moved soeasily that lucy without any help couldroll him from room to room one eveningshewas admiring these castors and harrywho had not failed to examine their constructionundertook to explain to her on whattheir excellence depended he told her thatin common castors the upright pin roundwhich they turn is so short that it has nosupport being only just long enough torivet through the lower plate of thebrass socket but that in these castors thepin is five or six inches long and taperedto the upper end which is made to play inalittle iron thimble let into the leo of thesofa so that you see lucy the longpin is always kept in its place and as itturns round with very little friction it allowsthe wheel to take at once the direction inwhich the leg is movingfather remarked that castors on thesame principle were now sold as a recentinvention by the name of french castorsthough a print of a similar contrivance isto be found in a dutch book on windmillsprinted above a hundred years ago invol iv kthis trivial circumstance harry is an exampleof what i have often observed toyou that the same things are inventedin different countries by people who haveno communication with each other simplybecause the same wants are felt and becausethe same progress has been made inknowledge indeed these very castorswere invented and used by a friend of minein this kingdom thirty years ago and yeti can readily believe that some frenchmanmay have again re invented them stillmore latelybut if your friend invented them firstsaid harry i think it is wrong that theyshould be called french castorsit is not worth while for nations or individualsto dispute about such trifles mydear boy said his father no persons whohave much invention are meanly anxiousto contest on every petty occasion theirclaims to originality their feeling is better invent something new than disputeabout the pasthere the conversation was interruptedby tke arrival of a lady who was to drinktea with them when tea was over sheproduced from her workbag a little manuscriptbook containing a collection ofriddles and charades which she had broughtfor harry's amusement lucy liked thembecause she found them out quicklyharry was uncommonly slow and unsuccessfulin his attempts even hints intendedto help him invariably set him morewrong he soon came to pray tell meand when told he could not always understandthe explanations they appearedmore difficult than the riddles themselvesespecially when both lucy and the lady wereexplaining them to him at once and in differentways however he was so goodhumoured and afforded so much diversionby his strange guesses and extraordinarymisapprehensions that their visitor as sheclosed her book declared that for her partshe should have been quite sorry if he hadmade them out better of sixorseven specialfavourites she left copies with lucy andafter her departure harry begged lucy togo over these again with him one by onek if he had ever known he had by this timeforgotten their meaning so that they wereto be guessed by him again with lucy'sassistance first said lucy comes a riddleyou eat me you drink me deny it alio can i'm sometimes a woman and sometimes a mani'm sometimes a woman and sometimesa man repeated harry and yet you areeaten only cannibals eat men and women and yet this cannot be a cannibal youmay as well tell me at once lucy for icannot find it outthen it is a toast said lucy youeat a toast and you drink a toast do notyou and sometimes a woman is a toastand sometimes a man deny it who canharry could not deny it but he observedit was a play upon the differentmeanings of the word yes and a happy play said lucyhappy for you who found it outsaid harry well i have now some notionhow to set to work i shall look inthe next for a play upon the words nowfor number two which he read accordinglywith his usual deliberationi'm latin i'm englishboth one and the other but the latin of one halfis english for t'otherbut neither latin nor english half couldhe make out and when lucy told him itwas a toad it was a considerable time beforehe could divide toad into to and ad orcomprehend that being latin for to andeach word being composed of two letters theterms of the problem were exactly fulfilledhe acknowledged that it was a shame forhim not to have found out this as his latinshould have helped him but he shelteredhimself under the change of pronunciationin both words lucy told him that suchlittle variations of sound must be allowedor there would be no getting on with riddlesvery well i will make allowanceanother time and that will help me i hopeto make out number threeinscrib'd on many a learned pagein mystic characters and sagelong time my first has stoodand though its golden age be pastin wooden walls it yet may lasttill clothed in flesh and blood my second is a glorious prizefor all who love their wondering eyeswith curious sights to pamperbut should they chance this prize to meetal improvise in the streetoh how twould make them scamper fmy third's a sort of wandering throneto woman limited alonethe salique law reversing but when th imaginary queenprepares to act this novel sceneher royal part rehearsingoverturning her presumptuous planup jumps the old usurper manthe lady had said that she believed thisriddle was composed by a great statesmancharles fox and lucy thought this verylikely from his statesmanlike allusion tothe salique law but be it written bywhom it might she thought it very ingeniouswhile she was saying all this harrywas pondering over the manuscript lucyadvised him to leave any first and go onta my second because he could easily guesswhat would make any body run away ifsuddenly met in the street and whatwould at the same time be a curious sighthe did make out that this misfht be awild beast a tiger or a lion lucy bidhim stick to lion and goon to consider whatcould be a wandering throne for woman yet a throne which must be enjoyed withthe assistance of man with infinitedifficulty harry at last guessed a sedanchair but sedan chair and lion would notmake any sort of sense therefore saidlucy remember up jumps the old usurperman that may help you but allher helps were vainoh tell me said he groaning a pillion said she he stared andlooked blank till she had repeated it syllabicallyhe went back to the pill the mysticcharacters inscribed on many a learnedpage being the physician s recipe andthe allusions to the old custom of gildingpills and to their present wooden receptaclesharry acknowledged to be somewhatingenious but he could not pass overthe fault in the spelling there was an too little if the lion's share was taken fromhim to complete the pill lucy assuredhim that he must make some allowance inthe spelling as well as in pronunciation a kind of poetical licence must be givenhe was willing to give any licencewhich the laws of riddlemakers allowedall he asked was to know the laws thathe might guide himself by thembut the laws will not guide you muchi am afraid said lucy let us go onwith the fourth and we shall seemy first doth affliction denotewhich my second was born to enduresmy third is a sure antidotethat affliction to soften and cureharry had no time nor opportunity topuzzle or blunder at this for his fatherhearing the words exclaimed that iswoman is it not lucy and addressinghimself to her mother observed that thischarade reminded him of fontenelle's justand elegant description of the female sex ce sexe sans lequel le commencementde la vie serait sans secours le milieusans plaisir et la fin sans consolationlucy now read number five my first conveys the irish lassto ballyshannon fair my second oft contains a massof gold and diamonds rare my third is worn by those i wotwho gold and diamonds wear the irish lass she wants it notat ballyshannon fairharry gave this up for said he iknow nothing about irish lasses or ballyshannonfair it is quite impossible for meto make this out so tell it me lucy carminei wot he does not know that use of itsaid his motheri do mother and you do not makethat use of it answered he with a knowingsmile and i am glad you do notdo you remember lucy that when i was ak very little boy and going my rounds wishinggood night i had to kiss a lady thatshall be nameless who wears quantities ofrouge i did not know that and unfortunatelykissed away half her cheek and left theoddest mark i could not help staying tolook at it and she was very angry butnow go on lucy and read your next whichis so short that i hope it will be easy the beginning of eternity the end of time andspacethe beginning of every end and the end of everyplacehe looked very serious it sounded sostand that he fancied it must be somethingsublime and much was he provokedwhen he was told at last that whathe had been aiming so high to reach wasonly the letter ebut you found it out lucy cried hehow could you i cannot tell said sheoh do recollect what put it into yourhead that it was a letter what was yourfirst thought how did you go on praythink lucythus urged to it lucy did her best torecollect and after a pause of deep considerationand snuffing the candles whichdid not want snuffing she said that atfirst she thought as harry did that it mustbe something very sublime but its beingthe end of every place convinced mesaid she that it could not be any thingserious then the contradictions theimpossibilities showed me it could not beany one real thing except a letterexcept a letter but how did youcome to that exceptionlucy said she had long ago heard avery pretty enigma upon the letter hbeginning twas whispered in heaven twas muttered inhell'sshe confessed she should never have foundit out if she had not heard thisthat is really a great comfort to mystupidity said harry for i never heardone of that sort beforenow my dear harry let me go on toanother which i must tell you beforehandis of quite a different kind it is acharade my first is a french negative my second anenglish characteristic my whole the essence ofall the charades that ever were or ever will bewritteni do believe it is nonsense exclaimedharrit is harry said lucy how didyou find it out by my english characteristic saidharry drawing himself up with a look ofmock pridesince you have found this out saidlticy perhaps you can find out the nextand it is the last now this is not acharade it is a conundrum burke'sfamous satirical conundrumwhat is majesty stripped of its externalsharry went to work carefully and rationallyconsidering what are the externalsof a kingbut lucy laughing told him that all hisfine reasonings would only carry him awayfrom the answer lead me to it then said he theway you found it out i did not find it out said lucy buti will tell you how i happened to know itonce in my old copybook in large handthere was the word majesty it was dividedthis way majests with hyphens betweeneach syllable look harry wdiat do yousee in the middle i oh i see it now said harry jest yes said lucy and when i showedmy copy to mamma she or somebody inthe room repeated this conundrum it is very good said harry m andyare the externals and it is a jest this isvery witty i acknowledge but i nevershould have discovered it it is quitedifferent from any of the others theworst of it is that after labouring ever sohard at one riddle it does not in the leastlead to another the next is always onsome different principle yes to be sure said lucy nobodywho knows how to puzzle would givetwo riddles of the same kind that wouldbe rather too plain but then without something to guideme said harry there is no getting on not in your regular way said lucyyou cannot go on from one riddle toanother as you do in euclid from oneproposition to another and say by the firstproposition and by the second and so onthat is the very thing i complain ofsaid harrycomplain but my dear harry riddlesare meant only to divert onebut they do not divert me when theyonly puzzle me said harry but the object of all riddlemakerssaid lucy is to make riddles as puzzlingas they possibly canwell then said harry since youseem to be in the riddlemaker's secretslucy pray explain to me the ways theytake to puzzle

isee i feel that will dos a thought flashes across my mind just as quickly as theflame of that candle jumped to mamma'staper and lighted it as if by magic didyou see the flame jump i did said harry and i wish theriddlemaker's ways were as plain as thatthe taper had been just blown out andthere was a little smoke which still containedsome of the inflammable gas fromthe melted wax this you see made akind of road for the flame to run alongin an instant the flame seemed to dartupon the taperit is just in that manner said lucythat our thoughts dart from one idea toanother and sometimes without any connectionbetween themno no said harry we may notperceive any but i dare say there alwaysis some sort of connection between ourthoughts like the train of smoke betweenthe candles but mamma said

digby castleat the end of which was written in sirrupert's own hand admirable morality in most elegantand classical language i wish mrs barbaldhad written more papa said lucy i wish you wouldbe so good as to give harry and me one ofyour old sort of puzzlesmy old sort of puzzles my dear what do you meansuch questions i mean as you used against inconsistency in our expectationsin miscellaneous pieces by j akin m d andanna laetitia barbauldto ask us sometimes when we were sittingroundthe fire last winter you may rememberpapa one in particular which ifound out it was sancho panza's judgmentwhen he was governor of the islandabout the old man and the ten goldencrowns which were hid in the hollow staffcan you give us some other questions likethat papapray do father said harry or ifyou have none of those ready some questionlike hero's crown or the kite andpompey's pillaronly whatever it is pray papa addedlucy let there be along with the questionsome little storybut my dear children said theirfather i am not a baof of stories andquestions as you seem to think me intowhich you can put your hand and pullone out whenever you please you mustgive me a few minutes for recollection bythe time you have finished that game ofchess perhaps i shall have thought of onein a few minutes lucy warned her fatherthat she should very soon be beatenthere checkmate it is all overwith me but you made no battle said harry you were not worth beating you werein such a hurry to get to the storymay be so said lucy now papais going to begin and we may roll yoursofa up close to the teatable this beingdone their father began as follows three arab brethren of a noble familywere travelling together for improvementit happened one day that their road layacross a great plain of sand where therewas little else to be seen except a few tuftsof grass towards the close of the daythey met a cameldriver who asked themif they had seen and could give him anytidings of a camel that he had lost was not your camel blind of an eyesaid the elder brother yes said thecameldriver it had a tooth out beforesaid the second brother and it waslame said the third very true repliedthe man pray tell me which way itwent did it not carry asked thearabians a vessel of oil and a vessel ofhoney it did indeed answered thecameldriver pray tell me where youmet it met it we never saw yourcamel they replied the enraged cameldriver could notbelieve this he charged them with havingstolen his camel and brought them beforethe prince from their manners and thewisdom of their answers to the questionswhich the prince asked them upon othersubjects he was persuaded that they wereabove committing such a theft he setthem at liberty but requested that beforethey departed they would inform him howthey could possibly have hit upon so manycircumstances that were true without everhaving seen the camelthe brothers could not refuse to complywith so just a request and after thankinghim for his clemency and kindness theeldest spoke thus we are not magicians nor have weeverseen the man's camel all we knowof him was discovered by the use of oursenses and our reason i judged that hewas blind of an eye because now harry and lucy explain if youcan the methods by which the threebrothers guessed that the camel was blindof an eye and lame of a leg that he hadlost a front tooth and was laden with avessel of oil and another of honeyharry asked whether there was anythingin the camel driver himself by whichthey judged no there was nothing inor about the cameldriver that gave anyassistance papa i wish you would help us avery little said lucydo you not recollect telling me thismorning that you knew my horse had beenat the door though you did not see itby the tracks oh yes papa criedlucy no other horse ever comes upthat gravelpath and as the arabianswere travelling on a sandy desert probablythey had seen no other tracks but of thatone camel but how did they know thathe was lame of one leg the camel would put the lame footdown more cautiously than the otherssaid harry and the trace of that footstepwould be always less deep than thoseof the other threethe bled eye was a more difficult questionlucy thought the camel might haveswerved more to one side than to theother or perhaps the footsteps might showplaces where he had started out of the pathand always on the same side a few otherguesses were made but nothing more wasfound out this eveningthe next morning lucy said she hadthought of the camel and the three brothersthe moment she wakened but the moreshe thought the more she was puzzledshe was just going to add papa i giveit up but harry advised her to havepatience a little longer it happened atthis instant that her mother was helpingher to some honey a drop ell on thetablecloth and a bee which was flyingabout the room settled upon the sweetspotlucy started with delight on observingthis and exclaimed harry harry ihave found it out the vessel of honeyleaked the drops fell on the sand andvol iv lthe brother observed the little collectionsof bees or insects which had settled onthem i am right for papa smiles asto the oil some of that might have beenspilled by the jolting of the lame camelthe loss of the tooth is all that now remainsso i leave that to you harry youlook as if you had a bright thought i remember said harry my fatherin the beginning of the story told us thatthere were a few tufts of grass on the road the hungry camel for no doubt he washungry in the desert might have bittenthese and one of the sharpeyed brothersmight have seen that in each bite a fewblades of grass stood up higher than therest because of the gap left by the wantof the toothnow we have it all right said lucyand we were very little helped considering but i wish we had not been helpedat all said harry i wonder whetherany body of our age ever found out thesequestions without any help his father said that the questions hadperhaps never been asked before certainlynot in the same manner in which he had putthem because he had altered them for thepresent purpose in the story from whichthey were taken some of the questionswould have been too difficult for harryand lucy but they were now ambitiousto try these and their father was willingto comply with their wish warning themhowever of the improbability of successin the original story said he insteadof a camel it was a horse and oneof the brothers discovered that the horsehad silver shoes and a golden bit and healso told the exact value or fineness of thesilver of the shoes and of the gold of thebit how did he know all thisi cannot conceive said lucy yetperhaps if you give us time papa someaccident might put us in the right roadsome lucky list like the falling of thehoney on the tablecloth and the beesettling on it might lead us to invent thething whatever it isno lucy said her fitlier no luckyhit could possibly help you to this youlwant some particular facts without whichyou cannot answer the question then cannot you be so good as to tellusthose particular facts said harry no my dear answered his fatherthey depend on the art of assayingmetals that is of ascertaining their finenessand value so i may as well tell youat once that the wise brothers had observedthe marks which the horse's shoeshad left on some stones in the path theyhad also observed the marks which thegolden bit had left on the stone trough ata well where the horse had rubbed it indrinking the skilful eye of one of thebrothers had been able to judge of thefineness and value of the golden bit andsilver shoes by the different colours of thesemarksharry pondered for a few moments andthen observed that the difficulty of explainingthese puzzling questions sometimesarises from our not having the particularsort of knowledge that is necessaryand sometimes from our not being able torecollect that which we really have forinstance said he we knew all that wasnecessary for answering the first four questions all the difficulty was just to recollectand apply our knowledge to thepurpose you can hardly call it knowledgesaid lucy if you mean such little observationsas those about the tracks of a horseor the bees settling on the honey everybodyknows that bees eat honeyand yet it was for want of oiu recollectingthose little things which every bodyknows that we were puzzled so long saidharrywell then harry said lucy if afairy were to give you your choice thisminute all the knowledge from all thebooks in the world without ofivinof you thepower of recollecting it or the power ofrecollecting well whatever knowledge youcould acquire for yourself which wouldyou choose to be sure i would choose the powerof recollecting well whatever i could getfor myself said harry for of what usewould it be to me to have all the knowledgein all the books that ever were writtenif your fairy forbids my ever recollectingany of it when i want itbut i did not say that there should beany forbidding in the case you may recollectthe knowledge she gives you just asyou please or canplease or can repeated harry thereis a great difference between them to besure i should please to recollect if icould but often i cannot and it wouldbe still more difficult if i were to have thatimmensity of knowledge which your fairyoffers me i should never be able to findany one thing i wanted in such a mass ishould be my whole life getting it into anytolerable orderah then you would feel the use ofwhat you would not allow when i wassorting my shells classification harryno single head could contain all theknowledge of all men's heads put togethersaid harry whether classified or notbut suppose my fairy has the powerto make yours contain it all said lucy would you have it yes or no she iswaiting for an answerno is my answer said harry nothank you mrs fairy i would rather nothave that load of learning but for thepower of recollecting quickly i should bevery much obliged to you indeed i feelevery day how much i want it and i cannotget it for myself but knowledge i canwork for and get for myself nature orone of your good fairies must give memoryi wish one would appear this minute andoffer it to meand i said lucy would be equallyobliged to her for knowledge but mammais it not curious that harry would refusethe offer of the knowledge and should be for accepting it what wouldyou do mamma and what would youpapa rher mother agreed with lucy that shewould accept the knowledge and run herchance for recollecting what she mightwant her father joined with harry indreading the overwhelming quantity oflearning and in preferring the gift of recollectionit should be observed that hisfather like harry had not a remarkablygood memory but that both lucy and hermother had quick recollective powers each chose according to their sense oftheir own deficiencies and each arguedaccording to their own view of the matterlong but not loud the question wasdebated on each side even till the last cupof tea lingered and grew coldfor some time harry and his father maintainedtheir argument on the ground thatit was best to accept from the fairy thatwhich cannot be obtained by one's ownexertions but this stronghold was shakenby the attacks of the opposite party andlucy or rather her mother doubted thetruth of the principle that the powers ofmemory cannot be improved at lengththey all rose from the breakfast table prettymuch but not quite of the same opinionswith which they began it was howeversettled that no hasty answer should begiven to the fairy till the matter had beenreconsidered and that in the mean timethe business of the day must proceedafter harry's business of the daw wasdone his pleasure was to make a modelof a machine which he had been inventingwith some cards that lucy had broughthim she sat at work beside him buther work was often put down while theytalked there was something mentioned yesterdayevening said lucy about a kiteand pompey's pillar i do not know whatyou meant about the kite but i do knowa story about an obelisk i will tell you all i know said harryabout the pillar and the kite and thenyou can tell me your story some english sailors laid a wagerthat they would drink a bowl of punch onthe summit of pompey's pillar now thatpillar is almost a hundred feet high andit is quite sniootli so that there was nowayof climbing to the top even for sailorswho are such experienced climbers thequestion my father asked me was how didthey get up i cannot conceive how a kite couldhelp them said lucyyou shall see said harry theyflew their kite exactly over the pillar sothat when it came down on the oppositeside the string lay across the top of thecapital by means of the string theypulled a small rope over and by this alarger one that was able to bear the weightof a man a pulley was then fastened tothe end of the large rope and drawn closeup to the upper edge of the capital andthen you know lucy they could easilyhoist each other up they did more forthey hoisted the english flag on the topof mr pompey's pillar and they dranktheir bowl of punch there and they wontheir wagerand they deserved it for their ingenuitysaid lucy but my story isquite different one evening after a wetday as we were standing at the windowi observed that the ropes were verytight between the posts in the fence they did not hani down nearly so lowas usual papa asked me if i couldtell the reason and i said that i supposedthe wet had swelled the ropes andshortened them it was about our hygrometertime harry so it was easy formeto think of this then papa recollectedthe obelisk story but first i shouldwarn you as he did me that probably it isnot true well well let me hear it said harrylaughing whether it be true or false then you must know that there is atrome a famous obelisk of egyptian graniteand of prodigious weight after it hadbeen brought from egypt to rome it layon the ground a length of time no onehaving ventured to erect it at last a greatarchitect and mechanic was employed forthis purpose by the pope great preparationswere made for fear of injuring theobelisk if it should fall but my fatherdid not describe the machineryi am sorry for it said harry i could not have remembered it for youif he had whatever the machinery mighthave been the obelisk was at last raisedso as to be very nearly but not quite uprightthe men pulled and pulled at theropes but oh terrible disappointment itwas found that they could not be tightenedany more by any means that had beenprovided or that the architect could suggestthere the obelisk huno the workmen ata stand the spectators all silent and thearchitect in despair i forgot to tell youharry that the pope had ordered underpain of death that nobody should speakduring the operation butt the instant whennone knew what to do an english sailorfrom the crowd called out with a loud voicewet the ropes water was thrown overthem they soon shortened just sufficientlyto raise the obelisk to its right place andit stood perfectly perpendicularharry thought it was a pretty storywhether true or not he could scarcelythink he said that the shrinking of theropes would have been sufficient nor couldhe imagine how the people could get uptowet them all it however reminded himof a circumstance which he had heard hisfather relate to sir rupert digbythe walls of some great building inparis were beginning to give way underthe weight of the roof they were pressedoutwards and were no longer exactly perpendicularto squeeze them in and makethem again upright was the thing to bedone for this purpose several strong ironbars were laid across the building fromwall to wall about half way up and theirends were left projecting on the outside fireswere then lighted underneath these ironbars till they were nearly red hot whichcaused them to expand and while in theirhighest state of expansion large thickplates of iron with holes in their centreswere slipped on the ends of the barsclose up against the outside of the wallsand secured there as firmly as possible bygreat iron nuts which screwed on afterthem the bars were then allowed tocool and in cooling they contracted andconsequently the iron plates and the wallswith them were drawn a little closer togetherthe operation was then repeatedwith another set of bars and so on alternatelywith the two sets till the wallswere gradually restored to their perpendicularitylucy thought this exceedingly ingeniousshe observed too that harry had recollectedit at the right moment though hecomplained so much of his memoryafter this a honos silence ensuedwhat can you have been thinking ofall this time said lucy only of thatmodel you are making i have been thinking of a great manyother things said harry among othersof some of the questions my father askedus last winter do you remember oneabout a persian painter i cannot recollectexactly how it wasyes i remember it said lucy itwas a very simple thing and yet i couldnot answer it an lilian prince a conquerorkouli khan or nadir shah ortamerlane or bajazet or some of thosepeople found among his prisoners aftersome great victory a persian painter nowthe conquering prince whoever he waswas not remarkably handsome he wasblind of an eye lame of a leg and one ofhis arms was shorter than the other butthis man pleased the prince so much bydrawing his portrait in an attitude whichconcealed all his personal defects that hegave him his liberty without ransom andof course half a dozen purses of goldbesides he painted him drawing a bowkneeling on the lame knee shutting theblind eye and pulling back the lame armthis attitude was the question well done of the painter saidharry but not well done of lucy forthis i think was an easy question particularlyfor you who draw and are used tothink of attitudes for figures how happenedit that you could not find it out atthe time you wanted because i was thinking of somethingelsewhat when papa asked you thequestion yes said lucy it put me in mindof something else at first setting out andoff went my head to that other thing andi could not get it back againand pray what did it go off tosaid harryoh to nonsense my dear said lucy first when my father spoke of an indianprince and a great conqueror i began tothink who it could be that was lame andblind and such a frightful figure theni thought of tamerlane and then of theiron cage in which he was shut up bybajazet and then off went my thoughtsstill further to a print of garrick in thecharacter of bajazet then came his greatturban before my eyes and the little cock'sfeather in front which i thought lookedlike the feather of spun glass that you gaveme ages ago this put me in mind ofmamma's saying it was dangerous to wearthat spun glass because the little bitsmight fall into our eyes my thoughtsthen jumped off to the glasshouse inshort when papa asked me for the answeri started my head was a hundred milesoff at leasti have often done the same thing andfelt the same way said harry aboutquestions my father has asked us anotherreason for my not finding out the rightanswer is that some fixed notion has takenpossession of my wise head beforehandand of which i cannot get rid did youever feel this lucy oh yes said lucy and i recollecthaving often been a provokingly long timein answering something that was quiteeasy merely because i had made sure thatit was difficult for instance that easiestof questions which you asked me once a herring and a half for three halfpencehow many for elevenpence i fanciedbecause it was so gravely asked theremust be something difficult in itharry smiled and you harry yourself continuedlucy may recollect you were full as longa time as i was about the herrings in findinghow to write fiftysix with four fivesyes said harry because i hadtaken it into my head that it must bewritten in roman figures and this prejudiceprevented me from thinking of theright way with common figures and fractionsin this manner but nowcontinued harry let me before i forgetit give you another a better or a worseinstance of the same sort of prejudice inareal good question of my father's sometimeago the day my father took me intothe dockyard he showed me a ship lyingin what is called a dock the keel wasto be repaired and for this purpose it wasnecessary to raise up the ship so that theworkmen might get underneath the questionmy latter asjkcu ms vraa ixow lievessel could be raised i was an hourpuzzling about it because i was prepossessedwith a particular notion about tacklesand ropes with which i had seen sailorsraising and lowering a boat and i thoughtthe ship could be raised only in that sortof way my father showed me the absurdityof that idea and then i thought oflevers but i could get no further i wenton thinking of levers and pulleys andwindlasses but never of the easy way thatwas before my eyes to let in the waterfrom outside of the dock the wateryou know would gradually float the vesseland raise it up to the proper height whereit could be propped up and the water letout again next tidehow simple said lucy just asour boat in the lock was raised i wonderyou did not think of that but harryyesterday i heard my father talking to youof some different way of raising a shipwhen it wanted to be repaired i cameinto the room in the middle of what youwere saying i wish you would explainit if you cani will try said harry you mustfirst of all knows that when a vessel isfloated into a dock to be repaired she isallowed to settle down with her keel uponthick wooden blocks aloof the middle ofthe dock and then i must tell you lucythat formerly when she was to be raisedup for the people to get under the keeltwo or three hundred shores or props oftimber were placed all under her bottomnearly upright wedges were then justpointed under the lower end of each ofthese shores and all the workmen fromevery part of the dockyard being summonedwith their mauls or huge hammersand stationed one or two to each shorethe wedges were all struck at the sameinstant by word of command a few blowsfrom all the mauls was sufficient just toraise the ship from off the blocks whichwere then taken away and the ship wasleft hanging in the air supported by theshores this was a very troublesome businessand wasted a great deal of time and labourbut by the new way all this difficulty isavoided the blocks on which the keelis to lie are not solid lumps of wood theyare composed of three pieces two of whichare wedges and when these are knockedout the centre piece of the block fallsthe ship is floated into the dock as usualand when the water subsides the keelrests on the newfashioned blocks the forestof shores are then firmly placed under allparts of the ships bottom in the sameway as i described to you before butwithout any wedges now lucy comesthe beautiful contrivance two or threemen only are sufficient to do the rest they give a few knocks on the sides of thewedges of which the blocks are composedout they fly the blocks sink and theship hangs on the shores i do hope youunderstand this lucyyes i am sure i do said lucy butit is such a pretty contrivance that shouldlike very much to see it done supposeyou make an experiment with your littleboat in our canalso i will with pleasure when i amwell said harry it is very agreeableto explain these things to you now lucyadded he because you do not think youknow it all before i can get my words orthoughts outit is a great while harry said lucysince you called me mrs quickquickit is a great while said harry lookinga little ashamed and i am glad ofit i think you are quite cured of thatlucy added heare you sure that i am quite cured yes perfectly cured he twice repeatedwith emphasis and even if youhad not cured yourself i should not be soimpatient now i hope as i was then ishould be very ungrateful if i were youwho are so kind and goodnatured to me thinking of nothing from morning till nightbut what you can do to make me happy then if you are happy so am i saidlucy but harry i must tell you thatyou are a little mistaken i am often intoo great a hurry still though you do notsee it because i have learned not to be insuch haste to speak but in thinking istill often make sad mistakes and reallyam prevented from finding things out bybeing too quickgive me an instance said harryi will said lucy about a thingthat happened very lately when we werewalking in the garden papa and i stoppedto look at the sundial which put him inmind of a story he told me that therewas a statue forget where on the statuewas this inscription whoever watchesmy head and opens it on a certain day ofthe year and at a certain hour of thatday will if the sun shines find a treasurethe day and hour were mentioned onthe appointed day and at the appointedhour some travellers who had read theinscription assembled round the statuethe sun did shine but what was to bedone some were for pulling the statuedown to get at its head for it was of oriaanticheight others proposed clambering uptobreak open the head they did scrambleup and they did open the head but therewas nothing in it the people were verymuch disappointed and they all went awayone after another grumbling at the statueand the inscription which had made suchfools of them one however wiserthan the rest stayed behind and understandingthe inscription rightly followedits directions and found the treasure and how did he find it was the questionpapa asked me and now i ask it youharryharry said he had met with the storysomewhere before the man observedwhere the shadow of the statue s head fellon the plain at the appointed hour andthere he opened the ground just underthe shadow of the head and found thepromised treasure was not that theanswerexactly said lucy but i couldnot find it out and all because i was tooquick how did your quickness hinder you said harry i recollected another statue of whichyou had told me harry and as soon as iheard the words statue and a certain hourand the sun shining i galloped off toyour statue of memnon which at a certainhour in the day when the sun shoneon it used to send forth certain musicalsounds for the music was made as youtold me by the air when heated rushingout of holes in some pipes which were inmemnon s lyre of all this i was thinkingand contriving how i could make sense ofit for i imagined that the statue's headmust be managed in the same way thenanother strange thought came into myhead that the music which i had settledthis statue should play should be like ourplay of magical music and that it shouldsound loudly or softly as the travellerswent nearer or further from the right placeand so guide them to itvery ingenious at least said harrybut it was all wrong said lucybut i see mamma before the door withher bonnet on cried lucy starting upand looking out of the window i daresayshe is going to walk to digby castleand i should like to go with her if youcan spare me harry oh yes and thank you for the timeyou have stayed said harry onlybefore you go give me a few large pins six stout pins thank you now awaywith you my dear i shall be quite happytill you come back againwhen lucy returned from her walk shebrought a basket filled with flowers fromthe hothouse at digby castle afterholding them for half a minute to harry tovol iv madmire and smell she began to put theminto a flowerpot telling him that she hadsomething solid for him at the bottom ofher basket under the flowers i know what it is said harry it isa booklucy looked immediately at the sides ofher basket to see if harry could havespied the book through the openings ofthe wickerwork but that was impossibleyou only guessed i suppose harrythat it was most likely that i should bringyou a bookharry said that he did not guess butthat he was quite sure of it on whichlucy went to his sofa and looked fromthence out of the windowbut you could not while sitting heresaid she see the mountain path downwhich we camei did see you said harry walkingdown that path with a book in your handand when you reached the great thornbushi saw mamma sit downthen harry you must have got offyour sofa to look out of the windowcried lucy oli fie harry you werenot to quit your sofa without leave fromthe surgeoni never stirred from the sofa saidharryoh i have it now cried lucy the mirror out of the camera obscura you are right said harry nowtell me what is the book you were lookinginto and where is it it is here in my basket said lucy but you shall not know its name yet imust first tell you that in our walk todigby castle i was giving mamma anaccount of what you and i had just beentalking about she said nothing or verylittle only smiled now and then whenwe reached the castle she went to thelibrary to look for some books and amongothers she took down this which she putinto my hand telling me that perhaps ishould find some things in it like what youand i had been saying to each other theauthor was a most celebrated philosopheri will not tell you his name harry butm only think of his having observed in hisown mind the very same sort of faultsthat we find in ours look at the headsof these pages wandering attentionsthat is my complaint then comes words abuse of that means somethinglike what you hate in riddles harryplay upon words or using words inaccuratelywhich he says is a very great faultin reasoningi like him for that said harry whoeverhe isthen said lucy here comes prejudiceand here is transferring ofthoughts by which he means not transferringthe not being able to turn themfrom one subject to another easily thatyou know harry is what you call yourofreat hindrance look here it ismy picture at full length said harrylet me look at itbut it is not like you nowe said lucyholding the book fastlet me see said harry or if youwill not let me see let me hearlucy read aloud men thus possessed in company that is withtheir own favourite thoughts said lucy are as ifthey lay under the power of enchantment they seenot what passes before their eyes hear not theaudible discourse of the companylike me i acknowledge on my disagreeableday in the carriage said harrywhen i did not hear what any of youwere saying oh listen to this continued lucy and when by any strong application these absentpeople are roused a little they are like menbrought to themselves from some remote region whereas in truth they come no farther than fromtheir secret cabinet within where they have beenwholly taken up with the puppet which was for thattime appointed for their entertainment the shamethat such dumps cause to wellbred people when itcarries them away from the company where theyshould bear a part in the conversation is a sufficientproof that it is a fault in the conduct of their understandinglucy repeated her opinion that this wasnot like harry now with a very strongconsolatory emphasis on that wordbut tell me said harry what wereyou and my mother doing when i saw youat the thornbush you and she openedand shut the book several times whatwere you about looking at different parts of this booklucy replied mamma informed methat it will tell us not our fortunes butour faults therefore whoever does not liketo know them must not open iti am not such a coward said harrynor such a fool i will open it directlythen i must hold it for you saidlucy as mamma did for meshe held it between her hands andbade him put his finger into the leavesand take his chanceharry opened and read at the head ofthe page presumption that is no fault of your's luckily foryou said lucy let me try will youshut and i will openshe opened at despondency no fault of mine said lucy thisis not a good hit either but i must tellyou harry how luckily the book openedonce for me when mamma held it itopened at similies pray read what issaid about those who are always findingsimilies begin here an aptness to jumble things together whereinany likeness can be found is a fault in the understandingnear akin to this is letting the mindupon the suggestion of any new notion run immediatelyafter similies to make it the clearer to itself then interrupted lucy she goes ontoprove that this is wrong and he saysthat these similelovers are apt to mistakewhat is prettily said for sound knowledgebecause they are content with their similieswhich are never exact that is what longago harry you used to complain of in mysimilies do you remember i should like to read that book saidharry no my dear harry i don't think youwould it is in such oldfashioned tediouslanguage it would tire you with its whereas aand wherefores and parentheses and roundaboutsentences one thing however willplease you said lucy a grandissimopanegyric that mamma showed me on mathematics and in the same page he sayssomething about the way in which youngscholars think and feel when first they beginmathematics you can say whether he isright or wrong thereshe read the passage f to him and hesaid that all about the young scholar wastrue as far as he could judge nowlucy tell me the name of the book andthe author locke on the conduct of the underi have mentioned mathematics as a way tosettle in the mind a habit of reasoning closely andin train not that i think it necessary that allmen should be mathematicians but that having gotthe way of reasoning which that study necessarilybrings the mind to they might be able to transfer itto other parts of knowledget he that has to do with young scholars especiallyin mathematics may perceive how their mindsopen by degrees and how it is exercise alone thatopens them sometimes they will stick a long timeat a part of a demonstration not for want of willand application but really for want of perceiving theconnection of two ideas that to men whose understandingis more exercised is as visible as any thingcan bestanding the great locke said lucynow harry is not it curious that weshould have thought and said to each othersome of the same things which this grandphilosopher says in this book but harryit does not seem to surprise you do notyou think it extraordinary n o said harry it would havebeen surprising indeed if we had thoughtthe same as the great locke about anythingelse but who could know so wellas ourselves what passes in our own minds and there must be some likeness betweenall people's minds pray does this booktell us how to cure these faults mamma says replied lucy thatwhen i am old enough to study it attentively shall find a great deal of excellentadvice in it but i have only read the onepage about my old disease of wanderingthoughtswill you leave it on the sofa saidharry if it tires me i need not read it but harry said lucy before igo i wish you would tell me why youwere so anxious about those riddles andm puzzles why you made me recollect foryou step by step how i found some outand how i failed in others because i thought it might teach meto invent said harrymy dear harry to invent riddles andpuzzles do you mean no i do not care about them saidharry but i thought that if i discoveredwhat it was that puzzled me in the riddlesi could by the rule of contraries preventmyself from being puzzled in other thingswell could you make out any generalrules said lucyyes i think i have made out one saidharry you know that we found outthe figures on a slate by sticking toaraby the blest therefore in all caseswe should guide ourselves by some onething which is certain and thus go on fromthe known to the unknownyes and kill off the wrong guessesthat do not agree with that one fact saidlucy like the play of the fourandtwentyquestions where you find out whata person is thinking of by asking is itanimal or vegetable or mineral and soon and each answer telling what it is notbrings you nearer to what it is till at lastyou come quite to the right thing so farso good for riddles and more good than iexpected and as for the story questionsit appears that the difficulty is less oftenin the question than in ourselves in ourown mindsoxe fine sunshiny day lucy coming inafter working in the garden opened thedoor of the drawingroom where harrywas now daily stationed on his rollingsofa and perceived that all the windowshutterswere shutmy dear harry what is the matter cried shenothing is the matter but take caretake care cried harry do not knockdownmy little table i cannot see your little table saidlucy let me open a bit of this shutter not for your life cried harry my father has just fixed it all for meonly walk straight to my sofa and shutthe door after you my father is going toshow me some of sir isaac newton's famousexperiments on light and colours and my dear lucy your setting me inpursuit of the green and blue shadows isthe cause of all this happiness to me myfather came in and found me at that bookhe talked to me about it and found outwhat i did understand and what i did notand then he said that all my pains shouldnot be wasted he will give us halfanhoura day as long as i am confined to thesofa to show us these experiments andperhaps he will tell us something aboutthe cause of those colours in soap bubblesabout which we have been so curiouslucy now found that she had been mistakenin supposing that harry could notpursue any entertaining experiments whileout of the reach of laboratory and workshop and her father assured her thatno account is given of these experiments becausethey can be found in scientific dialogues andvarious other publicationsmany most ingenious experiments havebeen tried by the greatest philosopherswith the simplest apparatus he recollectedhaving seen a letter from sir humphreydavy agreeing with priestley in opinionthat no man who waits to try experimentstill he has every convenience preparedwill ever make any discoveries inchemistry but i hope said lucy that ourfriend sir rupert digby's having such anice laboratory and workshop does notprevent him from being a philosophernot at all said her father thatdoes not follow what i tell you may beacomfort to those who have not these advantagesand may prevent them from conceivingthat they are essential to successa great deal may be done without thembut a man of fortune cannot employ hiswealth better than by preparing such conveniencesfor learning and science iwould say here the reverse of what a peatmoralist has said upon another occasion dr johnson observes that it is often miseryto want what it is not happiness to possessi should say of the workshop and the laboratoryit is often happiness to have whatit is not misery to wantin repeating these experiments of sirisaac newton's his father told harry thathe had a farther object than his mere acquisitionof the facts he wished his sonearly in life to observe with what care andexactness this great philosopher had conductedhis experiments how cautious hewas to make himself certain by repeatedtrials of the causes of the effects produced never venturing assertions nor trusting tohis own suppositions till they had beenverified by repeated trials never hazardinggeneral conclusions from a few facts andwhat is perhaps the most difficult of allnever taking any thing for grantedlucy having expressed some surpriseat her father's saying that this was themost difficult he smiled and said perhave the day will not pass without yourgiving me some little opportunity of provingit to you by your own practicea little while afterwards lucy who wasmaking some pasteboard model for harrywent into a closet opening into the to look for a saucerfull of pastewhich she had left there but the mice hadeaten it and she was forced to wait whilea fresh supply was preparing duringthis interval many were her invectivesagainst the whole race of mice and manyher resolves to put the saucer this nightwhere none could reach it she stoodwith an old newspaper ready spread onthe table for pasting suddenly a paragraphin it caught her eye and she exclaimed now mice i defy you and allyour nibbling mamma look here ihave found an infallible receipt for preservingpaste or any thing against thedepredations of mice the easiest wayin the world mamma only to surroundit with sprigs of mint pray mamma readthisi read it three months aoo mv deargait her mother and i tried it i surroundeda plate of paste with sprigs ofmint and next morning i found much ofthe paste gone and the mint scatteredi repeated the experiment with differentthings and always with equal want ofsuccessithere is an end then said lucy ofthe infallible preservativei do not know much about plantssaid harry but i believe there are differentsorts of mint they may not all havethe same properties perhaps the mintyou used mother might not be the kindrecommended in the receipthis father observed that harry's was agood suggestion that every circumstanceshould be the same in repeating an experimentotherwise it is not fairly tried andthe conclusion cannot be depended uponlucy expressed a wish to try the experimentfor herself if her mamma wouldnot be offended but harry assured herthat nobody ever thinks of being offendedabout trying experimentsthen i will run out to the gardenand gather plenty of mint said lucyaway she ran and at night she fencedher pasteplate round with a double row ofdifferent kinds of mint thus entrenchedshe placed it on the same shelf in thesame closet and shut the door in themorning her father and mother were at theopening of the closet to her agreeablesurprise she found that the paste had notbeen touched there were no marks in itof little feet or nibbling teeth and thesprigs of mint remained exactly in thesame order in which she had arrangedthemwell mamma what do you thinknow said lucy perhaps the receiptwriter may not be mistaken after all perhapsmamma you did not join your fenceof mint as well as i did perhaps you hadnot a double row or you left some littleloophole for the mouse to push his littlenose into what do you think mammaand papa and what do you thinkharry the door of the closet being open hecould see all that passedwhy do not you answer harry what are you looking ati am looking at something which youhad better see before you decide saidharrylucy followed the direction of lies eyesand saw just peeping out over the top ofa basket which stood in the corner of thecloset the head of a catoh pussy are you there all thistime cried lucyat this instant the cat jumped out ofthe basket and stretched herself as sheawakened upon inquiry it was foundthat a servant who had heard lucy complainof the loss of her paste and who hadnot known of the mint experiment hadput the cat into the closetthen i suppose said lucy that itwas the cat frightened away the mice igive up the mintno said harry do not leave it tosuppose do not give it up till you havefairly tried the experiment tonight makesure of the cat and leave the mint asbeforethis was done and the result was thatthe mint was found scattered and the pasteeatennow i am convinced said lucy but how very extraordinary it is papathat the mint should have succeeded forthe man in the newspaper and not for usperhaps he never tried the experimentsaid her fatheroh papa cried lucy do youthink any body would publish that mint isan infallible preservative against micewithout having tried it when i saw thosewords in print papa how could i helpbelieving them her father laughed and told her thatshe must not believe every thing she sawin print a friend of mine said heonce found a young man reading a romancecalled amadis de gaul which isfull of impossible adventures when heasked the young man whether he believedthat it was all true he answered to besure sir it is in print but father said harry i thinkunless lucy had been very disagreeablysuspicious she could not have acted differentlyhow could she possibly tell thatthe man in the newspaper was not to bebelieved or that his experiments were inaccurate she has been used to live withpeople who tell truth and who are accurate for that very reason my dear harry who have had experience of a contrarykind should put her on her guard againstthat which at her age she could not possiblyimagine without being as you justlysay disagreeably suspiciousharry felt that this was just but stillhe looked as if he had something elsesticking in his mind and which his understandingcould not swallow what is it harryit is this father said harry if wewere to try all experiments over againbefore we believed them we could neverget on something must be believed some things that are printed must be takenfor granted true harry said his father thequestion therefore is zt we should believeand whom we should trust you want rulesto guide you is this what you mean exactly said harryhere lucy was tired and went away tomake his pasteboard model leaving harryto down to the bottom of the well insearch of truthwell harry said his father take forinstance sir isaac newton's experiments before we tried them over again you believedin them did not you to be sure i did fatherand why harrybecause i knew said harry thathe had the character of beings accurateand that many other people had repeatedthemgood and sufficient reasons they areharry but when you do not know thecharacter of the person who makes anextraordinary assertion then how wouldyou judge after a few minutes reflection harrysaid by considering whether the fact beprobable or improbable right said his father when anythingappears contrary to our experiencethen it is necessary to examine the circumstancescarefully but at the same timecandidly some things in science thatappeared incredible at first sight havebeen found perfectly true remember theastonishment produced by the electricalshock the powers of steam and gas airballoons and steamboats supposeyou heard of these things for the first timeyou would probably have thought the accountsridiculous did you hear whatyour mother was reading last night fromthat new book of travels in mexico oh yes said harry you alludeto the mexican who was told by a manfrom europe that by means of a boilingteakettle a thousand persons couldbe safely moved a hundred miles a daythis was only exaggeration but therewas also an absurd story which the poormexicans were told that at birminghamthe clergymen are made of castiron andthat they preach by steam now if i hadbeen a mexican i never could have believedthat if fifty thousand people hadtold it to me because iron cannot feel orspeak or thinklucy returned to consult harry aboutthe pasteboard model she waited respectfullywhile her father finished whathe was saying she heard these words then you feel harry that no assertionscould make you believe impossibilities and that in all cases which are contraryto our experience it is necessary topause and doubt and examine i mayadd that you will sometimes find it necessaryto doubt even the evidence of yourown senses oh papa exclaimed lucy thestory you told us of the celebrated instructand his wig is a good exampleof that what can you mean my dear saidher mother your mother was not present when itold harry and you that anecdote saidher father explain what you mean then mamma i will tell you therewas a famous mathematical instrumentmaker not there ives but there is interruptedher father happily he is now livingand will i hope long live to be of serviceto science and an honour to his countryan englishman mamma continuedlucy and a very very famous instruct say houghton that's enough whisperedharrywell then houghton said lucy having finished some great instrumentof which a magnetic needle formed a partwent to examine it for the last time andfound to his great surprise that the needlepointed to different divisions at differenttimes having made this needle withgreat care he could not believe that it didnot do its duty he thought there must besome key or knife about him which attractedit but no there was nothing ofthe kind in his pockets he reasoned andreasoned but in vain he could not discoverthe cause he tried again and again thesame effect always took place and whatmade it still more wonderful was thatwhen other people looked the needle wasquite steady this perplexing instrumentwas the first tliino he thought of when hewakened next morning and he hurriedout of bed in his nightcap to look at ithe found it quite steady yet after breakfastwhen he looked again it was againall wrong but now mamma he had adistinct fact to guide him when wronghe had had his wig on when right hisnightcap he immediately examined thewig and found that it was fitted with smallsted springs to make it sit close to hishead the wig was thrown aside and theinstrument was perfectmamma said lucy i think it wasscarcely worth while to spend so muchtime and so much talking upon those littlecat and mint and paste experiments my dear said her mother if it beworth while to try an experiment at all itis worth while to try it accurately halftriedexperiments are waste of time indeedthey leave us no wiser than wewere before or what is worse they leadvol iv nus to reason upon wrong grounds and webecome only the more ignorant and themore positiveyou know mamma said lucy iwas willing to give up before i was quiteconvinced yes but there is a great differencebetween being willing to give up andbeing convinced do you not feel that itis more agreeable lucy more satisfactoryto be convincedi do mamma if one gives up thereis always a sort of feeling that one mighthave been right if we had gone quite tothe bottom as harry says and after allit is a very uncomfortable feeling not to becertain whether we are right or wrong and j should be sorry my dear lucycontinued her mother that you were todespise what you call little experimentsfew people have the means of tryingscientific ones but many little experimentswhich are both instructive and amusingare within everybody's reach your ingenuitymay be often more profitably employedin finding out the causes of commonappearances than in searching for those ofthe most extraordinary wonders in naturebut mother said harry do youreally think that one can gain much scientificknowledge by such accidental experimentsno harry said his mother certainlynot much scientific knowledge butit has been said by a very good and sensibleman who made the human mindhis particular study that some exercisesare worth pursuing not so much for theknowledge actually gained by them as forthe discipline they give the mind asthere are some crops which the farmersows not for the sake of the profit theyafford but for their beneficial effect on thesouthat is a beautiful allusion thoughtlucy and the beauty of the allusion addedmuch in her mind to the effect of thereasoning then mamma said she i wish youwould tell me some experiments to try ofthis common sortberkeleyn what are you going to do my dearwith that piece of new tape which youhave in your hand i am going to open it mamma andto cut off some strings for my frock well before you begin consider whichis the best way to open it that you maynot tangle the piece as you did the lastwhich you took out of my workboxthe best way to open it mamma arethere two ways yes said her mother some peoplebegin from the outside and some from theinsidei have always taken the first end ifound said lucy which was on theoutside but now i recollect mamma thatthe other day you pulled the end out fromthe inside so i suppose since you did itthat must be the best way try my dear there is a little experimentfor youoh mamma do you call that an experiment cried lucy yet to be sureit is added she and a useful one tooif it settles the best way of doing what wewant to do very often and though it is atrifle it is better to do it well than ill andbetter not to waste time by the necessity ofuntangling it afterwards and better notto waste temper too now i have woundthis piece upon a card without the leastdifficulty and i am convinced that from the inside is bestthere is another obvious advantage inthis method said her mother whenyou have not time to wind the whole pieceupon a card you may take out as much oras little you please and leave the rest unwoundbecause the outer coils protect andkeep in the resti shall follow the same plan with mynext ball of twine said harry for thatis very good reasoning and there may be reasoning i seeeven about such a thing as this saidlucyat that moment lucy saw in her mother'sworkbox an ambercoloured bonbonniereof pellucid horn starred with gold oh i mamma i like this better thanthe rubycoloured boxes harry do youknow how it is made mamma told methat the horn is softened in boiling waterand then pressed into the proper shape bya brass mould and those pretty little starsharry she says are first placed in themould and squeezed in by the same operationmamma may i help harry andmyself to some of these manycolouredsugarplums leave being granted lucy opened thebox but when the top was off she exclaimedat the sight of certain beautifulgreen sugarplums do not touch themharry stay one momentshe searched in her portfolio for a bitof an old newspaper and said nowharry we may try a little experimentlisten she read as follows test for detecting the poison of verdigris insugar plums sweetmeats pickles cit is said that some confectioners give theircomfits and sweetmeats a green colour by means ofthat dreadful poison verdigrise this as everybodyknows is produced by vinegar or any acid whichcorrodes brass or copper the pickles which areadmired for their beautiful green are often made incopper vessels and it is even said that cooks throwhalfpence into the saucepan to improve the green offrench beansa gentleman whose children had been made unwellby eating these green comfits wishes to makeknown the following simple mode of detecting thepresence of copper drop on the comfits a littleliquid ammonia hartshorn if copper be presentthey speedily acquire a blue colournow mamma i am not going to takeit for granted that this man in the newspaperis right this time i will try theexperiment before i say one word aboutbelieving or not believing him if youwill give me some hartshorn mamma harryand i will try it this minuteher mother directed her where she mightfind the bottle having brought it and selectedfrom the box several of the greenestof the green sugarplums which she put ona plate she applied to them a few dropsof hartshorn then adding more and moreto make herself and everybody else quitesure of the fact she cried they do notchange to blue mamma these comfitsthen are quite safe hold your handharry and pouring a good supply intoit she added you may now eat themwithout fear that i will said harry as he transferredthem to his mouth and withoutthe least fear because i never found thatthey did me any harm and i am convincedthey have no copper in them norpoison of any kind but lucy my dearif i had any doubt i must confess thatyour experiment would not have quitesatisfied me not satisfied you harry why not because said harry you have notproved to me the truth of your test youhave not proved that hartshorn will turnverdigrise or any thing which containscopper to a blue colour that was thevery thing you were to provevery true indeed said lucyshe now considered how she could trywhether her test was sufficient or not i must find a bit of copper a halfpennymamma will do on it i will poursome vinegar which will corrode the copper and after we have let it li sometimeif we see verdigrise on the halfpennyas i hope we shall we will drop somehartshorn over it and see whether it turnsblue then we shall be convinced whetherhartshorn is or is not a test for detectingcopperharry said this would be a very fairtrial but his mother observed that thepoison of copper was so dangerous thatshe did not like to have lucy undertakethis experiment by herself if they couldwait till she was at leisure she wouldassist themshe was at leisure or made leisure thatevening and without being reminded ofit recollected her promise she put twoor three halfpence into a saucer andcovered them with vinegar at the end ofa few days she took the halfpence outand left them some time exposed to theair when they were most satisfactorilycovered with verdiirrisequite green harry look at themsaid lucy but do not touch them said hermother a few grains of verdigrise ifn swallowed might kill you now lucyfor your hartshorn drop a little on theverdio'riseshe did so the green colour was instantlyturned to blue and harry wassatisfiedthis evening lucy was preparing aneffervescence draught for her mother of sodaand lemon juice the soda was in onecup and she was squeezing the lemonjuice into the other at one unlucky squeezethe lemon juice spirted on her mother'sofown her own frock and her brother'scoat coat frock and gown were stainedin different avays her mothers gown wasof purple silk that was spotted yellowbut her mother instantly applying soda fromthe cup in her hand the yellow spotsvanished and the purple reappeared lucytried the same remedy on the coat and onthe frock but it was not equally successfuland why her father now joined in the conversationvv'hich this question produced andlucy went to bed with her mind full ofexperiments that it suggestedin days of yore she had been a littledabbler in vegetable dyes and her motherhad let her dabble on with saffron poppiesbeetroot and weeds innumerable allher dabbling was not quite in vain shehad learned some curious facts though nogeneral principles now recalled to thesubject she was delighted with the discoveryof a book the next day in thelibrary at digby castle on the art ofdying wool silk and cotton fromthis she hoped to learn how to take spotsout of cotton silk or woollen cloth butthough the immediate object for which shebeoan to hunt through the book was lost inthe chace she learned a great deal that wasmore useful this book told of vegetableanimal and mineral dyes and of thosesubstances which chemistry has taught thedyer to use to brighten and to renderpermanent his formerly fugitive coloursthe beautiful system of mordants openedto lucy's view with her understandingmore enlarged than when she formerlytried the dyer's trade she couldnot be satisfied with mere receipts shemust know the reason for what she didthus by degrees with her mother's assistanceand mrs market's the multitudeof separate facts classed themselves in hermind and from these slight experimentsshe gradually rose to general principles ofchemistrywe have learned more by our littlerandom experiments said lucy one daythan you expected have not weyes said harry because thoughthey were little they were not randomexperimentsfresh subjects seemed every hour toarise and with entertaining variety butno more shall be told enough is as goodas a feast in our opinion much betterharry have you finished the model ofthe machine you were making with thepasteboard and the large pins saidlucy what a long time you have beenabout itbecause i made a great many takes said he and was forced to alterit several times but here it is at lastafter a critical examination lucy pronouncedit to be tolerably neat consideringthat it was a man's making shethought the teeth of the wheels might havebeen cut rather cleaner and with fewerjags left at the bottom of each howeverwhen the wheels were put in motion theteeth took into each other well enough tooshow the nature of the contrivance itwas as harry told lucy an odometer or amachine for measuring the lenoth of roadover which a carriage passes this it wasto perform by registering the number ofturns made by the wheel of the carriageif the circumference of a wheel is knownand the number of turns it makes arereckoned it becomes easy to calculate thedistance over which that wheel has rolledbut this machine fastened on the nave ofthe wheel would as harry hoped savethe trouble of calculation it being socontrived as to show with two hands on adialplate in miles and furlongs the spacetravelled over harry added that he hadbeen trying to invent some machine forthis purpose on the day he had been inthe dumps during their journey he couldnot then hit upon any contrivance whichwould answer though he had watchedthe wheel so long but after thinking ofit again and again at different times andin various ways he had at last made whathe hoped would succeedwhen his father saw and had examinedthe model harry pointed out exactly whatwas his own and what was borrowed inthe invention very little of it he saidwas quite his own each part he had takenfrom different machines which he had seenat different times the first thought wassuggested by a common waywiser withwhich long aso he had seen a man measuringthe road that machine youknow father measured by means of awheel and made me first think that oneof the wheels of a carriage mioht be madeto answer the same purpose the way ofconnecting the turns of the wheel with theother parts of my machine i took fromsomething i saw at the cotton mills andan arithmetical machine that i saw atdiby castle helped me to the manner ofcounting the turns and showing them inmiles and furlongs upon the dialplateso you see father hardly any of this wasmy own except the putting togetherhis father highly approved of his integritywhich he valued far above any ingenuity but i must observe to youharry said he that all invention is infact only putting together in a new manneror for a new purpose what we haveseen or known beforeas to this little contrivance his fathersaid that he would have it executed forhim in the proper size and that he wouldgive him an opportunity of putting it tothe test of experiment by which means hemight see how far it would succeed andwhat were its defects there is headded a watchmaker in the village whocan i think divide this dialplate and cutthe teeth in these wheels for us and asmith who can do the rest of e worklucy hoped that it would be ready bythe first day when harry was to go out inthe carriage and the surgeon said thatmight be the following saturdaysaturday came and the carriage at thedoor but the demeter so far from beingfinished was scarcely begun howeverthis was no disappointment to harry whateverit might be to lucy on this firstday of going out after his long confinementso many pleasures of such differentsorts absorbed his mind that as he acknowledgedafter wards the demeter wouldhave been too much the freshness of theair the sight of the country as they drovealong and all the old objects now newto him he enjoyed with the keen relish ofrestored health and liberty other andmore exquisitely pleasurable feelings filledhis heart gratitude to providence andgrateful affection to that dear father andmother and sister whose sympathy andtenderness and cheerfulness had in somany ways made him happy he scarcelyspoke during the whole drive and recollectingthis just as they came home whilehe pressed his mother's hand he said he wasafraid he had been very disagreeable ibelieve mother i have hardly said a wordeither to you or lucybut his mother well knew the coursehis feelings had taken and even lucy hadrespected them in silenceit was if lucy counted rightly ninedays beyond the promised saturday beforeharry's demeter was completed evenwhen the best workmen are employeddifficulties in making a new contrivancewill occur but in this remote place variousmistakes trying to the patience of youngand old were committed at last howeverit was completed and was fastenedon the carriage and the carriage wasdriven on a road to a certain distance theexact measure of which had been previouslyascertained upon examinationit was found to answer as well as could beexpected on a first trial there were somecauses of inaccuracy which harry perceivedand thought he could remedy itwas taken off and brought into the house and while harry and his father were consideringhow it might be improved lucywas talking in a low voice to her motherwhatever it was she was saying harry'sattention was so much distracted by it thathe could not comprehend some very simplesuggestionis it possible that you do not understandme harry said his fatherno sir not yet said harry blushingpiteously then suddenly he lookedback at lucy and she stopped shorther last word was patois nonsense nonsense muttered harryher father smiled now i perceivesaid he what confused harry's understandingso muchfather i assure you cried harry i never thought of such a thing for myselfbut why should not lie papa saidlucy do not you remember the historyof the young gentleman of eighteen whohad a patent for a new invention but i am not a young gentlemanof eighteen said harry i am only aboynotwithstanding harry's deepeningcolour and tone of discomfiture lucy nowwent on because she fancied that herfather would agree with her and that itwas only harry's bashfulness which madehim oppose her so bluntly but her fathergravely and decidedly told her thathe thought harry was quite right andthat he was lad that he had good senseenough not to have formed any suchscheme for himself lucy said no moreharry said his father a friend ofmine twelve years ago invented a measuringmachine on a new principle superiorto yours and to any i have seenhe has tried it for four years applied tothe wheel of his gig and he has sentan account of it to dr brewsters newseries of the edinburgh philosophicaljournalsharry was very curious lo see it andespecially desirous to know the new andbetter principle his father promised toshow him the description of the contrivanceas soon as he could get thejournalthen yours is now of no use harry no said lucy with a sigh i suppose youwill not do any thing more to itbut harry said that he should beashamed to leave it till he had made itsucceed at least till he had tried to mendits faultsthis resolution and his immediatelypreparing to carry it into execution obtainedfor him from his father a look ofaffectionate approbation happy in this hewent off with his demeter to the watchmaker'sas soon as he had left the roomlucy returned to the subject of the patentpapa i suppose that the reason whyyou said it would be foolish to think of apatent for harry was because you knewof this better machineher father said that this was not hisreasonthen papa perhaps there is somethingabout the expense of a patent whichi do not understand but putting thatout of the question would not you beglad that he bad the honour and glory ofitno i should not answered her father even supposing any honour andglory were to be obtained by itnor i lucy said her motherthough you look so credulouslucy paused again upon thisthen i see how it is said she yeti should never have thought it youwould be afraid that it might make himvain but i really do not think he is theleast inclined to be so well if he is not said her father why should we try to make him vain why put him in dangeri do not think papa said lucy thatthere would be any canoer of that sortfor harry my dear no human creature is altogetherexempt from vanity the most sensiblepeople are most aware of the danger inthemselves and carefully guard against itbut independently of the risk of makingyour brother conceited there are otherreasons which would prevent me as hisfriend from desiring that he should beearly brought forward into public noticeif my son were really a genius if forinstance like bernini a famous italiansculptor he had at twelve years old produceda work to wonder at i should nothave done what his father did and shouldnot have set it up in the vatican to receivethe public admiration the observationof the french wit is generally found to betrue c'est un fardeau tree pesant qu'unnom trop tot fameux can you translatethat and apply it lucya name too early famous is a heavyburthen answered lucy you meanpapa that people might afterwards expecttoo much from such early fame but thenif harry could do more and more and gobeyond wiat is expected how gloriousthat would be it would and in some few instancesthat has been found to be the case forexample bernini exerted himself to supporthis early fame and succeeded but ingeneral boywonders sink into insignificantmen without being a wonder howeversaid lucy it is surely a good thing thata boy should be thought clever and ihave heard people say that harry is cleverfor his age so have you mamma and youlike to hear him praised do not youmammai acknowledge it said her motherbut this is no proof that it is good forhimi know that you and papa must beright said lucy but still i should liketo understand exactly all the harm it woulddo himit would probably give him the habitof expecting praise for the slightest exertionsaid her father and then he wouldfeel unhappy and unable to exert himselfwithout it this is one of the first inconveniencesusually felt by those who havebeen early overpraised he would afterwardsfind other bad consequences of moreimportance he would no longer be satisfiedwith the feeling of doings what is usefuland good he would act not from theright motive the desire to do his dutybut merely from the wish to obtain praisethen he would necessarily become dependentupon the opinions and caprice ofothers and might perhaps be led to dowhat is foolish or wrong to obtain applauseeven if his oood principles preservedhim from doing wrong and hisgood sense from doing what was foolishstill he would lose that strength and vigourof mind winch should enable him to labourhard and long as all must do who wishto attain eminence in any science or excellenceof any kind moral or intellectualsir rupert digby as it may be rememberedtold harry that a kite hadbeen lately employed for the useful purposeof assisting in cases of shipwrecksince they had lived on this coastharry had heard of instances of shipsdriven on the rocks in such situations thatin a storm boats could not get out to theirassistance and sometimes the vessels andall on board had perished actually withinsight and almost within hail of the peopleon the shore who had no power to helpthem in circumstances such as these akite that could carry out a line of considerablelength and then drop in theright place might effect a communicationwith the shore and might be the meansof saving the lives of the crewthe idea of this kite had often duringharris illness flitted before his mindhe honored to know how it was contrivedhe had brought home the volume containingan account of that ingenious invention but his father had advised himto try if he could think of any way ofeffecting the purpose himself before heread the description his father now toldhim that captain danse's kite was notmade of paper but of light canvasstretched upon two cross sticks and thatas those materials were to be found inevery vessel it might in case of necessitybe made in a few minutes such akite it was said had carried out in astrong breeze a rope of half an inch incircumference and twothirds of a milein lengthbut continued his father youvol iv oknow that the chief peculiarity of thesekites is the ingenious apparatus for makingthem suddenly descend and it is fair totell you that this is effected by a messengerwhich travels up the string and detachesit from the bellyband or bridle thoughthe string itself remains fast to the headof the kite now harry an easy butcertain method of doing this is what youhave to contrive however inferior yourmethod may be still it will have been agood exercise for your invention and onan interesting and useful subject withinyour reachto assist him a little further his fatheradded that the messenger was composedof a hollow cylinder of wood throughwhich the string passed and of four crossarms on which a small sail was stretchedall this being explained the question recurredto harry at every spare moment and after devising sundry complicatedcontrivances which were one after anotherrejected he at last brought one of hisprojects to a simple form and immediatelyset about its executionof the strong wire which had beengiven to him for his suspensionbridge hehad some left he bent a bit of this wireinto a shape something like that of a pairof sugar tongs and about half an inchfrom each of the points of these tongs heagain bent the wire inwards to nearly aright angle these points however didnot meet but when the tongs were slightlycompressed they not only met but lappedover each other he then cut a narrow holeor slit in a thin bit of wood so that whenhis tongs were pushed into it they weresqueezed together and the points lappedover the elasticity of the wire preventedthe piece of wood from slipping thougha slight blow would push it off and allowthe points to open so far being completedharry carried his work to his fatherand explained to him his plansthe bridle of the kite said he is tobe hooked on the bent points of these tongs and you see father they must hold it fasttill the messenger knocks off this piece ofwood the tongs will then open and thebridle will slip off to the middle orohandle part of the tongs the main stringis to be tied but i shall also connect itby a short loose piece to the head of thekite which would otherwise blow awaywhen the bridle slips off the hooksthis all sounded well but would theforce of the messenger be sufficient todrive the bit of wood off the ends of thetongs this could be only proved byexperiment and harry was eager totry it his father had the wooden cylinder forthe messenger turned for him on a smallscale proportioned to his kite it wasabout six inches long and two inchesdiameter its wooden arms about eightinches in length the sail was made ofa square piece of light linen the cornersof which being stretched out and tied tothe arms the messenger with its sail wascomplete and ready for actionharry's kite was small but of the sameproportions as captain danse's it wasmade simply of two laths tied together in themiddle crossform the cross lath beingtwothirds of the long one in length andplaced within onethird of its length fromthe top a square silk handkerchiefformed the covering he stretched itover the laths tying one corner at top andone at bottom over their ends thenstretching the two upper sides to the endsof the cross lath and tying them in thesame way with twine he left the remainingpart of the sides and the corners tohang down as flaps or wingsthe tail was made with coarse broadtape and small bits of wood instead ofwisps of paper a coat button was tiedto the lower end of the kite a buttonholebeing made at one end of the tape so thatthe tail could be buttoned on or taken oftat pleasure this was a conveniencewhen it was to be carried out or put awayfor entering into these trivial detailsharry may be blamed by critics but perhapsmay be applauded by future kitemakersanxiously was the wind watched everymorning now that the kite was ready for trialat last a day came when there was happilywind sufficient and out sallied harryhis father and his kite it was some timebefore harry could get it up it flutteredwith uncertain motion rising a yard ortwo then sinking it trailed on the grassa fresh breeze raised it the whole lengthof its tail which floating obliquely seemedto struggle and writhe in the air by degreesit rose higher flapping its silkenwings harry held in the string till hefelt that the wind had power over the kitethen he judiciously let out the line moreand more or less and less as he felt theforce slacken or the gusts increase nowrunning with the kite now stopping feeling as it were with its feelings humouringits humours aiding its weaknessand glorying in its strength joyful atlast he saw it clear the trees rise rapidlyin the higher regions of air and thererest in steady poiseit is up cried harrybut can we bring it down said hisfatherup goes the messenger the wind carryingit swiftly along the line it appeared tofly gladly on its errandbut will it can it do its businessfor a few seconds this doubt keptharry and harry's father breathless thelittle kite reached and darted upon thelarger they struggled or seemed tostruggle for an instant like two birds inunequal contest the little one gainedthe victoryit's done it's done cried harrythe kite is falling and gently and safely both came downtogether harry ran to the spot wherethey fell to separate them and to see whetherthey had done any mischief to eachotherall safe not the least damagedone cried harrynothing could succeed better i giveyou joy harry said his fatherbut there could be no complete joywithout lucy harry said he would runhome to tell her and his mother all aboutit and to show them his good little messengerhe had kept the contrivance bywhich the kite was to be brought down aprofound secret even from lucy havingdetermined to try it the first time with noone by but his father and if it shouldanswer then he hoped to delight lucydoubly with the pleasure of the successand the surprisewhile harry had been flying his newkite lucy's mind had been occupied withfar other thoughts she could not guesswhat he and her father were about forharry had taken out his kite by a backway and then returning to the breakfastroomhad said in a half whisper canyou come out with me now father yes harry i am at your service so am i thought lucy yet he isgoing without methere had been for some days pastconferences and consultations betweenharry and his father as lucy had remarkedto which she was not summoned her curiosity and some other uneasy feelingswere excited which she could hardlysuppress and yet did not like to expressshe had been so much accustomed especiallyof late to know and to be interestedin all that occupied harry thatshe felt a sort of disappointment when shewas excluded from these secret councilsher curiosity was now raised to an almostinsupportable height by the signal thehalfwhisper the abrupt exit and secretexpedition of this morning they hadthrown open one of the breakfast roomwindows and jumped out her eyes followedthem as they walked briskly awayshe then took up a book to read but soonlaid it down and went to her drawingtable then she opened her workbox andat last sat down near her mother afteran unusual silence lucy suddenly askedher mother to guess what she had beenthinking of all this timeit will be easier for you to tell me mydear lucy said her mother smilingi will mamma said lucy andyet i do not know why but i am a little however i will then mamma youmust know that all this time have beenthinking or rather trying to hinder myselffrom thinking of something which i knowoisnot quite right but still the thoughtscome and i cannot help saying to myselfi wonder why harry did not wish me togo with him i know this is all foolishcuriosity mamma you are going to tellme soi was going to remind you my dearof the iron door said her mother ah yes to be sure but it was easy toput that out of my bead besides i didnot care much about the iron door but ido care about harry and is it not naturalto be anxious about what concerns himmammabut if he wishes you not to know it i know what you are going to sayinterrupted lucy that it is not right formeto try to discover it therefore i reallywant to put it out of my head pray tellme mamma how to do that turn your thoughts to some other subjectsaid her motherindeed mamma i have been trying todo so said lucy i took up a book buti read the same sentence over and overagain every instant i found myself lookingout of the window at papa and harrywalking down the avenue the sameideas would come back what are theytalking about what are they going todo i cannot think of anv things else if you cannot think do somethinglucy said her mother suppose youwere to cut open the leaves of that reviewfor me take this new motherofpearlfolding knife which your father gave methis morning is it not pretty very pretty said lucy looking carelesslyat itdo you see the colours which changecontinually as you move it said hermotherthey are beautiful said lucy buti have often observed such colours in motherof pearl but did you ever consider what producesthese colours said her motherthe reflection of light from the polishedsurface of the mother of pearl isuppose mamma said lucythen why do you not see the samecolours from the polished handle of thisivory knife said her mother placing thetwo before her in the same lightlucy now began to examine the motherof pearl more attentively she was struckwith the succession of beautiful tints thatwere developed by the least motion andasked her mother if any thing was knownabout the cause of these changing coloursyes my dear said her mother ithas been lately discovered that the cause ofthese colours depends upon a singular peculiarityin the structure of mother of pearlon its surface which to your eye andtouch appears so finely polished there areinnumerable scratches or indentures insome places as many as two or threethousand in the space of an inch andlying parallel to each other whether instraight lines in waves or in circlesthree or four thousand in an inchmamma but i cannot see one of all thesethousands i cannot feel even the slightestroughness but with a microscope said her mother and sometimes even with yourpocket magnifyingglass you would seethis exquisitely smooth surface full of thelittle lines or grooves that i have describedsome people compare them to the delicatetexture of the skin at the top of an infant'sfingerlucy continuing to rub her finger overthe polished surface said but mammawhat can these scratches have to do withthe colours i have a knife with scratchesall over its handle look at it mamma you see it has no colours but the handle of your knife lucyis not of mother of pearl no mamma but if scratches are thecause of the colours in the one case whynot in the otherthere is a great difference lucy theindentures in mother of pearl regularlyfollow each other in all their windings the accidental scratches on the ivory crosseach other at random the rays of light arereflected by the edges of the grooves andthe continual change of colour arises fromtheir continual bending and turningsthen mamma said lucy by polishingthe mother of pearl still more weshould get rid i suppose of all these littlegrooves and there would be no morecolourspolish as much and grind it down asmuch as you will said her mother aslong as any of the mother of pearl remainsyou will still find the grooves the samestructure is not only at the surface butthroughout the whole substance how extraordinary said lucy i have a still more extraordinary factto tell you my dear said her motheroh what mammathat the colours which you see on thesurface of the mother of pearl can becommunicated by pressure to sealingwaxand several other substances is it possible mamma cried lucy well since nothing should be taken forgranted will you be so very good as totell me how all that is provedher mother told her that it was drbrewster who first discovered the cause ofthe colours seen in mother of pearl andthat afterwards having stuck a piece of iton a cement made of rosin and beeswaxhe observed that the cement when separatedhad actually acquired the propertyof producing the same colours was not he excessively surprised said lucyhe was surprised and several gentlemenwho saw the experiment thoughtthat this unexpected phenomenon wascaused by a thin film of the mother ofpearl which might have scaled off andstuck to the cement a very simple experimenthowever convinced them that thisconjecture was a mistake he made afresh impression of the mother of pearl onblack sealingwax and then plunged itinto an acid which does not affect waxbut which is known to destroy the substanceof which mother of pearl is chieflycomposed f if there had been left on thewax the slightest film of mother of pearlit must have been dissolved but the acidhad no effect and the prismatic colours ofthe impression remained undisturbed thisyou see was a complete proof that therenitric acid f carbonate of limewas no film of mother of pearl left on theseal it does satisfactorily prove indeedmamma said lucy that it was thegrooves as dr brewster thought whichcaused the colours both in the mother ofpearl and in the impression on the waxyes said her mother and he triedsimilar experiments on other substancessuch as tinfoil and lead and all showedthe prismatic colours in the same mannerand from the same cause so that the factand its cause are now quite ascertained and you find lucy that you may believethem without taking any thing forgrantedlucy was quite satisfied and rejoiced atunderstanding how the proof was complete this is another instance mammaof the advantage of trying to find out thecauses of the common things we see everydayhow much dr brewster's accidentalobservation led to and to more than you yet know saidher mother i will read to you part ofa letter your father received this morningfrom him there is also a very extraordinary fact respectingthe communicable colours in mother of pearlwhich deserves to be mentioned one set of thesecolours is produced by the right side of the groovesand another set by the left side and both of themare distinctly seen when the mother of pearl ispolished but when the polish is removed by roughgrinding one of the sets invariably disappears therough grinding therefore destroys the effect of oneside of the grooves without affecting the otherlucy's mother then told her that inconsequenceof dr brewster's discovery ofthe cause of the colours in mother of pearlanother ingenious gentleman producedthe same appearance on glass and on differentmetals by simply cutting groovedlines on their surface the lines are sofine she added that without a microscopethey are scarcely discernible and the glassand the metal appear to retain their polishyet they and the colours also may be communicatedby an impression like those fromthe mother of pearl to the waxher mother then showed her a gilt buttonmr bartonthe lines on which had been struck by asteel die and a bit of glass on which theyhad been cut by a diamond and from bothshe saw the prismatic colours reflected asbeautifully as from mother of pearl but harry exclaimed lucy allthis time i have forgotten about harry how very nicely you turned my thoughtsfor me and quite put out of my headwhat i could not drive away mammathis is all your doing i wish it had beenmy ownthe best part of it is yours my dearchild said her mother the wish to doright the asking for advice and assistancewas your owni wish i could manage my thoughtsfor myself in the same way said lucythat curious discovery entertained meso much that i forgot every thing elsemamma this is another advantage of havinga taste for things of this sort theyhelp us to turn our mind from what youcall foolish curiosityj yes lucy they will often assist youin managing your own thoughts and yourown mind said her mother this isone of the great benefits which womenderive from cultivating their understandingsand the best use they can make of ataste for literature and science mamma resumed lucy after somepause i am very glad that you let mego on with harry i am sure it has beenthe cause of great pleasure to me evenon the journey it was so pleasant to beinterested in the same think's but aboveall during harry's illness it was thegreatest happiness to feel that he liked tohave me with him always reading andtalking to him and being interested in thesorts of things which he liked best mammai hope you do not think it has done meanyharm i hope you do not think thati have grown careless about other things not in the least my dear said hermother on the contrary i perceive thatyou have become more attentive to allwhich it is necessary for you to learn one other question mamma and ishall be quite happy if you can answer itas i wish i hope mamma that you donot think that i have grown conceited no lucy said her mother i thinkit will be with you as i have observed ithas been with others who are properly instructed that the more they know the lessdanger there is of their growing vain theyfind out how infinitely much more there isto be learned even from the most commonobjects by which they are surroundedyes mamma said lucy and ibegin to feel the truth of what you haveoften said to me that the more we learnof what are called the works of natureand of the wonderful inside of our ownminds the better we must become and themore pious i am not sure whether piousis the right word or religious but youknow what i mean i do my dear said her mother andas to the words it is of little consequencewhat words you use to express this sentimentif you feel it as i hope and believeyou do sincerely and firmlyhere he comes oh mamma hereis harry and his kite cried lucy runningto the window with a face radiant withjoy he came bearing his kite in triumphhigh she threw up the sash and he sprangin joy adding to his natural elasticitylucy my dear lucy it does itwill do cried he i would not tell youtill i was sure it would succeed oh mother it does better than even my fatherexpected but come out lucy come outand see it we will put it up again foryou for there is no joy without you andmy mother let me tell you about mymessengerthen eagerly he began to explain his kiteand his messenger but now when lucysaw harry's kindness it struck her howunjust she had been she was ashamed ofher past feelings and looked at her motherwith a consciousness and a change ofcountenance which harry perceived hebecame confused though in the middle ofa panegyric on his messenger and aftermaking some attempts to piece his storywith and so and so he stoppedand putting into her hand a knot in thestring which he had been endeavouringto disentangle untie this for me will you my dearsaid he his eye added what is thematter nothing nothing worth telling youi mean answered lucy it was onlythat i was very very unjust and that i amexceedingly ashamedthat you were a little foolish mydear i will not deny said her mother but you need not be so exceedinglyashamed because you did your best toconquer your foolish feelings this is allthat the best of us can dolucy told her brother all that had passedin her mind he regretted that she hadbeen vexed but was glad he said toknow how it was that he might avoiddoing the same thing again and she assuredhim that it was all her own follyand that she hoped never again to be soweak there is your knot untied for youbrother she added returning the disentangledstring and now all's rightagainthank you all is right repeatedharryand all will be rioht and will continueso between friends who in this mannerspeak openly to each other of those littlefeelings of which perhaps they are at themoment ashamedthis affair being cleared out of lucysshead there was some chance of her understandingsharry's contrivance and she andher mother went out and saw anotherexperiment of the kite which succeededeven better than the first the wind blewstronger and with bolder wing as if betterknowing his business the messengerdarted up to the very heart of the kiteand at one stroke accomplished its purposelucy rejoiced in the messenger'shappy performance of his mission andlooked forward with still greater pleasureto the idea of seeing the kite carry out aline from a boat to the shore she askedher father when the experiment might betried and harry observed that as damepeyton's sailorson had come home andwas permitted the use of sir rupert digby'sboat they could have his assistance allthe circumstances of a pretty little shipwreckwere quickly arranged and rehearsedin lucy's imagination with the differentparts assigned which each were to act insaving the stranded vessel harry's mindin the mean time went to work at calculatingthe proper size for a new kite whichwould carry out a serviceable rope buthis mother put an end to any further operationsby reminding harry that as he wasnow perfectly recovered they were to leaverupert cottage immediately and in thesecircumstances the making a kite of tenfeet long would not be very convenientlucy thought that as it was only foran experiment it might be as well triedwith the little kite all we want youknow harry is to be certain that you canlaunch the kite from the boat we on shorecan make a signal when it is right overour heads and then off you would sendyour good little messenger and everybodywould see how well it did its businessa circumstance which they had left outof their calculations but which was absolutelyessential to the experiment settledthe business during the few remainingdays of their stay the wind never blew theright way or strong enough to carry up akite the weathercock was every morningwatched in vain and frequently did harryand lucy walk along the beach in hopesof seeing a fine sea breeze curling thewater in one of these walks a boat thatwas rowing along the shore stopped abreastof harry and lucy and a gentleman init whom harry knew asked him if hethought his father would be so good as tolend him his small telescope harry ran toask for it and his father with the telescopein his hand walked with him to the seasideand permitted him to accompany thegentleman who promised to set him ashoreas he returned when he came backharry described to lucy all he had seen and what was on the present occasionmore interesting to her repeated all hehad heard of some people who were latelyvol iv psaved from shipwreck by the use of lifeboats a lifeboat lucy said harry is akind of boat which cannot sink thereare several kinds that which was describedto me was lined with large coppertubes empty and airtight so that in astorm if it should fill with water the airin the tubes would still buoy it up withsuch a boat people can go out to a shipin distress when none other could possiblyventure to seathe gentleman pleased with harry's zealandintelligence had talked to him muchon that subject and had related to himseveral anecdotes of a benevolent oldquaker who was in the habit of going tothe sea coast every year for the recoveryof his health that part of the shore wasvery dangerous and hearing of frequentshipwrecks he had a lifeboat built whichcost him three hundred pounds and madea present of it to the inhabitants thegenerous old quaker constantly rewardedthose who were most adventurous in goingout in it he was old infirm and veryill when the gentleman last saw him evidentlydying but his mind was as muchalive and his feelings were as warm as ifhe had been eighteen instead of eightyat that last interview the lifeboat wastalked of then his enthusiasm broke out he seemed to forget his years and infirmities and conquering bodily pain hestarted from his seat and took the gentlemanto his boathouse the boat wasmounted upon a carriage with wheels thatit might be ready for rolling down to theshore they could only get up the sideby a ladder but the old man climbed upwithout assistance jumped into the middleof the boat showed every part and appearedto feel a generous triumph m thelives it had already saved and those whichhe hoped it would yet save this wasthe last time he ever saw him and the lasttime this benevolent old man ever saw hisboat he died a few days afterwards all who knew him the whole countryflocked to his funeral and it was verysingular the gentleman added that whilep they were attending it the most violentstorm came on that had been known formany years a vessel was cast upon therocks and the people returned just in timeto launch the lifeboat and to rescue threepersons who would otherwise have perishedthe name of this humane and trulycharitable man was backhouse a namethat better deserves to be remembered thanthat of many celebrated heroes warriorsare often famed only for the number oflives they have destroyed but this excellentquaker ought to be remembered for thenumber of lives he has saveda day or two before they left rupertcottage to return home harry went thefirst long walk he had been allowed totake since his release from confinementit was to digby castle by the mountainpaththe day was bright and everythingwas fresh and pleasant the pathin many places was quite as narrow asthose could desire who love the narrowpath of danger there was full opportunityalso for scrambling up and downthe rocks so as to try to his heart's contentthe newly recovered use of his limbsbut at last the mountain path ended andthey came upon the roadhere harry and lucy walked slowlyand soberly and recalled to each othersmemories the first time of their comingthis road the happy days they had spentat digby castle and all sir rupert's andlady digby s kindness to them thenthey talked over what had passed at rupertcottage in the olden times of the canaland the lock and the roof and even on themisfortunes of his broken bridges harrycould now moralize with composure hehad besides the consolation of reflectingthat the failure in his bridges had led tohis learning mathematicswhen once their recollections beganthey went on or rather went backwardsthrough the whole time since they hadleft home they travelled their journeyover again and tried how much they couldremember of what they had seen or heardtheir recollections were very different butbetween them much was made out theone supplying what the other forgot lucyrecalled a variety of little entertainingcircumstances which had escaped harry'smemory and she benefited still more byhis clear remembrance of the solid anduseful she was anxious to show harrythat the pains he had taken in explainingsome things to her had not been thrownaway and her father who now joined intheir conversation observed that she didher brother credit then father said harry it is allowingto those first experiments you tookso much pains in showing us when wewere quite children for instance youmade me then clearly understand the principleof the barometer and that one thingclear and fixed in my mind was i havealways felt the greatest help to me therewas something i was sure of somethingi could always go back tolucy said she had felt the same andthat unless she had understood about thebarometer and the vacuum and the pressureof the air harry could never havegot her on through the pumps to thesteamengine she lamented however notremembering more of the variety of curiousthings which she had seen on her journeyoh mamma she continued i wishi had kept a journal then i should havehad them all safe your having them all safe on papersaid her mother would be useful becauseyou could refresh your memory from timeto time but it would be still better if youhad them all in your head so that youcould recollect them at any momentcertainly mamma but do you notthink that writing down things would fixthem better in my memory i am afraid not my dear said hermother i have often found that i completelyforget those things which i hadwritten downbut why is that mamma said lucyperhaps because we ease our conscienceof them said her mother andnever make any effort to recollect themthere is an english saying what iswritten remains it may remain on thepaper but not the better on the memorythe italian proverb is probably more correct l'ho dimenticato perche i'ho scripti have forgotten it because i have writtenitperhaps said her father anotherreason is that we are apt to write mechanicallythat is without thought andwhat we do without thought we seldomrememberbut papa said lucy if i had kepta journal i must have tried to recollectthe things at the time i was to write theirdescription in my journal though afterall i dare say that i should have trustedto harry's memory he used to ask meevery evening if i remembered such andsuch a machine that we had seen in theday and he reminded me so well of allthe parts that i scarcely endeavoured torecollect them for myselfyou see said her mother that youdepended on your brother and did notexert your own memory though yoursis perhaps naturally better his has servedhim more usefullyyes mamma said lucy but ireally believe that talking of what we haveseen or heard makes one remember betterthan even writing down the pleasureof talking is a great help added shelaughing i think there is also a pleasure inlistening said harry certainly said lucy when one islistening to what is interesting or new butotherwise i hear as it were without listeningand then the words go in at one earand out of the other i have only thesound left yes lucy said her father you hearmechanically without attending in the sameway as you would copy with a machineyour mind is then merely passive whereasthe pleasure of any successful exertion aswell as the labour of thinking have theeffect of fixing ideas or impressions in ourminds pain or pleasure of any kindjoined or associated with our thoughtssecure them in the memory and assist usin recollecting them if you reflect onp your own mind i think you will find thatto be the caseharry drew closer to his father thiswas a subject peculiarly interesting to himas he had lately been so intent upon findingout what he called the workings ofhis own mind his father stopped shortand good humoured remarked thatthough lucy knew much less than harrydid yet she had told them much more ofwhat she had seen and heardharry was silent and lucy feeling forhis condition filled up the interval withtalking to give him time and she finishedwith an allusion which relieved his embarrassmentand made even his gravitysmile papa harry and i are like twobottles one full and the other with verylittle in it shake the full bottle and youhear no sound but shake the half emptyone and you hear it rattle finelyby this time they were within sight ofthe castle and harry heartily glad to beexcused from further explanation cameforward to open the gates for his mothertheir good friends the housekeeper hadfrom her turret window descried their approacheven from the farthest end of theavenue and she had prepared for them aluncheon such as might have tempted themost determined antipuncheons to breakhis resolution these were the first strawberriesof the season from the forcinghousewhich the gardener was proud toset before his master's friends since ashesaid his master and mistress were notat home this was the best could becomeof them all were eager to offer harrythe best of what the castle could affordfor the history of his accident was wellknown the father of the child he hadsaved waited upon them and lingered andlooked often and long before he could feelconvinced that master harry was quitehimself again as stout in his limbs andas good as ever his last excuse forcoming into the room was to bring a messagefrom the steward about a box whichhad come from sir rupert with some lampswhich he could not rightly understandand begged to show them to harry's fatherthey were found to be miners safetylampswhich sir rupert before he leftengland had bespoken and had givenorders should be sent to an estate of his atsome distance where there were coal minesby some mistake this box had been sent todigby castle it was a mistake by whichharry profited once he had had a glimpseof one of these lamps in the mine whichhe had seen on the journey but his fatherhad not then explained it to him theready footman carried one into the librarywhere harry might examine it at hisleisure his mother found for him thedescription and explanation of the lamp inthe philosophical transactions which heimmediately read with the lamp beforehim he was struck with the simplicityof this admirable invention by which thelives of thousands have been saved fromthe destructive explosions of the liredampin mines but what particularly delightedharry was the account given by the inventorof the way in which he was ledstep by step to the discovery on whichthe excellence of this really wonderfullamp depends first he discovered thatflame will not pass through long tubes ofless than a certain diameter then that tubesof metal conduct away heat better thanthose of glass which determined him to usemetal then experiment proved to himthat it was the diameter and not the lengthof the tubes that was essential to his purposein consequence of which he shortenedand shortened them till to his great satisfactionhe found that tubes might be dispensedwith entirely and that a plate ofmetal perforated with small holes or evenwire gauze with interstices of the samediameter as the tubes would answer equallywellas harry's father observed to him therecannot be a finer example of the rise progressand perfecting of a useful philosophicalinvention in the first place no partof it was owing to accident to any luckybit or even to any casual observation butall was the consequence of a settled goodpurpose working in the mind of a man ofscience genius knowledge and humaneviews he had heard of the destructioncaused by firedamps and determined totry what could be done to avoid or preventthe danger his first step was to go downinto the mines and examine into the natureof these noxious vapours his previousknowledge of chemistry was here essentialto his success and each step was forwardedby his philosophic habits in trying experiments by his observing and reasoningon all appearances before him and employingalternately theory and experimentthat is to say first forming a conjecturehow the thing might be done and thenimpartially trying whether his suppositionswere right or wronghow much the public his fatheradded and how much young people ofrising genius are obliged to inventors whoboth can and will thus lay open theirminds many ingenious persons seem notto have had the power of describing theirown inventions for instance vaucansona celebrated french mechanic who nevercould describe his own machines otherslike hooke whose life harry you readlately have been so suspicious of theirrivals that during their whole lives theywould not open above half their mindsand at their death left their contrivanceslocked up in enigmatical language theyseem to have taken pains to obliterate alltraces of the road their minds took lestrivals should follow in their tracks butmy dear son observe that really great menare superior to such mean jealousy youfeel how much sir humphrey davy has inthis instance by his openness increasedour admiration and gratitudewhen they were setting out on their walkback to rupert cottage harry said tolucy let me go on before with my fatheri want to talk to him alonevery well said lucy this time jshall have no foolish curiosityyou need not said harry it is nosecret if you please i will tell you myreason for wishing that you should notbe by no pray do not harry i assure you am not curious now so go on with papamy mother is going to make a sketch ofdigby castle from this place i havepaper and pencil and i will also try whati can do will you wait for us at thesuspension bridgethank you my dear good lucy saidharry taking her pencil from her handand cutting it to a fine point but youmust let me tell you my reason it is onlythat what i want to say to papa is all aboutmyself and you know that when one hasto talk of oneself and one's own littlefeelings and schemes one can speak muchmore freely when nobody else is presentthe fact was that the sight of theminers lamp and the account of that discoveryand the admiration which hisfather had expressed at the idea that thousandsof lives would be saved by this oneinvention had altogether worked up harry'senthusiasm thoughts which had beenlying quietly at the bottom of his mindwere now set in motion and thrown to thesurface his father knew him better thananybody else his father was therefore theconfidant he preferred to all others happythe son who in like circumstances feelsthat his father is his best friend father said harry a few wordsyou said to me long ago made a greatimpression on me i have often thoughtof them since and of something of thesame sort which sir rupert said to me atthe time of the balloon when we weretalking of great inventions do you recollectfather vhis father recollected and spared himthe difficulty of repeating the words sirrupert had prophesied that if harry's applicationand diligence continued he wouldhereafter distinguish himself as a man ofsciencethen must tell you father continuedharry that i have long had deepdown in my mind deeper i believe thananybody sees but you a great ambition tomake some time or other in my life somegreat discovery or invention i have beenlong thinking of this and considering howother people have succeeded when iwas confined to the sofa i thought of itmore and more and particularly how icould manage my own mind so as to makeit do what i want in reading the accountsof the childhood of great or scientificmen i have tried to find out whatthey did and said that i might comparemy thoughts and ways of going on withtheirs but enough is never told of thesethings on the other hand father whenone thinks of the millions of people thatexist and of the few that distinguish themselvesit does appear very presumptuousto hope that i should succeed how manypeople when young must have had thesame feelings that i have now and thesame ambition yet they have failed butwhy have they failed this is what i wantto ask you father another thing puzzlesme continued harry who could nowspeak fluently his thoughts flowing onand forcing themselves into words duringour journey when we were at the glasshouseand when we read all about thediscovery of printing and since that timewhen sir rupert digby was giving us thehistory of electricity and of the inventionof balloons and more lately still in thosebooks which i have been reading duringmy illness i have continually observedwith surprise how long it was before eventhe most ingenious men hit upon thosediscoveries and inventions which nowthat we know them appear to us so easyand simple and i have said to myself ifthese things were so difficult to them howlittle chance have i yet father i thinkpeople have a better chance now than informertimes more discoveries have beenmade in our days than in the time of theancients yes said his father because knowledgeis more generally diffused morepeople try experiments and all are convincedthat this is the best method ofarriving at truth or of making discoveriesstill father i want to find out whynow that this is known so few among thenumbers who try succeed i wish i couldfind this out that i might learn how tosecure the best means for myselfsome people said his father areinaccurate in their mode of trying experimentsor rash in drawing their conclusions or they may have some prejudiceor favourite theory which blinds the truthfrom them and prevents their seeing whatis before their eyes their failure arisesfrom taking a wrong view of the object orawrong road to itharry asked his father if he knew ofany book that gives directions or advicehow to get forward in science or thatpoints out the best ways of trying experiments i looked over much of that bookof locke's said harry to try if i couldfind any thing of this sort but i could notis there any such helping bookhis father mentioned bacon on theadvancement of learning hooke onthe means of improving natural philosophy mayfair's history of the progressof physical science and some othersthen as soon as we get home and aresettled said harry i will begin andread some of these would you adviseit father i have such confidence in your goodsense and resolution harry said his father that i feel no apprehension of discouragingyour laudable ambition by answering no i would not advise you toread any of those books yet they wouldperhaps prevent you from working out yourown observations and from reflecting impartiallyas you have begun to do uponyour own mind i advise you then mydear son to persevere steadily and regularlyin your present course never let anyoneday pass without advancing some stepwithout acquiring some fresh knowledgecontinue with your sister your happypractice of mutual instruction exerciseyour faculties your memory your reasoningpower your invention no matter onwhat so that you exercise them theywill strengthen and we can afterwardsturn them and your habits of applicationto whatever may be necessary for your progressin science and virtue and for yourhappinessmy happiness cried harry thegreatest possible happiness i can conceivein this world next to doing my dutywould be to make some grand inventionsome noble discoveryto this he recurred this was the chorusof all his thoughts it was said with suchenthusiasm as strongly to excite the sympathyof his father who paused for somemoments before he again spokei must not be misled by my hopes orby yours harry said he lest i shouldprepare for you bitter disappointment infuture whether you may ever distinguishyourself or not will depend probably oncircumstances over which neither you nori may have any control but whetheryou do or do not succeed in the object ofyour ambition you may certainly my dearboy by cultivating your taste for sciencesecure a large portion of happiness youmay become such a man as your friend sirrupert digby you see how useful howrespectable how happy he is you seethat it is his taste for science his indefatigablepursuit of knowledge and his constantexertions to be of use to others whichconstitute his happiness a species of happinessthat is independent

forlucy sorry that she had not heard theselines she and his mother joined themsoon afterwards just in time to hear thewords with which his father concluded theconversationi consider you my dear son as
