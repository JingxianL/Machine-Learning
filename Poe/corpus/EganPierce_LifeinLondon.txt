about the paintings that seemedalmost to fasten him to the spotin the sketchroom which was principally dedicated tothe productions of the late george norland jerry wasrather more if not quite at home almost skipping with raptureas his eye ran over the subjects of that unrivalled genius ofthe pencil nature was seen so strongly at every touch that the works of this distinguished painter and his gieat eccentricity ofcharacter were often the subjects of conversation between corinthiantom and his visitors jeeet laughed heartily on being told by his cozthat eaekt who lived like a hermit entirely by himself in a verycapacious house on the delphi terrace in order to save the expense ofrepairing a broken pane of glass placed a most beautiful painting of thevalue of five hundred guineas against the window to keep out the coldand the rain this great artist was the intimate friend of the late edmundburke esq and so delighted was barry with the work on the sublimeand beautiful when it was first shown to him in manuscript that heliterally copied every word of it for his own use life in londonjerry nearly fancied himself again at hawthorn halllooking at his dogs pigs and horsesit was the opinion of corinthian tom in his remarks tojerry when the latter first entered this apartment that ifnorland had only painted half the number of subjects whichare now before the public their value might have beenenhanced twice as much and finished pictures instead ofsketches most likely would have been the result this wasthe reason tom assigned to jerry for having it called thesketchroom nine times out of ten said tom dullmatteroffact calculation is not allied with genius moneyto george norland was a colour that he did not paint with and therefore respecting its value he seemed to know nothingembarrassment and the catchpoles first drew up the curtainand showed him the iron bars which stopped his thoughtlesscareer they also explained to him in the most feelingmanner the uses of a strong lock they likewise pointed outto george the difference of his prospects not in an artistlikemanner to his mind's eye but in a clear distinct way ofbusiness that twenty shillings make a pound for the orienthe keenly felt the disgusting cramped situation of carey streetwhich compelled him io peep at his objects through the ironrails of his apartment for the moment also he felt the immediatenecessity of procuring the gold talismanic key to givehim once more his liberty again to wander amidst the beautiesof nature it was then that norland painted for money itwas then that genius was in fetters it was then that rapidexertions got the better of his taste the instance speaks forciblyfor itself the sooner you joint me a picture mrnorland said the leary bumtrap the sooner the

andparchment had long been removed from the hands of dickeyand his principal occupation now consisted in talking over theversatility of fashion to his customers and giving directionsto his men but the slightest idea that might drop fromcoeinthian tom respecting the advantages of dress was whatdickey could not resist and he therefore ordered his carriageimmediately to attend upon our rustic herojerry in training for a swell lrtom and jekky previously to the arrival of the apparelfurnishedhad been discussing the advantages resulting fromdress and address and the corinthian had also been

poet's observationto its utmost extent said tom that the considerationof that noblest of animals is one of the most proper studieswhich belong to the education of an individual it is ourduty to trace him through the various avenues that lead to hiselevation and it is also incumbent upon us to penetrate into thedark paths which ultimately bring man into a degraded statethe comparisons of many men so often impressed on mymemory by my late worthy father now flash across myrecollection so strongly that i will repeat them for yourinstruction jerry and though rather odd were not altogetherperhaps unjust some of them he thought bore a likenessto a badlywritten dramatic piece decorated with the mostfascinating scenery and captivating music and many of theaudience upon retiring to their closets have felt a sort ofvexation in being lulled off their guards by such gaudy allurementsor that delusion could have been dressed up so speciouslyas to have overcome the advantages of common sense justso

place withoutshowing symptoms of the johnny eaw tom thereforeproposed as a diversity of scene that jerry should go withhim to the masquerade at the opera house the onlydifficulty which existed on the subject was what characterjerry could personify to the most advantage and with easeto himself logic with a grin on his face suggested thatjerry would be quite at home if he went as a huntsmanit was a sure place to turnup plenty of game and with hiswhip in his hand he would have an opportunity of lashing allthe folly that might surround him the view halloo ofwhich he was so complete a master now

your direction my dear coz repliedhawthorn i cannot fail give me but a few hints beforewe start and i will do my best to play my part to yoursatisfaction it shall be so and what character do youintend to personify logic said the corinthian theoxonian thought that he should merely parade the room in adomino for the first half hour and if he then felt himself inahumour to have a bit of fun he would

masquerade supper corinthian and jerry logic felt quite pleased at the funwhich he had pictured to himself he should experience incrossing his two friends while their minds were entirelyengaged in the surrounding scene and perhaps thrown offtheir guard and also in being frequently at their elbowswhen they thought that he was placidly pacing up and downthe rooms as a silent spectator in an insignificant dominojerry had received his cue from the corinthian and healso picked up a few loose hints from logic as they rode inthe carriage through the streets bob screwed up his comicalface assuming a sort of gravity and assured hawthorn thata masquerade represented one of those luxurious moments whenscarcely anything but the passions prevail it is also a finepicture of life in the metropolis it has its attractions andits drawbacks for my own part said logic i have beendelighted beyond measure at the extraordinary talents that ihave met with at this species of amusement as well as havingbeen disgusted with witnessing impudence substituted forability but nevertheless the contrast is not only entertainingbut profitable as it affords degrees of comparison towardsacquiring a more intimate acquaintance with the variousclasses of society a masquerade at all events gives an opportunityfor the exhibition of talents the searchers after funmay either find it or create it the man of wit may sjww itthe punster be quite at home the satirist have fullscope for his powers of ridicule the dancer may sport afoe with effect and applause and the lovers of music enjoy atreat the

half an hour in search of novelty andthe windup of the critic is that a masquerade in england is one of the dullest species of amusement and that thoughthe room is full of characters in point of fact it really possessesno character at all for merit and talent nay he termsit shocking and quite a borea view hallo for the critic interrupted jeery so sayi rejoined logic and you may travel from dan to beershebaand cry all is barren but i am not one of that des notwithstanding the great vivacity of the french people the masqueradesin england have been considered with all their defects by mosttravellers to be in point of spirit and characters much superior to suchamusements in france punch and punchinello being by far the mostnumerous personages at a french masqueradea masquerade

numerous acquaintances who havebeen playing off their wit and raillery against each other allthe evening under their various disguises a masqueradeis an unsorted class of society i readily admit but

crying philosopher afraid to stir from your own firesidein order to prevent contamination and be devoured byhypochondriacal the remainder of your days it principallydepends in my humble opinion on the strength of mind possessedby the persons themselves here logic was interruptedby their arrival at the opera house well done criesthe corinthian most impartially argued bob now forit jerry remember

neverthelessprominent and attractivesuch a lively scene could not but operate upon the mind ofjerry although he had been in a great degree prepared forit by tom and logic and he seemed so dazzled for the instantthat he was in the act of drawing backwards as if afraid toproceed when logic whispered into his ear to go it jerry soon started from his surprise and gave the mewjiajlooso loud and fine as

the animation of a real foxchasewith a fine country before him and the dogs and horsemen athis heelsfrom the flattering reception jerry met with in traversingthese regions of frolic and fun he soon overcame his fears and the corinthian felt quite pleased that his prougi hadacquitted himself with so much talent indeed from thevivacity he exhibited jerry appeared more like an oldstager in these revels than the inexperienced fearful descantin fact hawthorn was so much alive to the scene before himthat he hallooed sung and slashed along with his whip tillhe was almost exhausted and compelled to sit down tomas his sonship had been also actively engaged in distributinga thousand elegant compliments to the lovely fair ones andlogic under the domino had been going it upon a few ofhis friends with much humour the time of tom and jerryhad been so pleasingly occupied that neither of them hadbestowed one thought about logic the oxonian takingadvantage of this circumstance had slipped out to

with finer game here than everyou turned up in the neighbourhood of hawthorn hall who the deuce is that cries hawthorn that knows mehere but logic had dashed into the midst of the crowd ofmasks and

hedid not know his old pal bob logic confound youreplied the corinthian you had nearly brought meinto a troublesome scrape and made me feel for the momentrather uncomfortable but no matter now as you haveexplained it where's jerry our heroes immediatelywent in search of hawthorn whom they found animatedlypressing the hand of a nun and soliciting with greatardour a sight of her face her name c praising her shapeand make and saying how much he admired her logicand tom did not interrupt the utebate but kept aloof waitingto see the denouement the lady it seems having caughtsight of jerry's countenance unknown to him at an earlypart of the evening while he was taking some refreshmentrecognised him as the prougi of the corinthian and withmuch naivete asked jerry if he followed all his

is no no you shall have no clue at allfrom me what am i about a complete stranger and too dear sir how can you make such an improper request but jerry was too much of a sportsman to quit thefield at

talents displayed by his incognita while thelady with a graceful nod skipped off and in all probabilityhe might have remained in his reverie for some minutes if thelaughter and two hearty slaps on the shoulder from tom andlogic had not brought him to his recollection what cries tom fault my dear coz and the garth in viewto her to her my boy said logic i am completelythroughout replied jerry and if you logic and thecorinthian do not lend me your assistance to expound ariddle the lady has left me i shall never be able to run herdown let us hear this riddle said tom logic is a goodhand at making out conundrums jerry then repeated tothem the sentences from the answers to which he was to takethe first letter it is more ike an acrostic than a riddleexclaimed the oxonian and i have no doubt we threeloggerheads can make it out but i think i know the ladywho is she asked jerry with great earnestness donot be in such a hurry replied logic it requires somelittle caution before i mention the name of any female i maybevery wrong to judge from the mere shape of a lady in disguise but the voice seemed familiar to me as i caught thelast sound of goodbye here the conversation was interruptedby one of the characters as a balladsinger amusing agroup of masquers with the following comic song to the masquerade we goto meet with fun and gig a masquerade supper but it often proves our woe i

saw sir richard wanton here said logic aud ihave no doubt the old flat has come to the masquerade toplease and humour his wife whom he is coaxingly fond ofthere is a great disparity of years between them it is almostjanuary and may but the immense fortune of sir richardi am well assured was the only attraction that obtained thehand of the lady backed by her parents as being a mostexcellent match as to love on her part pshaw but the oldboy can refuse her nothing and upon several occasions shehas made him look perfectly ridiculous if she has donenothing more than that said tom it is of no consequenceonly ridiculous bob is a mere bagatelle but jerry howdid you get into chat with her the nun replied hawthorn had lost her party and i caught her on the wingand promised to assist her to find them but there wassomething so witty and interesting belonging to her thatinstead of angrily telling herto go to a nunnery go that heaven had made her one faceand that she had made it anotherko no i am not so much out of temper with the fair sex but i strove gently to detain and amuse her and as she did when the countess of a lady eminently distinguished forthe propriety of her conduct and the mother of a once beautiful duchesscomplained to the duke of respecting her daughter's wearingsuch outoftheway high feathers that it was perfectly ridiculous thelaugh and tale of the whole town and as her daughter's husband shebegged of him to remonstrate with her on the folly and levity of herbehaviour the duke with a goodnatured smile on his face replied ithank your ladyship for the anxiety you have expressed on my accountand also for your feelings as a parent but if her grace does not put anythingupon my head to make it uncomfortable i cannot refuse her theliberty to decorate her own as she pleases life in londonnot seem very anxious to rejoin her party i endeavoured tomake the most of my time by pressing her for a meeting atsome future period in case her friends should come upon ussuddenly and i might in consequence be separated from herwithout obtaining the desired information very gallantindeed said logic and perhaps if you had personified donquixote here it would have been a more appropriate characterfor you but do you recollect anything particular about thedress or the person of the nun yes yes i do she isvery prominent about jerry whispering into the earof the oxonian

wandering from my previous subject observedlogic the fame of the lady i was first talking about wasnot confined to the metropohs alone she was equally anobject of attraction in all the great

independentin principle of that rank in the kingdom it is true there isa vast disparity of years between the parties but the proprietyof conduct observed by the lady united with real loveand

difference of the human character in the circlesof fashion you scarcely meet with any contrast whateveryou will recollect jerry said tom smiling they are allsporting characters and are all touched

logic with a prime grin on his face the loudbarking of the dogs the singularity of the remarks and theconfidence and ease with which every greasy hero or sooty chiefplaced himself by the side of the

with as much cunning as a prizefighter would doin order to repel the shock the dog immediately got himdown and turned him up but the monkey in an instantwith his teeth which met together like a saw

fewglasses of wine tom observed it was time to be off thecarriage was immediately ordered and in a very short timethe trio found themselves in the presence of the heroine of thetale tom was the master of the ceremonies upon this occasionand logic and jerey received a flattering smile on theirintroduction to kate when the latter without delay presentedto the notice of her visitors her companion the

in all hisremarks that decision seemed to rest upon his lips jerrythough not quite so eloquent as his two friends neverthelesscontributed with much humour towards the chitchat of the teatableif a horse a bird or a dog could have been cleverlyintroduced jerry would have shown himself a firstrate hero however his eyes had been sufficiently opened in his banishesand sprees with the corinthian and logic to see his waymore clearly upon the present occasion than he otherwise couldhave done kate highly attractive from her fine person andsuperior manners soon convinced the oxonian and jerry in the character of jeanie deans in the heart of midlothian asdramatised by t dibden esq that individual who can witness theexertions of miss taylor without shedding a tear must be made ofinflexible stuff

decorations alone she became an objectof attention and sue interesting from her loveliness andsimplicity made a much greater impression upon the surroundinggroup than all the art in the world could have done towardselevating her in the minds of the persons present such wasthe gay party assembled nay more it was a liberal oneit was most certainly a party with too many faults belongingto it but yet not a single absent friend or a neighbour wereserved up as a dish of scandal where every person presentcould help himself to a slice both logic and jerry had only'seen corinthian katem passant amidst the bustle and gay throng of the park andthey had yet to encounter the danger of her charms andfascinating attractions when increased from the advantages ofdress and heightened by the most lively and impressive talentsduring the chitchat at the teatable jerry could scarcely keephis eyes ofi kate hawthorn in consequence at timesblushed appeared confused was aware it was extremely vulgarknew that such conduct was wrong and also that it was notthe behaviour of a gentleman but above all that it wasacting unkind towards his friend and cousin yet in spite ofall these honourable feelings and checks which he endeavouredto keep upon himself he often transgressed into a downrightstare as if under the influence of some powerful magnet thathe could not resist for her own personit beggar'd all description o'er picturing that venus where we seethe fancy outwork naturethe oxonian too with all his experience in these matterswould have been equally at a loss to have known whatto have done with his optics as he afterwards remarkedkate and sue visit a fortuneteller if his green specs had not operated as a prime hedge for him and in all probability had not the corinthian been presentthe gallantry of logic would have tempted him to have repeatedthe words of the poet as a compliment to the mistressof his friend angels were painted fair to look like you upon the removal of the teathings very little time wassuffered to elapse before tom gave the hint to logic thatgay moments were too precious to be wasted the pianofortewas at his service and the company were anxiously waitingto hear him commence the harmony of the evening logicrequired no further invitation and immediately took his seatat the instrument but before he had half finished the air of when to lovely

of them displaying their various talents toprevent the intrusion of ennui or in other words to avoidthe had manners of looking at their watches lolling and to hedge off or it s a prime hedge for me are phrases repeatedlymade use of in the sporting world when an individual wishes to savehimself from any serious consequences life in l fond onyawning and picking their teeth which too often occurwhen time hangs heavy on the hands of a company destituteof abilitiesthe eloquence of jerry was not the worse for a few glassesof wine and logic very frequently turned round full ofhumour bidding his companions to keep time and to payattention to the man in the orchestra tom who had already'plied the oxonian with several bumpers handed him anotherglass of wine and observed with a smile that it would beimpossible to neglect a man of his great taste if ever time had passed merrily in any company it mightbe said to have positively flown away among this gay partypleasure was their idol it was the creature of their imagination and no heroes ever offered more sacrifices at its attractiveshrine than did our trio they were devotees to pleasuremorning noon and night logic at all times possessed somuch gaiety de cur that no assemblage of persons could bedull for an instant in his presence the corinthian wasequally so in disposition if not gifted with talents even of ahigher cast to amuse and interest a company and hawthornthe laughing goodnatured jerry if he could not chatter likea magpie ujjon all subjects that were introduced into conversationyet no one departed from his society with an impressionthat a dummy had taken his seat amongst themequally devoted to gaiety and pleasure were our heroines but the dispositions of corinthian kate and the lovely suewere diametrically opposite to each other kate was prouda cant phrase for a stupid fellow a man who has not a word to sayfor himself the family of the dummies is very numerouskate and sue visit a fortuneteller yet dignified commanding but polite and conscious of herown fine person and its powerful influence upon the oppositesex she left nothing untried that could tend to improve itshe could smile at a comic incident and shed tears over apathetic tale but it was more from the impulse of themoment than any deep impression they had made upon herfeelings and when these convulsive efforts had subsided theywere nearly forgotten by her for ever kate too was fondof accomplishments not precisely as accomplishments but onaccount of their commanding attention and under thisidea she had been actively industrious to make herself mistressof everything that could add to her importance she couldsing well dance elegantly was a proficient in music anadept at drawing a delightful scholar and the tout ensemblecompleted with

night but to use jerry's own words respecting the lovelysue he has often since been heard to remark what a vastdifference appeared between these two females while katesaid he has excited your astonishment from her dignitygrandeur and selfpossession the tenderness solicitude andanxiety to please portrayed by sue has interested every onein her behalf beyond description unconscious of the influencewhich her lovely person and beauty had upon her beholderszoiooookate and sue visit a fortuneteller she required not the aid of art to render it more effective butwhich tended to make her simplicity doubly captivatingthe mildness of sue's disposition was unfortunately the meansof her becoming a sacrifice to her designing protector sincerein her own professions of love she believed the emphatic vowsof her hero to be equally true and therefore had yielded tohis entreaties but in return sue found herself deceived forher generous unlimited affection she had not one grain ofharshness in her whole composition she could also boast ofaccomplishments equal to corinthian kate but sue wasmore reserved in displaying them as ambition did not fire herbrain to excel other females in beauty grandeur or talentsin short lovely sue partook more of the interesting tendercompanion than the highmotioned extravagant dashing mistressthe dispositions of our heroines not coming in contactwith each other they were intimate friends and kate wasextremely partial to sue who was her neighbour and also afrequent visitor females in general it should seem are notvery fond of introducing pretty women to the company oftheir male acquaintances but sue was viewed more in thelight of a pretty foil by corinthian irate than in the dangerouscharacter of a powerful rival it was under thisimpression that the lovely sue was invited to meet thetrioafter the oxonian had played several pieces of lively musiche requested as a favour that kate and his friend tom wouldhave the kindness to reform a waltz kate without anyhesitation immediately stood up tom offered his hand to hisfascinating partner logic struck up a favourite air whenthis lascivious dance took place the plate conveys a correctrepresentation of the gay scene at that precise moment theanxiety of the oxonian to witness the attitudes of this elegant life in londonpair had nearly put a stop to their movements on his turningrouni from the pianoforte and presenting his comical mug totheir notice crying out bravo t it was with the utmostdifficulty that kate could suppress a laugh it had such arisible effect upon her countenance and it was impossible forthe corinthian to assume anything like an air of gravity uponthis occasion jeery was too much attracted by the charmsof lovely sue to notice the above circumstance or even tospare the corner of one of his eyes to view the superior dancingof kate and tom his time being completely occupied insinging more after the style of incledon than abraham tothe interesting object before him when i gazed on a beautiful faceor a form that my fancy approved i was pleased with its sweetness and graceand falsely believed that i lovedper i could loot i could like i could leavebut i never loved any till nowas lovely sue was only a visitor like himself and not underthe immediate influence of any person present jerry thoughtthere was no bar to his saying a thousand civil things to her and more especially as she did not appear offended at any ofhis remarksnone of the company were starters and both irate and the lateness of the hour never had any influence upon the minds ofour trio while mirth was afloat and neither tom jebrt or logiccame under the denomination of starters i our heroes were too fond ofpleasure to lose a single atom of it and therefore they left it to theeequtaes the eleven and twelve o'clock sort of people who would notstay a minute longer for the world to break up the utiles of harmonyindeed it is very often experienced in society that when any person hastaken ha departure who had contributed in a great measure to thekate and sue visit a fortuneteller sue sang some delightful airs during the evening the songand the glass had also passed very briskly round between thetrio till the face of logic had assumed a shining aspect jerry was getting very merry and the corinthian quitefull of spirits was laughing at a small piece of torn paperwhich he had just picked up off the carpet and respectingwhich both kate and sue had denied having any knowledgeit contained the following sentences which tom read aloud mary devis begs leave to inform the ladies in general thatshe answers all sorts of difficult questions proposed to her inasatisfactory manner nativities cast c and is to be heardof this is some old fortuneteller i be swornsays tom and if i knew the direction jerry you and iwould pay her a morning visit come ladies do not be sounkind j give us the old hag's direction both kate andsue blushed with confusion but again denied any knowledgeof the circumstancelogic at length grew tired of performing on the pianoforteand having no other companion to engage his attention beggedleave that the odd one as he termed himself mightretire the lovely sue also proposed taking her departurewhen jerry with a squeeze of the hand insisted uponseeing her safe home thus it was the trio separated andfinished their gay moments for that sitting but undera general promise that they would have another meeting thefirst opportunitylogic according to promise kept his appointment tomirth and amusement of the evening a degree of flatness has

his praise at the superior style displayed bytom in the ornamental parade of quarte and tierce and also atthe coolness and skill exhibited by the corinthian in thegrand assault indeed said logic as an

display great ease andelegance in their attitudes mr o'shaunessy not only metwith a most flattering reception but he was pronounced acomplete master of the arton quitting the fencingrooms tom and jerry accompaniedlogic to the albany where they bid goodbye to theoxonian and in their way towards bedford square havingan appointment at that place hawthorn espied at a shortdistance before him in russell street kate and sue trippingit along as if in great haste jerry instantly mentioned thecircumstance to tom but the corinthian had scarcely caughta glimpse of their persons when they quickly turned down anobscure narrow street and if the curiosity of our heroes hadnot been strongly excited so as to give them a run for it theymust have lost sight of the ladies altogether having onlyturned the corner of the street time enough to witness theirentrance into a very shabby dirtylooking house jerry andtom soon approached it the door being open sans ceremoniethey ascended the stairs upon which a brush did not appear tohave been used for many a day and indeed they were nowso covered with mud that a shovel would have been a far moreappropriate article before any water could have reached theboards so as to restore them to anything like a decent appearanceour heroes however were not to be deterred in theirascent and they arrived at the top of the house it mustbe the fortuneteller's tom whispered to jerry the oldimpostor which the plate represents was imjiiig out thecards as she termed it to tell the fortunes of sue andkate but it appears she possessed no knowledge whatever of herown fortune when she was apprehended by the policelife in londonofficers and afterwards tried at the sessions house clerkenwell green and sentenced to six months imprisonment ofthe above punishment that was in store for the old hag hercards were so unkind to their mistress as never to give theleast hint this circumstance alone respecting the ignorance offortunetellers speaks volumes to the unwary but suchis the credulity of mankind that nothing can allay the thirstfor a peep into futurity kate and sue had fallen intobetween thirty and forty years since a woman of the name ofcoebtn resided in a very small house which she kept to herself nextdoor to the sign of the bricklayers arms in king's gate street lowbornwho at that period and for several years afterwards was in high reputeas a fortuneteller or cunning woman from her printed handbillswhich she had well circulated in the areas of houses belonging to noblemenand other persons of rank at the west end of the town and iuvarious parts of the metropolis in order to decoy the women and menservantsto have their fortunes told also that they might put these billsinto the hands of the daughters of their masters in which she set forththat she could give satisfactory answers to all questions respectingpersons at a distance either upon the sea or land cast the nativities ofindividuals resolve difficult points c this bill had the desiredeffect and mrs cokbtn carried on a roaring trade she was an extremelyignorant woman but really a cunning one so far as to cheat those personswho came to see her out of their money and although she could notread a book yet she could converse with the planets fluently neither hadmrs cokbtn the slightest knowledge of arithmetic but she was quiteexpert or pretended to be so in calculating nativities she however wasa bold confident woman and well knew the method of working upon thecredulity of the female sex in particular mrs cokbtn was no stranger tothe impression made upon the mind by stage effect and therefore theroom which individuals were ushered into by her servant was so darkenedas to produce a solemn and appalling appearance upon the stranger whoin general was left alone for about a minute the walls were covered withthe sun moon stars c painted in black for the visitor to contemplatethis sort of suspense had its importance when all of a sudden outpopped the cunning woman dressed in a corresponding style and in ankate and sue visit a fortuneteller this error and tom and jerky thus traced them into theold hag's apartment when the hearts of the ladies werebeating pitapat to hear the important secrets of their fateassumed tone of voice well calculated to excite fear in the breast of afemale demanded to know the nature of the inquiry if the lady wishedto be informed respecting persons at a distance then the cunning woman opened a large black book full of hieroglyphic characters which she pretendedto consult upon the subject and also pointed with her wand tothe stars uttering some incoherent expressions till she derived theinformation to humbug the suitor but if it was about getting a husbandand in what time then the cards were laid out and by way of a grandclimax if more money was advanced for mrs cokbyn had always anexcellent practice of being paid first she offered to show any female theexact kkeuess of her future husband if the person acquiesced mrscobbyn bid her not to be frightened in order to increase the effect of herarts and immediately she drew aside a curtain which discovered a largesquare of clear glass behind which was a narrow passage parted off fromthe room and a man whom she employed for the purpose as a confederate on mrs coebtn uttering a few cabalistic sounds totally unintelligible theconfederate would show his face and then vanish in an instant thispiece of deception which was well managed operated so strongly uponthe feelings of many of her tender visitors that they have not onlyscreamed out with terror but several have actually fallen down in faintingfitswhen any man wished to see his future wife she had also a confederatefemale to play the part mrs coebtn increased so rapidly inproperty that she was enabled to leave her obscure dwelling for a morecapacious respectable house which she had elegantly furnished in storestreet tottenhamcourt road and where she carried on her deception inhigh style laughing in her sleeve till she was ultimately routed by thepolice an impostor of a similar description also lived in the old baileyunder the denomination of a cunning inch about the same period andwithin the last fiveandtwenty years another hero of this class dwelt inthe neighbourhood of retinal green who was known by the appellationof the straw man this fellow had little figures made of straw whichin order to elude the pursuits of justice it was his practice before heopened his cunning lips to make his visitors purchase but at lengththe man of straw was tried and convicted as a rogue and a vagabond life in londonunfolded to them the plate sufficiently bespeaks the povertyof the hag's garret an old rug answered the double purposeof keeping out the cold and serving as a door through

to the eldest miss trifle and to recommend mycoz as a partner for her sister i shall consider it as a highhonour conferred upon us it was immediately agreed to and our heroes were enabled to join the dance without theassistance of the explanatory card the appearance of themarchioness was so brilliant from her display of diamondsthat jerry was nearly in want of the word lethe to calloff his attracted eyes to his lovely partner that stood beforehim the hon dick trifle formed one of the quadrille asthe plate represents but his female cousins had nothingtrifling attached to them excepting their name indeed onthe contrary they were superior girls handsome in their personsand interesting in their manners and jerry felt quitepleased that he had been so fortunate as to procure such anagreeable lady for his partner but the dance had scarcelycommenced when hawthorn perceived among the pros life in londonmenaces his fair incognita at the masquerade lastwanton the hitherto attractions of his partner were allforgotten in an instant he was on the frd and almost determinedto pursue her so strongly did he feel the impulse ofthe moment but his p's and q's had now returned to theirduty and whispered to him it would be highly improper todo so goodbreeding forbade it and the respect and attentionwhich were due to his partner required him to keep hisstation if he wished to support the character of a gentlemanpoor jerry now indeed felt the want of the card to point outto him the figure of the dance as his eyes instead of beingfixed on his partner were directed to the spot where ladywanton was walking the face of the latter heroine onsuddenly encountering our hero was of a crimson hue andinstantly in a confused state she obscured herself in thethickest part of the promenaders and was soon lost sight ofby hawthorn upon the conclusion of the dance our heroby way of an excuse complained of a slight sprain which hehad met with in his ankle and in consequence excused himselffrom waltzing with miss trifle being the best apologyhe could under such circumstances make to his lovely andengaging partner to prevent detection jerry was compelledto sit down though he would have taken to his heels if hecould have done so without observation and his eyes werewandering over the assembly in hopes of obtaining anotherglimpse of the lady in question but the bird had flown hehad not marked it down as heretofore and although as keena sportsman as ever entered a field he was liege completely atfault almack's had now lost its charms owing to thisdisappointment it was
