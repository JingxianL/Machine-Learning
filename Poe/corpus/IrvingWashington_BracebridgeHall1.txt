in again taking pen in hand i would fainmake a few observations at the outset by wayof bespeaking a right understanding the volumeswhich i have already published have metwith a reception far beyond my most sanguineexpectations i would willingly attribute this totheir intrinsic merits but in spite of the vanityof authorship i cannot but be sensible thattheir success has in a great measure beenowing to a less flattering cause it has been amatter of marvel at least to the t european partof my readers that a man from the wilds ofamerica should express himself in tolerableenglish i was looked upon as something newand strange in literature a kind of demisavagewith a feather in his hand instead of on his headvol i the authorand there was a curiosity to hear what such abeing had to say about civilized societythis novelty is now at an end and with it inall probability the feeling of indulgence whichit produced i must now expect to bear the scrutinyof sterner criticism and to be measured bythe same standard with contemporary writers and the very indulgence that has been shown tomy previous writings will cause these to betreated with the greater rigouri am aware that i often travel over a beatenground and treat of subjects that have been alreadydiscussed by abler pens indeed variousauthors have been mentioned as my models towhom i should feel flattered if i thought i borethe slightest resemblance i write after no modelthat i am conscious of and i write with noidea of imitation or competition in venturingoccasionally on subjects that have already beenalmost exhausted by english authors i do itnot with the presumption of challenging a comparisonbut because i trust there will be somenew interest given to them when discussed bythe author the pen of a stranger if therefore i shouldoccasionally be found dwelling with fondness ontopics that are trite and commonplace withthe reader i beg the circumstances under whichi write may be kept in recollection i havebeen born and brought up in a new country yet educated from infancy in the literature of anold one my mind has gradually been filledwith historical and poetical associations whichwere connected with places and manners andcustoms of europe but could rarely be appliedto those of my own country with a mind thuspeculiarly prepared the most trivial and commisplaced objects and scenes on first landingin europe were full of interest and noveltyindeed it is difficult to describe the whimsicalmedley of ideas that rush at once upon astranger in such peculiar predicament hefor the first time sees a world about which hehas been thinking in every stage of his existencethe recollections of infancy youth andmanhood of the nursery the school and thestudy come swarming upon him distracting the authorhis attention between great and little objectsand each perhaps producing equal delightsuch for instance was the odd confusion ofassociations that kept breaking upon me as ifirst approached london one of my earliestwishes had been to see it i had heard so muchof it in childhood i had read so much aboutit in the earliest books that had been put in myinfant hands i was familiar with the names ofits streets and squares and public places beforei knew those of my native city it was tomethe great centre of the world round whichevery thing seemed to revolve i recollect contemplatingso wistfully when a boy a paltrylittle print of the thames and london bridgeand st paul's that was in front of a magazine even the venerable woodcut of st john'sgate that has stood time out of mind on thetitle page of the gentleman's magazine wasnot without its charms for mehow my bosom thrilled when the towers ofwestminster abbey were pointed out to merising above the rich groves of st james'the author park with a thin blue haze about their graypinnaclesi could not behold this great mausoleum ofwhat is most illustrious in our paternal historywithout feeling all my enthusiasm in a glow nor can i forbear to mention on the other handthe delightful yet childish interest with which ifirst peeped into mr newbury's shop in stpaul's church yard that fountain head of literaturemr newbury was the first that everfilled my infant mind with the idea of a greatand good man he published all the picturebooks of the day tom thumb's folio gilesgingerbread and jack the giant killer andout of his abundant love for children he demandednothing for the paper and print andonly a penny halfpenny for the binding but what have most especially attracted myattention and have afforded a continually recurringsource of pleasure have been thosepeculiarities which distinguish an old countryand an old state of society from a new onei have never yet grown so familiar with the the authorcrumbling monuments of foregone ages as toblunt the intense interest with which i at firstbeheld them accustomed always to sceneswhere history was in a manner in anticipationwhere every thing in art was new and progressiveand where the works of man gave noideas but those of young existence and prospectiveimprovement there was somethinginexpressibly touching in these enormous pilesgray with antiquity and sinking to decay icannot describe the mute but deepest enjoymentwith which i have contemplated a vastmonastic ruin like enter abbey buried inthe bosom of a quiet valley as though it hadexisted merely for itself or a warrior pilelike conway castle standing in stern lonelinesson its rocky promontory a mere hollowyet threatening phantom of departed powerthey spread a grand and melancholy and tomean unusual charm over the landscapegiving proofs of the transient and perishingglories of art among the ever springing andreviving fertility of maturethe author in like manner have i been affected by everythingantique and obsolete in manners and customs and i mention these circumstances as anapology for often recurring to such themes andbetraying occasionally a provincial ignoranceand delight respecting them which must provokea smile from my wiser and more experiencedreader having been brought up also inthe comparative simplicity of a republic i amapt to be struck with even the ordinary circumstancesattendant on an aristocratical state ofsociety i have amused myself occasionallytherefore by pointing out some of the eccentricitiesand some of the poetical characteristicsof the latter without pretending to decide on itsmerits compared with any other form of governmentmy only aim is to paint manners andcharacters such as i see them i am no politicianthe more i have considered politicsthe more i have found it full of perplexity andas in religion i have contented myself with thefaith in which i have been brought up regulatingmy own conduct by its precepts but the authorleaving to abler heads the task of making convertsi shall continue on therefore in the course ihave hitherto pursued looking at things poeticallyrather than politically describing them asthey are rather than pretending to point outhow they should be and endeavouring to see theworld in as pleasant a light as circumstanceswill permiti have always had an opinion that much goodmight be done by keeping mankind in goodhumour with one another i may be wrongin my philosophy but i shall continue to practiseit until convinced of its fallacy when idiscover the world to be all that it has beenrepresented by sneering cynics and whiningpoets i will turn to and abuse it also in themean while worthy reader i hope you will notthink lightly of me because i cannot believethis to be so very bad a world as it is representedthine

halland cheering them from the shore a good outsetis half the voyagebefore proceeding any farther i would begthat the squire might not be confounded withthat class of hard riding fox hunting gentlemenso often described and in fact so nearlyextinct in england i use this rural title partlybecause it is his universal appellation throughoutthe neighbourhood and partly because itsaves me the frequent repetition of his name which is one of those rough old english namesat which frenchmen exclaim in despairthe squire is in fact a lingering specimenof the old english country gentleman rusticateda little by living almost entirely on hisestate and something of a humorist as englishmenare apt to become when they have anopportunity of living in their own way i likehis hobby passing well however which is abigotted devotion to old english manners andcustoms it jumps a little with my own humourhaving as yet a lively and unsated curiosityabout the ancient and genuine characteristicsof my father landthe hall there are some traits about this family alsowhich appear to me to be national it is one ofthose old aristocratical families which i believeare peculiar to england and scarcely understoodin other countries that is to say familiesof the ancient gentry who though destitute oftitled rank maintain a high ancestral pridewho look down upon all nobility of recentcreation and would consider it a sacrifice ofdignity to merge the venerable name of theirhouse in a modern titlethis feeling is very much fostered by theimportance which they enjoy in their hereditarydomains the family mansion is an old manorhouse standing in a retired and beautiful part ofyorkshire its inhabitants have been regardedthrough the surrounding country as the greatones of the earth and the little village nearthe hall looks up to the squire with almostfeudal homage i am again quartered in thepanelled chamber in the antique wing of thehouse the prospect from my window

songsand catches and such tricks and jigs you would admire he iswith him nowjovial crewby no one has my return to the hall beenmore heartily greeted than by mr simon bracebridgeor master simon as the squire mostcommonly calls him i encountered him just asi entered the park where he was breaking apointer and he received me with all the hospitablecordiality with which a man welcomes afriend to another one's house i have alreadyintroduced him to the reader as a brisk oldbachelor looking little man the wit and superannuatedbeau of a large family connexion andthe squire's factotum i found him as usualfull of bustle with a thousand petty things to the busy mando and persons to attend to and in chirpinggood humour for there are few happier beingsthan a busy idler that is to say a man who iseternally busy about nothingi visited him the morning after my arrivalin his chamber which is in a remote corner ofthe mansion as he says he likes to be to himselfand out of the way he has fitted it upin his own taste so that it is a perfect epitomeof an old bachelor's notions of convenience andarrangements the furniture is made up ofodd pieces from all parts of the house chosenon account of their suiting his notions or fittingsome corner of his apartment and he is veryeloquent in praise of an ancient elbow chair from which he takes occasion to digress into acensure on modern chairs as having degeneratedfrom the dignity and comfort of high backedantiquityadjoining to his room is a small cabinetwhich he calls his study here are some hangingshelves of his own construction on whichare several old works on hawking hunting andthe busy man farriery and a collection or two of poems andsongs of the reign of elizabeth which he studiesout of compliment to the squire together withthe novelist's magazine the sporting magazinethe racing slender a volume or two of thenewgate slender a book of peerage and anotherof heraldryhis sporting dresses hang on pegs in a smallcloset and about the walls of his apartment arehooks to hold his fishing tackle whips spursand a favourite fowling piece curiously wroughtand inlaid which he inherits from his grandfatherhe has also a couple of old singlekeyed flutes and a fiddle which he has repeatedlypatched and mended himself affirming itto be a veritable cremona though i have neverheard him extract a single note from it that wasnot enough to make one's blood run coldfrom this little nest his fiddle will often beheard in the stillness of midday drowsily sawingsome long forgotten tune for he prides himselfon having a choice collection of good old englishmusic and will scarcely have any thing to the busy mando with modern composers the time howeverat which his musical powers are of most useis now and then of an evening when he playsfor the children to dance in the hall and hepasses among them and the servants for a perfectorpheushis chamber also bears evidence of his variousavocations there are half copied sheetsof music designs for needlework sketches oflandscapes very indifferently executed a cameralucida a magic lanthorn for which he isendeavouring to paint glasses in a word it isthe cabinet of a man of many accomplishmentswho knows a little of every thing and doesnothing wellafter i had spent some time in his apartmentadmiring the ingenuity of his smallinventions he took me about the establishmentto visit the stables dog kennel and otherdependencies in which he appeared like ageneral visiting the different quarters of hiscamp as the squire leaves the control of allthese matters to him when he is at the hallthe busy man he inquired into the state of the horses examined their feet prescribed a drench forone and bleeding for another and then tookme to look at his own horse on the merits ofwhich he dwelt with great prolixity and whichi noticed had the best stall in the stableafter this i was taken to what he termed thefalconry to see a famous hawk which he wastraining for he told me he would show meina few days some rare sport of the good oldfashioned kind in the course of our round iremarked that the grooms gamekeeper whippersonand other retainers seemed all to be onsomewhat of a familiar footing with mastersimon and fond of having their joke withhim though it was evident they had greatdeference for his opinion in matters relating totheir functionsthere was one exception however in oldchristy a testy old huntsman as hot as a peppercorn a meagre wiry old fellow that seemedmade of buckram and whalebone he wore athreadbare velvet jockey cap and a pair ofvol i the bus it manleather breeches that from much wear shoneas though they had been japanned he wasvery contradictory and pragmatical and aptas i thought to differ from master simonnow and then out of mere captiousness thiswas particularly the case with respect to thetreatment of the hawk which master simoninsisted he would ruin if he went on as hewas doing the latter made a most pedanticclatter about casting and limping and gleamingand endearing and giving her the rangeabout all which i saw old christy knew aslittle as i did myself but notwithstanding hemaintained his point most doggedly and i wassurprised to see the good nature with whichmaster simon gave up to himmaster simon explained the matter to meafterwards old christy is the most ancientservant on the place having lived among dogsand horses the greater part of a century andbeen in the service of mr bracebridge's fatherhe knows the pedigree of every horse on theplace and has bestrode the great great grandthebusy man sires of most of them he can give a circumstantialdetail of every fox hunt for the last sixtyjor seventy years and has a history for everystag's head about the house and every huntingtrophy nailed to the door of the dog kennelall the present race have grown up underhis eye and humour him in his old age heonce attended the squire to oxford when hewas a student there and enlightened the wholeuniversity with his hunting lore all this isenough to make the old man opinionated sincehe finds on all these matters of first rate importancehe knows more than the rest of theworldindeed master simon had been his pupiland acknowledges that he derived his firstknowledge in hunting from the instructions ofold christy and i much question whether theold man does not still look upon him as rathera green hornon our return just as we were crossing thelawn in front of the hall we heard the porter'sbell ring at the lodge and shortly after a kindof cavalcade advanced slowly up the avenue the busy manon sight of it master simon paused and consideredit for a moment and then making asudden exclamation hurried away to meet itas it approached i discerned a fair fresh lookingelderly lady dressed in an old fashionedriding habit and a large white beaver hatwith a very broad brim she was riding ona white pony followed by a fat footman in richlivery mounted on an overfed hunter at alittle distance in the rear w r as an ancient cumbrouschariot drawn by two very corpulenthorses and driven by as corpulent a coachmanbeside whom sat a page dressed in fancifulgreen livery inside of the chariot was astarched prim figure with a look somewhatbetween a lady's companion and a lady's maid and a pampered cur was perched at each windowthere was a general turning out of the garrisonat the hall to receive this new comerthe squire assisted her to alight and salutedher affectionately on each cheek the fair juliaflew into her arms and they embraced with thethe busy man romantic fervour of boarding school friends shewas escorted into the house by julia's lover towardswhom she showed distinguished favour and a line of the old servants who had collectedin the hall bowed most profoundly as she passedi observed that master simon was extremelyassiduous in his attentions upon this old ladyhe walked by the side of her pony up the avenue and while she was receiving the salutationsof the rest of the family he took occasion tonotice the fat old coachman to pat the sleekcarriage horses and above all to say a civilword to my lady's gentlewoman the prim sourlooking vestal in the chariot i had no moreof his company for the rest of the morninghe was swept off in the vortex that followedin the wake of this lady once indeed hepaused for a moment as he was hurrying byme on some errand of the good lady's to let meknow that this was lady lillycraft a sister ofthe squire's of large fortune which the captainwould inherit and that her estate lay inone of the best hunting countries in all england family servantsverily old servants are the vouchers of worthy housekeepingthey are like rats in a mansion or mites in a cheese bespeaking theantiquity and fatness of their abodein my casual anecdotes of the hall i mayoften be tempted to dwell on circumstances ofa trite and trivial nature from their appearingto me illustrative of genuine national characterit seems to be the study of the squire to adhereas much as possible to what he considers the oldlandmarks of english manners his servantsall understand his ways and for the most parthave been accustomed to them from infancy so that upon the whole his household presentsone of the few tolerable specimens that can nowbe met with of the establishment of an englishcountry gentleman of the old schoolby the bye the servants are not the leastcharacteristic part of the household thefamily servants housekeeper for instance has been born andbrought up at the hall and has never beentwenty miles from it yet she has a stately airthat would not disgrace a lady that had figuredat the court of queen elizabeth am half inclined to think that she has caughtit from living so much among the old familypictures it may however be owing to a consciousnessof her importance in the sphere inwhich she has always moved for she is greatlyrespected in the neighbouring village and amongthe farmer's wives and has high authority inthe household ruling over the servants withquiet but undisputed swayshe is a thin old lady with blue eyes andpointed nose and chin her dress is alwaysthe same as to fashion she wears a smallwell starched ruff a laced stomacher full petticoatsand a gown festooned and open infront which on particular occasions is of ancientsilk the legacy of some former dame ofthe family or an inheritance from her motherwho was housekeeper before her i have areverence for these old garments as i make no family servantsdoubt they have figured about these apartmentsin days long past when they have set off thecharms of some peerless family beauty and ihave sometimes looked from the old housekeeperto the neighbouring portraits to seewhether i could not recognize her antiquatedbrocade in the dress of some one of those longwaisted dames that smile on me

portrait in the picture galleryand is a complete family chronicleshe is treated with great consideration by thesquire indeed master simon tells me thatthere is a traditional anecdote current among theservants of the squire's having been seen kissingher in the picture gallery when they werefamily servants both young as however nothing farther wasever noticed between them the circumstancecaused no great scandal only she was observedto take to reading pamela shortly afterwardsand refused the hand of the village inn keeperwhom she had previously smiled onthe old butler who was formerly footmanand a rejected admirer of her's used to tell theanecdote now and then at those little cabalsthat will occasionally take place among the mostorderly servants arising from the common propensityof the governed to talk against administration but he has left it off of late years sincehe has risen into place and shakes his head rebukinglywhen it is mentioned it is certainthat the old lady will to this day dwell on thelooks of the squire when he was a young manat college and she maintains that none of hissons can compare with their father when he wasof their age and was dressed out in his full suitof scarlet with his hair crape and powderedand his three cornered hatshe has an orphan niece a pretty soft heartedvol i family servantsbaggage named phoebe wilkins who has beentransplanted to the

a large ironbound coffer in her roomwhich are supposed by the housemaids to holdtreasures of wealth family servants the old lady is a great friend of master simon's who indeed pays a little court to her asto a person high in authority and they havemany discussions on points of family historyin which notwithstanding his extensive informationand pride of knowledge he commonlyadmits her superior accuracy he seldom returnsto the hall after one of his visits to theother branches of his family without bringingmistress wilkins some remembrance from theladies of the house where he has been stayingindeed all the children of the house look uptothe old lady with habitual respect and attachmentand she seems almost to considerthem as her own from their having grown upunder her eye the oxonian however is herfavourite probably from being the youngest though he is the most mischievous and has beenapt to play tricks upon her from boyhoodi cannot help mentioning one little ceremonywhich i believe is peculiar to the hall afterthe cloth is removed at dinner the old housekeepersails into the room and stands behind the family servantssquire's chair when he fills her a glass of winewith his own hands in which she drinks thehealth of the company in a truly respectful yetdignified manner and then retires the squirereceived the custom from his father and has alwayscontinued itthere is a peculiar character about the servantsof old english families that reside principally inthe countrythey have a quiet orderly respectful modeof doing their duties they are always neat intheir persons and appropriately and if i mayuse the phrase technically dressed they moveabout the house without hurry or noise there isnothing of the bustle of employment or the voiceof command nothing of that obtrusive housewiferythat amounts to a torment you are notpersecuted by the process of making you comfortableyet every thing is done and is donewell the work of the house is performed as ifby magic but it is the magic of system nothingis done by fits and starts nor at awkwardseasons the whole goes on like welloiled clockfamilyservants work where there is no noise nor jarring in itsoperationsenglish servants in general are not treatedwith great indulgence nor rewarded by manycommendations for the english are laconic andreserved towards their domestics but an approvingnod and a kind word from master or mistressgoes as far here as an excess of praise or indulgenceelsewhereneither do servants often exhibit any animatedmarks of affection to their employers yet thoughquiet they are strong in their attachments and thereciprocal regard of masters and servants thoughnot ardently expressed is powerful and lasting inold english familiesthe title of an old family servant carrieswith it a thousand kind associations in all partsof the w r old and there is no claim upon thehomebred charities of the heart more irresistiblethan that of having been born in thehouse it is common to see grayheaded domesticsof this kind attached to an englishfamily of the old school who continue in it family servantsto the day of their death in the enjoyment ofsteady unaffected kindness and the performanceof faithful unofficious duty i think such instancesof attachment speak well for both masterand servant and the frequency of themspeaks well for national characteri have met with several instances of epitaphson the grave stones of such valuable domesticsrecorded with the simple truth of natural feelingi have two before me at this momentone copied from a tombstone of a

upon the ways of man andeke of woman to such a man i say there issomething very entertaining in noticing the conductof a pair of young lovers it may not be asgrave and scientific a study as the loves of theplants but it is certainly as interestingi have therefore derived much pleasure sincemy arrival at the hall from observing the fairjulia and her lover she has all the delightfulblushing consciousness of an artless girl inexthe lovers experienced in coquetry who has made her firstconquest while the captain regards her withthat mixture of fondness and exultation withwhich a youthful lover is apt to contemplate sobeauteous a prize i observed them yesterdayin the garden advancing along one of the retiredwalks the sun was shining with deliciouswarmth making great masses of bright verdureand deep blue shade the cuckoo that harbingerof spring was faintly heard from a distance the thrush piped from the hawthorn andthe yellow butterflies sported and toyed and coquettedin the airthe fair julia was leaning on her lover's armlistening to his conversation with her eyes castdown a soft blush on her cheek and a quiet smileon her lips while in the hand that hung negligentlyby her side was a bunch of flowers inthis way they were sauntering slowly along andwhen i considered them and the scene in whichthey were moving i could not but think it athousand pities that the season should everchange or that young people should ever growvol i the loversolder or that blossoms should give way to fruit or that lovers should ever get marriedfrom what i have gathered of family anecdotei understand that the fair julia is the daughterof a favourite college friend of the squire's whoafter leaving oxford had entered the army andserved for many years in india where he wasmortally wounded in a skirmish with the nativesin his last moments he had with a faltering penrecommended his wife and daughter to the kindnessof his early friendthe widow and her child returned to englandhelpless and almost hopeless when mr bracebridgereceived accounts of their situation hehastened to their relief he reached them justintime to soothe the last moments of themother who was dying of a consumption andto make her happy in the assurance that her childshould never want a protectorthe good squire returned with his prattlingcharge to his strong hold where he had broughther up with a tenderness truly paternal as hehas taken some pains to superintend her educatelovers tion and form her taste she has grown up withmany of his notions and considers him the wisestas well as the best of men much of her timetoo has been passed with lady lillycraft whohas instructed her in the manners of the old schooland enriched her mind with all kinds of novelsand romances indeed her ladyship has had agreat hand in promoting the match between juliaand the captain having had them together ather country seat the moment she found therewas an attachment growing up between them the good lady being never so happy as when shehas a pair of turtles cooing about heri have been pleased to see the fondness withwhich the fair julia is regarded by the old servantsat the hall she has been a pet with themfrom childhood and every one seems to lay someclaim to her education so that it is no wonderthat she should be extremely accomplishedthe gardener taught her to rear flowers ofwhich she is extremely fond old christy thepragmatical huntsman softens when she approachesand as she sits lightly and graceful the loversin her saddle claims the merit of having taughther to ride while the housekeeper who almostlooks upon her as a daughter intimates that shefirst gave her an insight into the mysteries ofthe toilette having been dressing maid in heryoung days to the late mrs bracebridge i aminclined to credit this last claim as i have noticedthat the dress of the young lady had anair of the old school though managed with nativetaste and that her hair was put up verymuch in the style of sir peter lely's portraitsin the picture galleryher very musical attainments partake of thisold fashioned character and most of her songsare such as are not at the present day to befound on the piano of a modern performer ihave however seen so much of modern fashionsmodern accomplishments and modern fine ladiesthat i relish this tinge of antiquated stylein so young and lovely a girl and i have had asmuch pleasure in hearing her warble one of theold songs of herrick or carew or sucklingadapted to some simple old melody as i have hadthe lovers from listening to a lady amateur sky lark it upand down through the finest bravura of rossinior mozartwe have very pretty music in the eveningsoccasionally between her and the captain assistedsometimes by master simon who scrapesdubiously on his violin being very apt to getout and to halt a note or two in the rearsometimes he even thrums a little on the pianoor takes a part in a trio in which his voice cangenerally be distinguished by a certain quaveringtone and an occasional false notei was praising the fair julia's performanceto him after one of her songs when i found hetook the whole credit of having formed hermusical taste

piteousshe would weep if that she saw a mousecaught in a trap if it were dead or bled of small hounds had she that she fedwith most flesh mile and waste breadbut sore wept she if any of them were deador if men smote them with a yard smartchauceri am much better pleased with lady lillycraftthan i fancied i should have been notwithstandingthe little parade of her arrival shehas none of the petty stateliness that i imagined but on the contrary she has a degree of naiveteand simpleheartedness if i may use the phrasethat mingles well with her old fashioned mannersand harmless ostentation she dresses inrichsilks with long waist she rouges considerablyand her hair tvhich is nearly white is frizzedout and put up with pins her face is pitthewidow ted with the small pox but the delicacy of herfeatures shows that she once may have beenbeautiful and she has a very fair and well proportionedhand and arm of which if i mistakenot the good lady is still a little vain i have hadthe curiosity to gather a few particulars concerningher she was a great belle in town betweenthirty and forty years since and reigned for twoseasons with all the insolence of beauty refusingseveral excellent offers when she was unfortunatelyrobbed of her charms and her loversby an attack of the small pox she retired immediatelyinto the country where she sometimeafter inherited an estate and married abaronet a

tired of her when he broke his neck in afox chase and left her free rich and disconsolateshe has remained on her estate in thecountry ever since and has never shown any the widowdesire to return to town and revisit the scene ofher early triumphs and fatal malady all herfavourite recollections however revert to thatshort period of her youthful beautyshe has no idea of town but as it was at thattime and continually forgets that the place andpeople must have changed materially in half acentury she will often speak of the toasts ofthose days as if still reigning and until veryrecently used to talk with delight of the royalfamily and the beauty of the young princes andprincesses she cannot be brought to think ofthe present king other than as an elegant youngman rather wild but who danced a minuet divinely and before he came to the crownwould often mention him as the sweet youngprinceshe talks of the walks in kensington gardenswhere the gentlemen appeared in goldlacecoats and cocked hats and the ladies inhoops and swept so proudly along the grassyavenues and she thinks the ladies let themselvessadly down in their dignity when they gave upthe widow cushioned head dresses and high heeled shoesshe has much to say too of the officers whowere in the train of her admirers and speaksfamiliarly of many wild young blades that arenow perhaps hobbling about watering placeswith crutches and gouty shoeswhether the taste the good lady had of matrimonydiscouraged her or not i cannot saybut though her merits and her riches have attractedmany suitors she has never been temptedto venture

reliquesis very careful in collecting and preserving allfamily reliques the hall is full of remembrancesof the kind in looking about the establishmenti can picture to myself the character and habitsthat have prevailed at different eras of the familyhistory i have mentioned on a former occasionthe armour of the crusader which hangsup in the hall there are also several jackbootswith enormously thick soles and highheels that belonged to a set of cavaliers whofilled the hall with the din and stir of arms duringthe time of the covenanters a number ofenormous drinking vessels of antique fashionwith huge venice glasses and green hock glasseswith the apostles in relief on then remain asmonuments of a generation or two of hard liversthat led a life of roaring revelry and first introduce the gout into the familyi shall pass over several more such indicationsof temporary tastes of the squire's predecessors but i cannot forbear to notice a pair ofantlers in the great hall which is one of thetrophies of a hardriding squire of former timesfamily reliques who was the nimrod of these parts there aremany traditions of his wonderful feats in huntingstill existing which are related by oldchristy the huntsman who gets into a terriblepassion if they are in the least doubted indeedthere is a frightful chasm a few miles fromthe hall which goes by the name of the squire'sleap from his having cleared it in the ardour ofthe chase there can be no doubt of the fact forold christy shows the very dents of the horse'shoofs on the rocks on each side of the chasmmaster simon holds the memory of thissquire in great veneration and has a number ofextraordinary stories to tell concerning himwhich he repeats at all hunting dinners and iam told that they wax more and more marvellousthe older they grow he has also a pairof ripon spurs which belonged to this mightyhunter of yore and which he only wears on particularoccasionsthe place however which abounds mostwith mementos of past times is the picture gallery and there is something strangely pleasing family reliquesthough melancholy in considering the long rowsof portraits which compose the greater part ofthe collection they furnish a kind of narrativeof the lives of the family worthies which iam enabled to read with the assistance of thevenerable housekeeper who is the family chroniclerprompted occasionally by master simonthere is the progress of a fine lady for instancethrough a variety of portraits one representsher as a little girl with a long waist and hoopholding a kitten in her arms and ogling thespectator out of the corners of her eyes as ifshe could not turn her head in another wefind her in the freshness of youthful beautywhen she was a celebrated belle and so hardheartedas to cause several unfortunate gentlemento run desperate and write bad poetry inanother she is depicted as a stately dame in thematurity of her charms next to the portrait ofher husband a gallant colonel in fullbottomedwig and gold laced hat who was killed abroad and finally her monument is in the church thespire of which may be seen from the window family reliques where her effigy is carved in marble

age who flourished about a century sinceand if i may judge from their portraits wereextremely beautiful i can imagine what ascene of gayety and romance this old mansionmust have been when they were in the heydayof their charms when they passed like beautifulvisions through its halls or stepped daintilyto music in the revels and dances of the cedargallery or printed with delicate feet the

discoveredabout the place several faint records of this reignof love and romance when the hall was a kindof court of beautyseveral of the old romances in the library havemarginal notes expressing

the black blood of pagan christians converted a few infidels with it but let that passthe ordinarythe hall was thrown into some little agitationa few days since by the arrival of generalharbottle he had been expected for several days and had been looked for rather impatientlyby several of the family master simonassured me that i would like the generalhugely for he was a blade of the old schooland an excellent table companion lady lilyalso appeared to be somewhat flutteredon the morning of the general's arrival for hehad been one of her early admirers and sherecollected him only as a dashing young ensignjust come upon the town she actuallyspent an hour longer at her toilette and madean old soldier her appearance with her hair uncommonly frizzedand powdered and an additional quantity ofrouge on her face she was evidently a littlesurprised and shocked therefore at finding thelittle dashing ensign transformed into a corpulentold general with a double chin though itwas a perfect picture to witness their salutations the graciousness of her profound curtseyand the air of the old school with which thegeneral took off his hat swayed it gently in hishand and bowed his powdered headall this bustle and anticipation has causedme to study the general with a little more attentionthan perhaps i should otherwise havedone and the few days that he has alreadypassed at the hall have enabled me i think tofurnish a tolerable likeness of him to the readerhe is as master simon observed a soldier ofthe old school with powdered head side locksand pig tail his face is shaped like the sternof a dutch man of war narrow at top and wideat bottom with full rosy cheeks and a doublechin so that to use the cant of the day his an old soldierorgans of eating may be said to be powerfullydeveloped the general though a veteran hasseen very little active service except the takingof seringapatam which forms an era in his historyhe wears a large emerald in his bosomand a diamond on his finger which he got onthat occasion and whosoever is unlucky enoughto notice either is sure to involve himself in thewhole history of the siege to judge from thegeneral's conversation the taking of seringapatamis the most important affair that has occurredfor the last centuryon the approach of warlike times on the continenthe was rapidly promoted to get him outof the way of younger officers of merit untilhaving been hoisted to the rank of general hewas quietly laid on the shelf since that timehis campaigns have been principally confined towatering places where he drinks the waters for aslight touch of the liver which he got in india and plays whist with old dowagers with whomhe has flirted in his younger days indeed he talksof all the fine women of the last half century an old soldier and according to hints which he now and thendrops has enjoyed the particular smiles ofmany of themhe has seen considerable garrison duty andcan speak of almost every place famous forgood quarters and where the inhabitants givegood dinners he is a diner out of first ratecurrency when in town being invited to oneplace because he has beenseen at another inthe same way he is invited about to countryseats and can describe half the seats in thekingdom from actual observation nor is anyonebetter versed in court gossip and the pedigreesand intermarriages of the nobilityas the general is an old bachelor and an oldbeau and there are several ladies at the hallespecially his quondam flame lady jocelynehe is put rather upon his gallantry he commonlypasses some time therefore at his toiletteand takes the field at a late hour everymorning with his hair dressed out and powderedand a rose in his button hole after hehas breakfasted he walks up and down the tervoli an old soldierrace in the sunshine humming an air andhemming between every stave carrying onehand behind his back and with the other touchinghis cane to the ground and then raising itup to his shoulder should he in these morningpromenades meet any of the elder ladies ofthe family as he frequently does lady jocelynehis hat is immediately in his hand and it isenough to remind one of those courtly groupsof ladies and gentleman in old prints of windsor terrace or kensington gardenhe talks frequently about the service andis fond of humming the old songwhy soldiers whyshould we be melancholy boys why soldiers whywhose business tis to die i cannot discover however that the general hasever run any great risk of dying except froman apoplexy or an indigestion he criticises allthe battles on the continent and discusses themerits of the commanders but never fails tobring the conversation ultimately to tippooan old soldier saib and seringapatam he insists that bonapartewas no general and that he was a greatcoward for running away from the army afterthe battle of leipsic and for not putting himselfin the way of being shot on the field ofwaterloo i am told that the general was a perfectchampion at drawing rooms parades andwatering places during the late war and waslooked to with hope and confidence by many anold lady when labouring under the terror ofbonaparte's invasionhe is thoroughly loyal and attends punctuallyon levees when in town he has treasuredup many sayings of the late king's particularlyone which the king made to him on afield day complimenting him on the excellenceof his horse he extols the whole royal familybut especially the present king whom he pronouncesthe most perfect gentleman and bestwhist player in europethe general swears rather more than is thefashion of the present day but it was the modein the old school he is however very strict an old soldierin religious matters and a staunch churchmanhe repeats the responses very loud in churchand is emphatically in praying for the king androyal familythe general is amazingly well contentedwith the present state of things and with everythingabout him he goes about from dinnerto dinner and country seat to country seat andwonders how people can be dissatisfied in acountry where a man has nothing to do but todine out at other people's expense and to loll onsofas he is a thorough disbeliever in alltales about national ruin and public distresseswhich he insists upon it are all got up by theradicals and as to the poor he swears they allstarve out of mere idleness or to bring the ministryinto disgracehis loyalty waxes more fervent with his secondbottle and the song of god save theking puts him into an ecstacyhis heart brimmed over with patriotism andgood feeding this very day at dinner as he castan old soldier his eyes about the ample board loaded withluxuriesthey talk of public distress said the generalto me as he smacked a glass of rich burgundy but where do we find it

theyare as quiet as lambs when they fall singly intothe clutches of a fine womanin spite of the general's years he evidentlyis a little vain of his person and ambitious ofconquests i have observed him

speak his mind very freelyover his bottle about the folly of the captain intakinga wife as he thinks a young soldier shouldcare for nothing but his bottle and kind landlady but in fact he says the

were merelyconfinedto the general but i fear he will betheruin of my friend master simon who alreadybegins to echo his heresies and to talk in thestyle of a gentleman that has seen life and bachelorslived upon the town indeed he seems to havetaken master simon in hand and talks of showinghim the lions in london next season and ofintroducing him to the mulligatawney club asheis

feverlest this formidable rival should take the fieldbefore him shortly after my arrival at thehall i called at the parsonage in companywith mr bracebridge and the general theparson had not been seen for several dayswhich was a matter of some surprise as hewas an almost daily visiter at the hall wefound him in his study a small dusky chamberlighted by a lattice window that looked into thechurch yard and was overshadowed by a yewtree his chair was surrounded by folios andquartos piled upon the floor and his table wascovered with books and manuscripts thea literary antiquary cause of his seclusion was a work which hehad recently received and with which he hadretired in rapture from the world and shut himselfup to enjoy a literary honey moon undisturbednever did boarding school girl devourthe pages of a sentimental novel or don quixotea chivalrous romance with more intense delightthan did the little man banquet on thepages of this delicious work it was dibdin'sbibliographical

the expeditions to africa or the north polethe work had realized all his anticipationshe had been transported in idea to the librariesof the old german convents and universities a literary

tinted leather locked up in wirecases and secured from the vulgar hands of themere reader and to continue the happy expressionsof an ingenious w r river dazzlingone's eyes like eastern beauties peering throughtheir jealousieswhen the parson had finished a rapturouseulogy on this most curious and entertainingwork he drew forth from a little drawer amanuscript lately received from a correspondentwhich had perplexed him sadly it was writtenin norman french in very ancient charactersand so faded and smouldered away as to be almostillegible it was apparently an old normandrinking song that might have been broughtover by one of william the conqueror's carousingfollowers the writing was just legibledisraeli's curiosities of literaturea literary antiquary illenough to keep a keen antiquity hunter on adoubtful chace here and there would be a fewwords so plainly written as to put him on thescent again in this way he had been led onfor a whole day until he had found himself completelyat faultthe squire endeavoured to assist him butwas equally baffled the old general listenedfor some time to the discussion and then askedthe parson if he had read captain morris orgeorge stevens or anacreon moore's bacchanaliansongs on the other's replying in the negative oh then said the general with infinitebon homme if you want a drinking songi can furnish you with the latest collectioni did not know you had a turn for those kind ofthings and i can lend you the encyclopaediaof wit into the bargain i never travel withoutthem they're excellent reading at an innit would be difficult to describe the odd lookof surprise and perplexity of the parson onthis proposal or the difficulty that the squirehad in making the general comprehend that a literary antiquarythough a

by his wife a notable motherlywoman and a complete pattern for wives sinceaccording to master simon's account she nevercontradicts honest jack and yet manages to haveher own way and to control him in everythingshe received us in the main room of the housea kind of parlour and hall with great brownbeams of timber across it which tibbets is aptto point out with some exultation observing thatthey don't put such timber in houses nowadaysthe furniture was old fashioned strong andhighly polished the walls were hung with colouredprints of the story of the prodigal sonwho was represented in a red

with a varietyof household dainties so that we were glad tocompound by tasting some of her homemadewines while we were there the son and heirapparent came home a good looking young fellowand something of a rustic beau he tookus over the premises and showed us the wholeestablishment an air of homely but substantialplenty prevailed throughout every thingwas of the jest materials and in the best

his father he gaveus several particulars concerning his habits whichwere pretty much to the effect of those i havealready mentioned he had never suffered anaccount to stand in his life always providing themoney before he purchased any thing and ifpossible paying in gold and silver he had agreat dislike to paper money and seldom wentwithout a considerable sum in gold about himon my observing that it was a wonder he hadnever been waylaid and robbed the young fellowsmiled at the idea of any one venturing uponsuch an exploit for i believe he thinks the oldman would be a match for

counsellor and confidantwe had not been long at the farm before theold dame got him into a corner of her parlourwhere they had a long whispering conferencetogether in which i saw by his shrugs that therewere some dubious matters discussed and by hisnods that he agreed with every thing she saidafter we had come out the young man accompaniedus a little distance and then drawingmaster simon aside

favourite evening pastime at the hall andone which the worthy squire is fond of promotingis story telling a good old fashionedfireside amusement as he terms it indeed ibelieve he promotes it chiefly

withal with a nincompoopfor a husband as shrews are apt to have sherated the servants roundly for their negligencein sending up so bad a breakfast but said not aword against the stout gentleman by

graciously received at least therewas no further complainti had not made many turns about the traveller'sroom when there was another ringingshortly afterwards there was a stir and an inquestabout the

suspected him of being a radicalhunt i had heard was a large man whoknows thought i but it is hunt himselfmy curiosity began to be awakened i inquiredof the waiter who was this stout gentlemanthat was making all this stir but i couldget no information nobody seemed to knowhis name the landlords of bustling inns seldomtrouble their heads about the names of theirtransient guests the colour of a coat theshape or sifee of the person is enough to suggest atravelling name it is either the tall gentlemanor the short gentleman or the gentleman inblack or the gentleman in snuff colour or as inthe

to my room i had notbeen there long when there was a squall from aneighbouring bed room a door opened andslammed violently a chambermaid that i hadremarked for a ruddy good humoured face wentdown stairs in a violent flurry the stout gentlemanhad been rude to herthis sent a whole host of my deductions tothe deuce in a moment this unknown personagecould not be an old gentleman for old gentlemenare not apt to be so obstreperous to chambermaidshe could not be a young gentleman for young gentleman are not apt to inspiresuch indignation he must be a middle aged the stout gentlemanman and confoundedly ugly into the bargain orthe girl would not have taken the matter in suchterrible dudgeon i confess i was sorely puzzledin a few minutes i heard the voice of mylandlady i caught a glance of her as she cametramping up stairs her face glowing her capflaring her tongue wagging the whole wayshe'd have no such doings in her house she'dwarrant if gentlemen did spend their moneyfreely it was no rule she'd have no servantmaids of her's treated in that way when theywere about their work that's what she wouldn'tas i hate squabbles particularly with womenand above all with pretty women i slunk backinto my room and partly closed the door butmy curiosity was too much excited not to listenthe landlady marched intrepidly to the enemy'scitadel and entered it with a storm the doorclosed after her i heard her voice in high windyclamour for a moment or two then it graduallysubsided like a gust of wind in a garretthen there was a laugh then i heard nothingmore after a little while my landlady camethe stout gentleman out with an odd smile on her face adjusting hercap which was a little on one side as she wentdown stairs i heard the landlord ask her whatwas the matter she said nothing at allonly the girl's a fool i was more than everperplexed what to make of this unaccountablepersonage who could put a goodnatured chambermaidin a passion and send away a termagantlandlady in smiles he could npt be soold nor cross nor ugly eitheri had to go to work at his picture again andto paint him entirely different i now set himdown for one of those stout gentlemen that arefrequently met with swaggering about the doorsof country inns moist merry fellows in belcher handkerchiefs whose bulk is a little assistedby malt liquors men who have seen the worldand been sworn at highgate who are usedto tavern life up to all the tricks of tapstersand knowing in the ways of sinful publicansfree livers on a small scale who are prodigalwithin the compass of a guinea who call all thewaiters by name tousle the maids gossip withvol i the stout gentlemanthe landlady at the bar and prose over a pint ofport or a glass of negus after dinnerthe morning wore away in forming these andsimilar surmises as fast as i wove one systemof belief some movement of the unknown wouldcompletely overturn it and throw all my thoughtsagain into confusion such are the solitary operationsof a feverish mind i was as i havesaid extremely nervous and the continual meditationon the concerns of this invisible personagebegan to have its effect i was getting a fit ofthe fidgetsdinner time came i hoped the stout gentlemanmight dine in the traveller's room and thati might at length get a view of his person butno he had dinner served in his own roomwhat could be the meaning of this solitude andmystery he could not be a radical therewas something too aristocratical in thus keepinghimself apart from the rest of the world andcondemning himself to his own dull companythroughout a rainy day and then too he livedi too well for a discontented politician he seemedthe stout gentleman to expatiate on a variety of dishes and to sitover his wine like a jolly friend of good livingindeed my doubts on this head were soon atan end for he could not have finished his firstbottle before i could faintly hear him humminga tune and on listening i found it to be godsave the king twas plain then he was noradical but a faithful subject one that grewloyal over his bottle and was ready to stand byking and constitution when he could stand bynothing else but who could he be myconjectures began to run wild was he not somepersonage of distinction travelling incoggod knows said i at my wit's end itmay be one of the royal family for aught iknow for they are all stout gentlemen the weather continued rainy the mysteriousunknown kept his room and as far as i couldjudge his chair for i did not hear him movein the mean time as the day advanced the traveller'sroom began to be frequented somewho had just arrived came in buttoned up inbox coats others came home who had been the stout gentlemandispersed about the town some took their dinnersand some their tea had i been in a differentmood i should have found entertainmentin studying this peculiar class of men therewere two especially who were regular wags ofthe road and up to all the standing jokes of travellersthey had a thousand sly things to sayto the waiting maid whom they called louisaand ethelinda and a dozen other fine names changing the name every time and chucklingamazingly at their own waggery my mindhowever had become completely engrossed bythe stout gentleman he had kept my fancy inchace during a long day and it was not now tobe diverted from the scentthe evening gradually wore away thetravellers read the papers two or three times oversome drew round the fire and told long storiesabout their horses about their adventures theiroverturns and breaking down they discussedthe credits of different merchants and differentinns and the two wags told several choice anecdotesof pretty chambermaids and kind landladiesthe stout gentleman all this passed as they were quietly taking whatthey called their night caps that is to saystrong glasses of brandy and water with sugar orsome other mixture of the kind after which theyone after another rang for boots and the chambermaidand walked up to bed in old shoes cutdown into marvellously uncomfortable slippersthere was only one man left a short leggedlongbodied plethoric fellow with a very largesandy head he sat by himself with a glass ofport wine negus and a spoon sipping and stirringuntil nothing was left but the spoon hegradually fell asleep bolt upright in his chairwith the empty glass standing before him andthe candle seemed to fall asleep too for the wickgrew long and black and cabbaged at the endand dimmed the little light that remained in thechamberthe gloom that now prevailed was contagiousaround hung the shapeless and almostspectral box coats of departed travellers longsince buried in deep sleep i only heard theticking of the clock with the deepdrawn breathethe stout gentlemankings of the sleeping toper and the drippings ofthe rain dropdropdrop from the ears of thehousethe church bells chimed midnight all atonce the stout gentleman began to walk overheadpacing slowly backwards and forwardsthere was something extremely awful in all thisespecially to one in my state of nerves theseghastly greatcoats these guttural breathing andthe creaking footsteps of this mysterious beinghis steps grew fainter and fainter and at lengthdied away i could bear it no longer i waswound up to the desperation of a hero of romance be he who or what he may said ito myself i'll have a sight of him i seizeda chamber candle and hurried up to no the door stood ajar i hesitated i entered theroom was deserted there stood a large broadbottomed elbow chair at a table on which wasan empty tumbler and a times newspaperand the room smelt powerfully of stiltoncheesethe mysterious stranger had evidently butjust retired i turned off to my room sorely disthestout gentleman appointed as i went along the corridor i sawa large pair of boots with dirty waxed topsstanding at the door of a bed chamber theydoubtless belonged to the unknown but it wouldnot do to disturb so redoubtable a personage inhis den he might discharge a pistol or somethingworse at my head i went to bed thereforeand lay awake half the night in a terriblynervous state and even when i fell asleep i wasstill haunted in my dreams by the idea of thestout gentleman and his waxtopped bootsi slept rather late the next morning and wasawakened by some stir and bustle in the housewhich i could not at first comprehend untilgetting more awake i found there was a mailcoach starting from the door suddenly therewas a cry from below the gentleman has forgot his umbrellalook for the gentleman's umbrella in no i heard an immediate scampering of a chambermaidalong the passage and a shrill replyas she ran here it is here's the gentleman'sumbrella the stout gentlemanthe mysterious stranger then was on thepoint of setting off this was the only chancei should ever have of knowing him i sprangout of bed scrambled to the window snatchedaside the curtains and just caught a glimpse ofthe rear of a person getting in at the coach doorthe skirts of a brown coat parted behind andgave me a full view of the broad disk of a pairof drab breeches the door closed all rightwas the word the coach whirled off and thatwas all i ever saw of the stout gentleman forest treesa living gallery of aged treesone of the favourite themes of boasting withthe squire is the noble trees on his estate whichin truth has some of the finest that i have seenin englandthere is something august and solemn in thegreat avenues of stately oaks that gather theirbranches together high in the air and seem to reducethe pedestrians between them to mere pigmiesan avenue of oaks or elms the squire observes is the true colonnade that should leadto a gentleman's house as to stone and marbleany one can rear them at once they are thework of the day but commend me to the covoli forest treescolonnades that have grown old and great with thefamily and tell by their grandeur how long thefamily has enduredthe squire has great reverence for certainvenerable trees gray with moss which he considersas the ancient nobility of his domainthere is the ruin of an enormous oak whichhas been so much battered by time and tempestthat scarce any thing is left though he sayschristy recollects when in his boyhood it washealthy and flourishing until it was struck bylightning it is now a mere trunk with onetwisted bough stretching up into the air bearinga green branch at the end of it this sturdywreck is much valued by the squire he callsit his standard bearer and compares it to a veteranwarrior beaten down in the battle but bearingup his banner to the last he has actuallyhad a fence built round it to protect it as muchas possible from farther injuryit is with great difficulty that the squire canbe brought to have any tree cut down on his estateto some he looks with reverence as havforesttrees ing been planted by his ancestors to others witha kind of paternal affection as having beenplanted by himself and he feels a degree of awein bringing down with a few strokes of the axewhat it has cost centuries to build up i confessi cannot but sympathize in some degreewith the good squire on the subjectthough brought up in a country overrun withforests where trees are apt to be consideredmere incumbrances and to be laid low withouthesitation or remorse yet i could never see a finetree hewn down without concern the poetswho are naturally lovers of trees as they are ofevery thing that is beautiful have artfully awakenedgreat interest in their favour by representingthem as the habitations of sylvan deities insomuch that every great tree had its tutelargenius or a nymph whose existence was limitedto its duration evelyn in his sylva makes severalpleasing and fanciful allusions to this superstition as the fall says he of a veryaged oak giving a crack like thunder has oftenbeen heard at many miles distance constrained forest treesas i often am to fell them with reluctancy i donot at any time remember to have heard thegroans of those nymphs grieving to be dispossessedof their ancient habitations without someemotion and pity and again in alluding to aviolent storm that had devastated the woodlandshe says methinks i still hear sure i am that istill feel the dismal groans of our forests thelate dreadful hurricane having subverted so manythousands of goodly oaks prostrating the treeslaying them in ghastly postures like whole regimentsfallen in battle by the sword of the conquerorand crushing

america to contemplate the traces ofsome blast of wind which seemed to have rusheddown from the clouds and ripped its waythrough the bosom of the woodlands rootingup shivering and splintering the stoutest treesand leaving a long track of desolationforest trees there was something awful in the vast havocmade among these gigantic plants and in consideringtheir magnificent remains so rudelytorn and mangled and hurled down to perishprematurely on their native soil i was consciousof a strong movement of the sympathy so feelinglyexpressed by evelyn i recollect alsohearing a traveller of poetical temperament expressingthe kind of horror which he felt on beholdingon the banks of the missouri an oak ofprodigious size which had been in a manneroverpowered by an enormous wild grape vinethe vine had clasped its huge folds round thetrunk and from thence had wound about everybranch and twig until the mighty tree hadwithered in its embrace it seemed like laocoonstruggling ineffectually in the hideous coilsof the monster python it was the lion of treesperishing in the embraces of a vegetable boai am fond of listening to the conversation ofenglish gentlemen on rural concerns and of noticingwith what taste and discrimination andwhat strong unaffected interest they will forest treescuss topics which in other countries are abandonedto mere woodmen or rustic cultivators ihave heard a noble earl descant on park and forestscenery with the science and feeling of apainter he dwelt on the shape and beauty ofparticular trees on his estate with as much prideand technical precision as though he had beendiscussing the merits of statues in his collectioni found that he had even gone considerabledistances to examine trees which were celebratedamong rural amateurs for it seems thattrees like houses have their established pointsof excellence and that there are some in englandwhich enjoy very extensive celebrity frombeing perfect in their kindthere is something nobly simple and pure insuch a taste it argues think a sweet andgenerous nature to have this strong relish forthe beauties of vegetation and this friendshipfor the hardy and glorious sons of the forestthere is a grandeur of thought connected withthis part of rural economy it is if may beallowed the figure the heroic line of husbandryforest trees it is worthy of liberal and free born and aspiringmen he who plants an oak looks forwardto future ages and plants for posteritynothing can be less selfish than this he cannotexpect to sit in its shade nor enjoy its shelterbut he exults in the idea that the acornwhich he has buried in the earth shall grow upinto a lofty pile and shall keep on flourishingand increasing and benefiting mankind long afterhe shall have ceased to tread his paternalfieldsindeed it is the nature of such occupationsto lift the thought above mere worldliness asthe leaves of trees are said to absorb all noxiousqualities of the air and to breathe forth a pureratmosphere so it seems to me as if they drewfrom us all sordid and angry passions andbreathed forth peace and philanthropy thereis a serene and settled majesty in woodlandscenery that enters into the soul and dilatesand elevates it and fills it with noble inclinationsthe ancient and hereditary groves toothat embower this island are most of them full forest treesof story they are haunted by the recollectionsof great spirits of past ages who havesought for relaxation among them from thetumult of arms or the toils of state or havewooed the muse beneath their shadewho can walk with soul unmoved among thestately groves of penshurst where the gallantthe amiable the elegant sir philip sidney passedhis boyhood or can look without fondnessupon the tree that is said to have been plantedon his birth day or can ramble among theclassic bowers of harley treading in the footstepsof a pope and a littleton or can pauseamong the solitudes of windsor forest and lookat the oaks around huge gray and timewornlike the old castle towers and not feel as if hewere surrounded by so many monuments of longenduring glory it is when viewed in thislight that planted groves and stately avenuesand cultivated parks have an advantage overthe more luxuriant beauties of unassisted natureit is that they teem with moral associations andkeep up the ever interesting story of humanexistenceforest trees it is becoming then for the high and generousspirits of an ancient nation to cherish thesesacred groves that surround their ancestral mansionsand to perpetuate them to their descendantsbrought up as i have been in republicanhabits and principles i can feel nothing ofthe servile reverence for titled rank merely becauseit is titled but i trust i am neitherchurl nor bigot in my creed i do see and feelhow hereditary distinction when it falls to thelot of a generous mind may elevate that mindinto true nobility it is one of the effects ofhereditary rank when it falls thus happily thatit multiplies the duties and as it were extendsthe existence of the possessor he does notfeel himself a mere individual link in creationresponsible only for his own brief term of beinghe carries back his existence in

pride with which i have noticed englishgentlemen of generous temperaments but higharistocratic feelings contemplating those magnificenttrees which rise like towers and pyramidsfrom the midst of their

early age he took his lads outof their mother's hands w ho was disposed asmothers are apt to be to make fine orderly childrenof them that should keep out of sun andrain and never soil their hands nor tear theirclothes in place of this the squire turned themloose to run free and wild about the park withoutheeding wind or weather he was alsoparticularly attentive in making them bold andexpert

gentlemen forin old times he says according to the welsh saying you might know a gentleman by his hawkhorse and greyhound indeed a cavalier wasseldom seen abroad without his hawk on his fistand even a

writer quite sufficient for anobleman to wind their horn and to carry theirhawke fair and leave study and learning to thechildren of mean peoplein pursuance of this notion the squire andhis faithful coadjutor master simon have bestowedunwearied pains in endeavouring to reclaimas it is termed and to train up hawks forthe sport a bounty has been given for all hawksthat could be brought to them alive and the hallhas been well stocked with vermin of the kindthey have studied the book of st albans andmarkham and various other books that havetreated of falconry but they have more

were in motion thehorses were led up and down before the door there was a direful yelping of dogs some thatwere to accompany us eager to set out and others hawkingthat were to stay at home being whipped backto their kennels at length there was a generalturning out of the chivalry the fair julia wasdressed in a picturesque hunting dress with alight plume of feathers in her riding hat asshe mounted her favourite galloway i remarkedwith pleasure that old christy unbent from hisusual crustiness and hastened to adjust her saddleand bridle he touched his jockey cap as shesmiled on him and thanked him and then lookinground at the other attendants gave a knowingmotion with his head in which i read prideand exultation at the charming appearance ofhis pupillady lillycraft had likewise determined towitness the sport she was dressed in herbroad white beaver tied under the chin and ariding habit of the last century she rode hersleek ambling pony whose motion was as easyas a rocking

this was a learned amusement inwhich he took great interest and indeed hadgiven much counsel from his knowledge of oldcustoms at length every thing was arrangedand off we set from the hallthe exercise

nosportsman i kept with this last party or ratherlagged behind that i might take in the wholepicture and the parson occasionally slackenedhis pace and jogged on in company with methe sport led us at some distance from thehall in a soft meadow reeking with the moistverdure of spring a little river ran through itbordered by willows which had put forth theirtender early foliage the sportsmen were inquestof herons which were said to keep aboutthis streami saw that there was some disputing alreadyamong the leaders of the sport the squiremaster simon and old christy came every nowand then to a pause to consult together like thefield officers of an army and i saw by certainhawking motions of the head that christy was as positiveas any old wrong headed german commanderas we were prancing up this quiet meadowevery sound we made was answered by a distinctecho from the sunny wall of an old buildingthat lay on the opposite margin of the streamthe circumstance brought to my mind and icould not help quoting aloud the description ofan echo on webster's duchess of malay yond side o th river lies a wallpiece of cloister which in my opiniongives the best echo that you ever heardso plain is the distinction of our wordsthat many have supposed it is a spiritthat answersupon hearing this quotation the parson mentioneda beautiful appellation which the jewshad of old for the echo which they

previous disputing and present surpriseslipped off the hood of the hawk and let herfly immediately there was a bawling andshouting and yelping and barking that bafflesall descriptionthe crows flew screaming in all directions while the hawk soared into the air my attentionhowever was attracted for a time to theparty in the meadow riding along in the directionthat the bird flew their bright

graceful figure of thefair julia her eye beaming as blue as the skyshe was contemplating her gallant lover rodeclose by her side and lady liilycraft whowatched them more than the hawk would everyhawking now and then exclaim oh the charming couplei had paused on a rising ground close by herladyship from whence i had a good view of thesport the hawk had singled out a quarry fromamong the carrion crew it was in vain oldchristy called and whistled and endeavouredto lure her down she paid no regard to him andindeed his calls were drowned in the shouts andyelps of the army of militia that he had broughtinto the fieldit was curious to see the efforts of the twobirds to get above each other one to make thefatal swoop the other to avoid it now theycrossed athwart a bright feathery cloud and nowthey were against the clear blue sky i confessbeing no sportsman i was more interested forthe poor bird that was striving for its life thanfor the hawk that was playing the part of a mercenarysoldier at length the hawk got the upperhand and made a rushing stoop at her quarrybut the latter made as sudden a surge downwardsand slanting up again evaded the blow hawkingscreaming and making the best of his way for adry tree on the brow of a neighbouring hillthe poor crow however began to flag thefalcon was again getting above him i felt moreand more interested when an exclamation fromlady liliycraft made me turn my headi beheld a complete confusion among thesportsmen in the little vale below us theywere gal lopping and running towards the edge ofa bank and i was shocked to see

tabletook a curious turn on the subject of a superstitionformerly very prevalent in this part of thecountry relative to the present night of the yearwhich is the eve of st mark's it was believedthe parson informed us that if any one wouldwatch in the church porch on this eve for threesuccessive years from eleven till one o'clock atnight he would see on the third year the shadesof those of the parish who were to die in thest mark's eve course of the year pass by him into the churchclad in their usual appareldismal as such a sight would be he assuredus it was formerly a frequent thing for personsto make the necessary vigils he had knownmore than one instance in his time one oldwoman who pretended to have seen this phantomprocession was an object of great awefor the whole year afterwards and caused muchuneasiness and mischief if she shook her headmysteriously at a person it was like a death warrantand she had nearly caused the death of asick person by looking ruefully in at the windowthere was also an old man not many yearssince of a sullen melancholy temperament whohad kept two vigils and began to excite sometalk in the village when fortunately for publiccomfort he died shortly after his third watching no doubt from a cold which he had taken as thenight was tempestuous it was reported aboutthe village however that he had seen his ownphantom pass by him into the church st mark t s evethis led to the mention of another superstitionof an equally strange and melancholy kindwhich however is chiefly confined to walesit is respecting what are called corpse candleslittle wandering fires of a pale bluish light thatmove about like tapers in the open air and aresupposed to designate the way some corpse is togo one was seen at lanylar late at nighthovering

to and fro along the bank just wherethe candle had moved waiting for the subsidingof the water she at length endeavouredto cross but the poor girl w r as drowned in theattemptaubrey's missal vst

absorb the attention of a circle andsober down its gayety however boisterous bydegrees i noticed that every one was leaningforward over the table with their eyes fixedupon the parson and at the mention of corpsecandles which had been seen about the chamberof a young lady who died on the eve ofher wedding day lady lillycraft turned palei have witnessed the introduction of stories ofthe kind into various evening circles they wereoften commenced in jest and listened to withsmiles but i never knew the most gay or themost enlightened of audiences that were not ifthe conversation continued for any length of timecompletely and solemnly interested in it thereis i believe a degree of superstition lurking inevery mind and i doubt if any one can thoroughlyexamine all his secret notions and impulseswithout detecting it hidden perhaps even from st mark's evehimself it seems in fact to be a part of ournature like instinct of animals acting independentlyof our reason it is often found existingin lofty natures especially those that are poeticaland aspiring a great and extraordinary poetof our day whose life and writings evince a mindsubject to powerful exaltation is said to

to fall in the rear withthe oxonian on our way home when he laughedheartily at my questions and gave me ample informationon the subjectthe truth of the matter is that master simonhas met with a sad rebuff since my christfortunetellingmas visit to the hall he used at that time tobe joked about a widow a fine dashing womanas he privately informed me i had supposed thepleasure he betrayed on these occasions resultedfrom the usual fondness of old bachelors forbeing teased about getting married and aboutflirting and being fickle and false hearted iam assured however that master simon hadreally

galateaonce upon a time in the ancient city of granadathere sojourned a young student of salamancaof the name of antonio de castro hewas pursuing a course of reading in the libraryof the university and at the same time indulginghis curiosity by examining those remains ofmoorish magnificence for which granada is renownedwhile occupied in his studies he frequentlynoticed an old man of singular appearancewho was likewise a visiter at the library the student of salamancahe was lean and withered apparently more fromstudy than age his eyes though bright andvisionary were sunk in his head and thrown intoshade by overhanging eyebrows his dress wasalways the same a black doublet a shortblack cloak very rusty and threadbare redstockings a small ruff and a large overshadowinghathis appetite for knowledge seemed insatiablehe would pass whole days in the library absorbedin study consulting a multiplicity of authors as though he were pursuing some interestingsubject through all its ramifications sothat in general when evening came he wasalmost buried among books and manuscriptsthe curiosity of antonio was excited and heiinquired of the attendants concerning the strangerno one could give him any informationexcepting that he had been for some time past acasual frequenter of the library that his readinglay chiefly among works treating of the occultsciences and that he was particularly curiousin his inquiries after arabian manuscripts theyadded that he never held communication withothe student of salamanca any one excepting to ask for particular works that after a fit of studious application he woulddisappear for several days and even weeks andwhen he revisited the library he would look morewithered and haggard than everthe student felt interested by this account he was leading rather a desultory life and hadall that capricious curiosity which springs up inidleness he determined to make himself acquaintedwith this bookworm and find out whoand what he wasthe next time that he saw the old man at thelibrary he commenced his approaches by requestingpermission to peruse one of the volumes withwhich the unknown appeared to have finishedthe latter merely bowed his head in token ofassent after pretending to look through thevolume with great attention he returned it withmany acknowledgments the stranger madeno replymay i ask senor said antonio with somehesitation may i ask what you are searchingafter in all these books the student of salamancathe old man raised his head with an expressionof surprise at having his studies interruptedfor the first time arid by so intrusive a questionhe surveyed the student with a side glance fromhead to foot wisdom my son said he calmly and the search requires every moment ofmy attention he then cast his eyes upon hisbook and resumed his studies but fathersaid antonio cannot you spare a moment topoint out the road to others it is to experiencedtravellers like you that we strangers in the pathsof knowledge must look for directions on ourjourneythe stranger looked disturbed i have nottime enough my son to learn said he muchless to teach i am ignorant myself of the pathof true knowledge how then can i show it toothers well but father senor said the old man mildly but earnestlyyou must see that i have but few stepsmore to the grave in that short space have ito accomplish the whole business of my existencethe student of salamanca i have no time for words every word is as onegrain of sand of my glass wasted suffer me tobe alonethere was no replying to so complete a closingof the door of intimacy the student foundhimself calmly but totally repulsed thoughcurious and inquisitive yet he was naturallymodest and on after thoughts he blushed at hisown intrusion his mind soon became occupiedby other objects he passed several days wanderingamong the mouldering piles of moorisharchitecture those melancholy monuments of anelegant and voluptuous people he paced thedeserted halls of the alhambra the paradise ofthe moorish kings he visited the great courtof the lions famous for the perfidious massacreof the gallant abencerrages he gazed withadmiration at its mosaic cupolas gorgeouslypainted in gold and azure its basins of marble its alabaster vase supported by lions and storiedwith inscriptionshis imagination kindled as he wanderedamong these scenes they were calculated toawaken all the enthusiasm of a youthful mind the student of salamancamost of the halls have anciently been beautifiedby fountains the fine taste of the arabs delightedin the sparkling purity and revivingfreshness of water and they erected as it werealtars on every side to that delicate elementpoetry mingles with architecture in the al alhambrait breathes along the very walls whereeverantonio turned his eye he beheld inscriptionsin arabic wherein the perpetuity of moorishpower and splendour within these walls wasconfidently predicted alas how had the prophecybeen falsified many of the basins wherethe fountains had once thrown up their sparklingshowers were dry and dusty some of thepalaces were turned into gloomy convents andthe barefoot monk paced through those courtswhich had once glittered with the array andechoed to the music of moorish chivalryin the course of his rambles the student morethan once encountered the old man of the libraryhe was always alone and so full ofthought as not to notice any one about himhe appeared to be intent upon studying thosethe student of salamanca half buried inscriptions which are found hereand there among the moorish ruins and seemto murmur from the earth the tale of formergreatness the greater part of these have sincebeen translated but they were supposed bymany at the time to contain symbolical revelationsand golden maxims of the arabian sagesand astrologersas antonio saw the stranger apparently decypeering these inscriptions he felt an eager longingto make his acquaintance and to participatein his curious researches but the repulse he hadmet with at the library deterred him from makingany farther advanceshe had directed his steps one evening to thesacred mount which overlooks the beautiful valleywatered by the darro the fertile plain of thevega and all that rich diversity of vale andmountain that surrounds granada with an earthlyparadise it was twilight when he found himselfat the place where at the present day aresituated the chapels known by the name of thesacred furnaces they are so called fromvol i the student of salamancagrottoes in which some of the primitive saintsare said to have been burnt at the time of antonio'svisit the place was an object of muchcuriosity in an excavation of these grottoesseveral manuscripts had recently been discoveredengraved on plates of lead they were writtenin the arabian language excepting one whichwas in unknown characters the pope hadissued a bull forbidding any one under pain ofexcommunication to speak of these manuscriptsthe prohibition had only excited the greatercuriosity and many reports were whisperedabout that these manuscripts contained treasuresof dark and forbidden knowledgeas antonio was examining the place fromwhence these mysterious manuscripts had beendrawn he again observed the old man of thelibrary wandering among the ruins his curiositywas now fully awakened the time andplace served to stimulate it he resolved to watchthis unknown groper after secret and forgottenlore and to trace him to his habitation therewas something like adventure in the thing thatthe student of salamanca charmed his romantic disposition he followedthe stranger therefore at a little distance atfirst cautiously but he soon observed him to beso wrapped in his own thoughts as to take littleheed of external objects they passed alongthe skirts of the mountain and then by the shadybanks of the darro they pursued their wayfor some distance from granada along a lonelyroad that led among the hills the gloom ofevening was gathering and it was quite darkwhen the stranger stopped at the portal of a solitarymansionit appeared to be a mere wing or ruined fragmentof what had once been a pile of some consequencethe walls were of great thicknessthe windows narrow and generally secured byiron bars the door was of planks studdedwith iron spikes and had been of great strengththough at present it was much decayed atoneend of the mansion was a ruinous tower inthe moorish style of architecture the edificehad probably been a country retreat or castle ofpleasure during the occupation of granada by the student of salamancathe moors and rendered sufficiently strong towithstand any casual assault in those warliketimesthe old man knocked at the portal a light appearedat a small window just above it and afemale head looked out it might have servedas a model for one of raphael's saints thehair was beautifully braided and gathered in asilken net and the complexion as well as couldbe judged from the light was that soft rich brunetteso becoming in southern beautyit is i my child said the old man theface instantly disappeared and soon after awicket door in the large portal opened antoniowho had ventured near to the building caught atransient sight of a delicate female form a pairof fine black eyes darted a look of surprise atseeing a stranger hovering near and the doorwas precipitately closedthere was something in this sudden gleam ofbeauty that wonderfully struck the imaginationof the student it was like a brilliant flashingfrom its dark casket he sauntered about retee student of salamanca harding the gloomy pile with increasing interesta few simple wild notes from among some rocksand trees at a little distance attracted his attentionhe found there a group of giants avagabond gipsy race that at that time aboundedin spain and lived in hovels and caves of thehills about the neighbourhood of granada somewere busy about a fire others were listening tothe uncouth music which one of their companionsseated on a ledge of the rock was makingwith a split reedantonio endeavoured to obtain some informationof them concerning the old building and itsinhabitantsthe one who appeared to be their spokesmanwas a gaunt fellow with a subtle gait a whisperingvoice and a sinister roll of the eye heshrugged his shoulders on the student's inquiriesand said that all was not right in that buildingan old man inhabited it whom nobody knewand whose family appeared to be only his daughterand a female servant he and his companionshe added lived up among the neighbouring the student of salamancahills and as they had been about at night theyhad often seen strange lights and heard strangesounds from the tower some of the countrypeople who worked in the vineyards among thehills believed the old man to be one that dealt inthe black art and were not over fond of passingnear the tower at night but for our partssaid the gitano we are not a people that troubleourselves much with fears of that kindthe student endeavoured to gain more preciseinformation but they had none to furnishhim they began to be solicitous for a compensationfor what they had already imparted andrecollecting the loneliness of the place and thevagabond character of his companions he wasglad to give them a gratuity and to hasten homewardshe sat down to his studies but his brain wastoo full of what he had seen and heard his eyewas upon the page but his fancy still returned tothe tower and he was continually picturing thelittle window with the beautiful head peepingout or the door half open and the nymphlikeform withinthe student of salamanca he retired to bed but the same objectshaunted his dreams he was young and susceptible and the excited state of his feelings fromwandering among the abodes of departed graceand gallantry had predisposed him for a suddenimpression from female beautythe next morning he strolled again in the directionof the tower it was still more forlornby the broad glare of day than in the gloom ofevening the walls were crumbling and weedsand moss were growing in every crevice ithad the look of a prison rather than a dwellinghouse in one angle however he remarked awindow which seemed an exception to the surroundingsqualidness there w z as a curtaindrawn within it and flowers standing on thewindow stone whilst he was looking at it thecurtain was partially withdrawn and a delicatewhite arm of the most beautiful roundness wasput forth to water the flowersthe student made a noise to attract the attentionof the fair florist he succeeded thecurtain was farther drawn and he had a glance the student of salamancaof the same face he had seen the evening before it was but a mere glance the curtainagain fell and the casement closed all thiswas calculated to excite the feelings of a romanticyouth had he seen the unknown underother circumstances it is probable that he wouldnot have been struck with her beauty but thisappearance of being shut up and kept apartgave her the value of a treasured gem he passedand repassed before the house several timesin the course of the day but saw nothing morehe was there again in the evening the wholeaspect of the house was dreary the narrowwindows emitted no rays of cheerful light to indicatethat there was social life within antoniolistened at the portal but no sound of voicesreached his ear just then he heard the clappingto of a distant door and fearing to be detectedin the unworthy act of eavesdroppinghe precipitately drew off to the opposite side ofthe road and stood in the shadow of a ruinedarchwayhe now remarked a light from a window inthe student of salamanca the tower it was fitful and changeable commonlyfeeble and yellowish as if from a lampwith an occasional glare of some vivid metalliccolour followed by a dusky glow a columnof dense smoke would now and then rise in theair and hang like a canopy over the towerthere was altogether such a loneliness andseeming mystery about the building and its inhabitantsthat antonio was half inclined to indulgethe country people's notions and to fancy it theden of some powerful sorcerer and the fair damselhe had seen some spellbound beautyafter some time had elapsed a light appearedin the window where he had seen the beautifularm the curtain was down but it was sothin that he could perceive the shadow of someonepassing and repassing between it and thelight he fancied that he could distinguishthat the form was delicate and from the alacrityof its movements it was evidently youthfulhe had not a doubt but this was the bed chamberof his beautiful unknownpresently he heard the sound of a guitar andvol i the student of salamancaa female voice singing he drew near cautiouslyand listened it was a plaintive moorishballad and he recognized in it the lamentationsof one of the abencerrages on leaving thewalls of lovely granada it was full of passionad tenderness it spoke of the delightsof early life the hours of love it had enjoyedon the banks of the darro and among theblissful abodes of the alhambra it bewailedthe fallen honours of the abencerrages and imprecatedvengeance on their oppressors antoniowas affected by the music it singularlycoincided with the place it was like the voiceof past times echoed in the present and breathingamong the monuments of its departed gloriesthe voice ceased after a time the light disappearedand all was still she sleeps

the casement thethe student of salamanca late gloomy landscape gradually became floodedwith its radiance finding therefore that hecould no longer move about in obscurity andfearful that his loitering might be observed hereluctantly retiredthe curiosity which had at first drawn theyoung man to the tower was now seconded byfeelings of a more romantic kind his studieswere almost entirely abandoned he maintaineda kind of blockade of the old mansion hewould take a book with him and pass a greatpart of the day under the trees in its vicinity keeping a vigilant eye upon it and endeavouringto ascertain what were the walks of his mysteriouscharmer he found however that shenever went out except to mass when she wasaccompanied by her father he waited at thedoor of the church and offered her the holywater in the hopes of touching her hand a littleoffice of gallantry common in catholic countriesshe however modestly declined without raisingher eyes to see who made the offer and alwaystook it herself from the font she was attentive the student of salamancain her devotion her eyes were never taken fromthe altar or the priest and on returning homeher countenance was almost entirely concealedby her mantillaantonio had now carried on the pursuit forseveral days and was hourly getting more andmore interested in the pursuit but never a stepnearer to the game his lurking about thehouse had probably been noticed for he no longersaw the fair face at the window nor the whitearm put forth to water the flowershis only consolation was to repair nightly tohis post of observation listen to her warblingand if by chance he could catch a sight of hershadow passing and repassing before the windowhe thought himself most fortunateas he was indulging in one of these eveningvigils which were complete revels of the imaginationthe sound of approaching footsteps madehim withdraw into the deep shadow of the ruinedarchway opposite to the tower a cavalierapproached wrapped in a large spanish cloakhe paused under the window of the towerthe student op salamanca after a little while began a serenade accompaniedby his guitar in the usual style of spanishgallantry his voice was rich and manly hetouched the instrument with skill and sangwith amorous and impassioned eloquencethe plume of his hat was buckled by jewelsthat sparkled in the moon beams and as heplayed on the guitar his cloak falling off fromone shoulder showed him to be richly dressedit was evident that he was a person of rankthe idea now flashed across antonio's mindthat the affections of his unknown beauty mightbe engaged she was young and doubtless susceptibleand it was not in the nature of spanishfemales to be deaf and insensible to music andadmiration the surmise brought with it afeeling of dreariness there vas a pleasantdream of several days suddenly dispelled hehad never before experienced any thing of thetender passion and as its morning dreams arealways delightful he would fain have continuedin the delusionu but what have i to do with her attachedthe student of salamancaments thought he i have no claim on herheart nor even on her acquaintance how doi know that she is worthy of affection or ifshe

study will soonchase away all these idle fanciesthe more he thought however the more hebecame entangled in the spell which his livelyimagination had woven round him and nowthat a rival had appeared in addition to theother obstacles that environed this enchantedbeauty she appeared ten times more lovely anddesirable it was some slight consolation tohim to perceive that the gallantry of the unknownmet with no apparent return from thetower the light at the window was extinguished the curtain remained undrawn andnone of the customary signals were given tointimate that the serenade was acceptedthe cavalier lingered for some time about thethe student of salamanca place and sang several other tender airs with ataste and feeling that made antonio's heartacheat length he slowly retired the studentremained with folded arms leaning against theruined arch endeavouring to summon up resolutionenough to depart but there was a romanticfascination that still enchained him to theplace it is the last time said he willing tocompromise between his feelings and his judgment it is the last time then let me enjoythe dream a few moments longeras his eye ranged about the old building totake a farewell look he observed the strangelight in the tower which he had noticed on aformer occasion it kept beaming up and decliningas before a pillar of smoke rose in theair and hung in sable volumes it was evidentthe old man was busied in some of those operationsthat had gained him the reputation of asorcerer throughout the neighbourhoodsuddenly an intense and brilliant glare shonethrough the casement followed by a loud reportand then a fierce and ruddy glow a figure the student of salamancafeared at the window uttering cries of agony oralarm but immediately disappeared and a bodyof smoke and flame whirled out of the narrowaperture antonio rushed to the portal andknocked at it with vehemence he was onlyanswered by loud shrieks and found that thefemales were ready in helpless consternationwith an exertion of desperate strength he forcedthe wicket from its hinges and rushed into thehousehe found himself in a small vaulted hall andby the light of the moon which entered at thedoor he saw a stairs to the left he hurried upit to a narrow corridor through which was rulinga volume of smoke he found here thetwo females in a frantic state of alarm one ofthem clasped her hands and implored him to saveher fatherthe corridor terminated in a small spiral staircaseleading up to the tower he sprang up itto a small door through the chinks of whichcame a glow of light and smoke was spurningout he burst it open and found himself in anhe student of salamanca antique vaulted chamber furnished with furnaceand various chemical apparatus a shatteredretort lay on the stone floor a quantity of combustiblesnearly consumed with various halfburnt books and papers were sending up an expiringflame and filling the chamber with stiflingsmoke just within the threshold lay the reputedconjurer he was bleeding his clotheswere scorched and he appeared lifeless antoniocaught him up and bore him down thestairs to a chamber in which there was a lightand laid him on a bedthe female domestic was despatched for suchappliances as the house afforded but the daughterthrew herself frantically beside her parentand could not be reasoned out of her alarm herdress was all in

and raved incoherentlythe student of salamanca about malignant demons and about the habitationof the green lion being destroyed hiswounds being dressed and such other remediesadministered as his situation required he sankinto a state of quiet antonio now turned hisattention to the daughter whose sufferings hadbeen little inferior to those of her father havingwith great difficulty succeeded in tranquillizingher fears he endeavoured to prevail uponher to retire and seek the repose so necessary toher frame proffering to remain by her fatheruntil morning i am a stranger said he it istrue and my offer may appear intrusive buti see you are lonely and helpless and i cannothelp venturing over the limits of mere ceremonyshould you feel any scruple or doubt howeversay but a word and i will instantly retirethere was a frankness a kindness and amodesty mingled in antonio's deportment thatinspired instant confidence and his simple scholar'sgarb was a recommendation in the houseof poverty the females consented to resign thesufferer to his care as they would be the betterable to attend to him on the morrow the student of salamancaon retiring the old domestic was profuse inher benedictions the daughter only looked herthanks but as they shone through the tearsthat filled her fine black eyes the studentthought them a thousand times the most eloquenthere then he was by a singular turn ofchance completely housed within this mysteriousmansion when left to himself and the bustleof the scene was over his heart throbbed as helooked round the chamber in which he was sittingit was the daughter's room the promisedland towards which he had cast so many a longinggaze the furniture was old and had probablybelonged to the building in its prosperousdays but every thing was arranged with proprietythe flowers that he had seen her attend stoodin the window a guitar leaned against a tableon which stood a crucifix and before it lay amissal and a rosary there reigned an air ofpurity and serenity about this little nestling placeof innocence it was the emblem of a chasteand quiet mind some few articles of femalethe student op salamanca dress lay on the chairs and there was the verybed on which she had slept the pillow on whichher soft cheek had reclined the poor scholarwas treading enchanted ground for what fairylandhas more of magic in it than the bed chamberof innocence and beauty from various expressions of the old man inhis ravings and from what he had noticed on asubsequent visit to the tower to see that the firewas extinguished antonio had gathered thathis patient was an alchymist the philosopher'sstone was an object eagerly sought after by visionariesin those days but in consequence ofthe superstitious prejudices of the times and thefrequent persecutions of its votaries they wereapt to pursue their experiments in secret inlonely houses in caverns and ruins or in theprivacy of cloistered cellsin the course of the night the old man hadseveral fits of restlessness and delirium he wouldcall out upon theophrastus and geber andalbertus magnus and other sages of his art and anon would murmur about fermentation the student of salamancaand x projection until towards daylight he oncemore sank into a salutary sleepwhen the morning sun darted his rays intothe casement the fair inez attended by the femaledomestic came blushing into the chamberthe student now took his leave having himselfneed of repose but obtained ready permission toreturn and inquire after the sufferer when hecalled again he found the alchymist languidand in pain but apparently suffering more inmind than in body his delirium had left himand he had been informed of the particulars ofhis deliverance and of the subsequent attentionsof the scholar he could

mysterioushabitationthe alchymist was so helpless as to needmuch assistance antonio remained with himtherefore the greater part of the day he repeatedhis visit the next day and the nextthe student of salamanca every day his company seemed more pleasingto the invalid and every day he felt his interestin the latter increasing perhaps the presenceof the daughter might have been at thebottom of this solicitudehe had frequent and long conversations withthe alchymist he found him as men of hispursuits were apt to be a mixture of enthusiasmand simplicity of curious and extensivereading on points of little utility with greatinattention to the every day occurrences of lifeand profound ignorance of the world he wasdeeply versed in singular and obscure branchesof knowledge and much given to visionaryspeculations antonio whose mind was of aromantic cast had himself given some attentionto the occult sciences and entered uponthose themes with an ardour that delighted thephilosopher their conversations frequentlyturned upon astrology divination and the greatsecret the old man would forget his achesand wounds rise up like a spectre in his bedand kindle into eloquence on his favourite

engaged in the pursuit with thehopes of raising himself from his present obscurityand resuming the rank arid dignity to whichhis birth entitled him but as usual it ended inabsorbing every thought and

thatonce inspired me is gone my poor frame is exhaustedby study and watchfulness and this lastmisfortune has hurried me towards the gravethe student of salamanca he concluded in a tone of deep dejectionantonio endeavoured to comfort and reassurehim but the poor alchymist had for onceawakened to a consciousness of the worldly illsthat were gathering around him and had sunkinto despondency after a pause and somethoughtfulness and perplexity of brow antonioventured to make a proposali have long said he been filled with alove for the secret sciences but have felt too ignorantand diffident

should fail why must depend like other scholars upon my brainsto carry me through the worldthe philosopher's spirits were howevermore depressed than the student had imaginedthis last shock following in the rear of somany disappointments had almost destroyedthe reaction of his mind the fire of an enthusiasthowever is never so low but that it maybeblown again into a flame by degrees theold man was cheered and reanimated by thebuoyancy and ardour of his sanguine companionhe at length agreed to accept of the services ofthe student and once more to renew his experimentshe objected however to using thestudent's gold notwithstanding that his ownwas nearly exhausted but this objection wassoon overcome the student insisted on makingit a common stock and common cause andthen how absurd was any delicacy about sucha trifle with men who looked forward to discoveringthe philosopher's stonewhile therefore the alchymist was slowlythe student of salamanca recovering the student busied himself in gettingthe laboratory once more in order it wasstrewed with the wrecks of retorts and alembics with old crucibles boxes and phials ofpowders and tinctures and half burnt booksand manuscriptsas soon as the old man was sufficiently recoveredthe studies and experiments were renewedthe student became a privileged andfrequent visiter and was indefatigable in histoils in the laboratory the philosopher dailyderived new zeal and spirits from the animationof his disciple he was now enabled to prosecutethe enterprise with continued exertionhaving so active a coadjutor to divide the toilwhile he was poring over the writings of sandsand philalethes and dominus de nuysment and endeavouring to comprehend the symbolicallanguage in which they have locked uptheir inscrutable mysteries antonio would occupyhimself among the retorts and cruciblesand keep the furnace in a perpetual glowwith all his zeal however for the discoveryvol i the student of salamancaof the golden art the feelings of the student hadnot cooled as to the object that first drew himto this ruinous mansion during the old man'sillness he had frequent opportunities of beingnear the daughter and every day made himmore sensible to her charms there was a puresimplicity and an almost passive gentleness inher manners yet with all this was mingled somethingwhether mere maiden shyness or a consciousnessof high descent or a dash of castilianpride or perhaps all united which preventedundue familiarity and made her difficult of approachthe danger of her father and the measures tobe taken for his relief had at first overcome thiscoyness and reserve but as he recovered and heralarm subsided she seemed to shrink from thefamiliarity she had indulged with the youthfulstranger and to become every day more shyand silentantonio had read many books but this wasthe first volume of woman kind that he hadever studied he had been captivated with thethe student of salamanca very title page but the farther he read themore he was delighted she seemed formed tolove her soft black eye rolled languidly underits long silken lashes and wherever it turned itwould linger and repose there was tendernessin every beam to him alone she was reservedand distant now that the common cares ofthe sick room were at an end he saw littlemore of her than before his admission to thehouse sometimes he met her on his way toand from the laboratory and at such times therewas ever a smile and a blush but after a simplesalutation she glided on and disappearedtis plain thought antonio my presenceis indifferent if not irksome to her shehas noticed my admiration and is determined todiscourage it nothing but a feeling of gratitudeprevents her treating me with marked distaste and then has she not another lover richgallant splendid

amorous serenadercontinually haunted his mind he felt convincedthat he was a favoured lover yet if sowhy did he not frequent the tower why didhe not make his approaches by noonday there was mystery in this eavesdropping andmusical courtship surely inez could not beencouraging a secret intrigue oh no she wastoo artless too pure too ingenuous but thenthe spanish females were so prone to love

starving man willgive him a new lease of existence and a faintsmile or a kind look bestowed at casual intervalswill keep a lover loving on when a man inhis sober senses would despairthe student of salamanca when antonio found himself alone in the laboratoryhis mind would be haunted by one ofthese looks or smiles which he had received inpassing he would set it in every possible lightand argue on it with all the selfpleasing selfteasinglogic of a loverthe country around him was enough toawaken that voluptuousness of feeling so favourableto the growth of passion the windowof the tower rose above the trees of the romanticvalley of the darro and looked downupon some of the loveliest scenery of the vega where the groves of citrons and orange were refreshedby cool springs and brooks of the purestwater the xenel and the darro wound theirshining streams along the plain and gleamedfrom among its bowers the surrounding hillswere covered with vineyards and the mountainscrowned with snow seemed to melt into the bluesky the delicate airs that played about thetower were perfumed by the fragrance of myrtleand orange blossoms and the ear was charmedwith the fond warbling of the nightingale which the student of salamancain these happy regions sings the whole daylong sometimes too there was the idle songof the muleteer sauntering along the solitaryroad or the notes of the guitar from somegroup of peasants dancing in the shade allthese were enough to fill the head of a younglover with poetic fancies and antonio wouldpicture to himself how he could live among thosehappy groves and wander by those gentle riversand love away his life with inezhe felt at times impatient at his own weaknessand would endeavour to brush away thesecobwebs of the mind he would turn histhoughts with sudden effort to his occult studies or occupy himself in some perplexing process but often when he had partially succeededin fixing his attention the sound of inez luteor the soft notes of her voice would come stealingupon the stillness of the chamber and as itwere floating round the tower there was nogreat art in her performance but antonio thoughthe had never heard music comparable to thisit was perfect witchcraft to hear her warble forththe student of salamanca some of her national melodies those little spanishromances and moorish ballads that transportthe hearer in idea to the banks of theguadalquiver or the walls of alhambra andmake him dream of beauties and balconies andmoonlight serenadesnever was poor student more sadly beset thanantonio love is a troublesome companion inastudy at the best of times but in the laboratoryof an alchymist his intrusion is terribly disastrousinstead of attending to the retorts andcrucibles and watching the process of some experimententrusted to his charge the studentwould get entranced in one of these love dreamsfrom which he would often be aroused by somefatal catastrophe the philosopher on returningfrom his researches in the libraries wouldfind every thing gone wrong and antonio in despairover the ruins of the whole day's workthe old man however took all quietly for hishad been a life of experiments and

silver or gold and that every smilewas worth a ducatsometimes in the cool of the evening whenthe toils of the laboratory happened to be suspendedhe would walk with the alchymist inwhat had once been a garden belonging to themansion there were still the remains of terracesand balustrades and here and there avol i the student of salamancamarble urn or mutilated statue overturned andburied among weeds and flowers run wildit was the favourite resort of the alchymist inhis hours of relaxation where he would give fullscope to his visionary flights his mind wastinctured with the rosycrucian doctrines hebelieved in elementary beings some favourableothers adverse to his pursuits and in the exaltationof his fancy had often imagined that heheld communion with them in his solitary walksabout the whispering groves and echoing wallsof this old garden when accompanied by antoniohe would prolong these evening recreationsindeed he sometimes did it out of considerationfor his disciple for he feared his too close applicationand his incessant seclusion in the towerwould be injurious to his health he was delightedand surprised by this extraordinary zealandperseverance in so young a tyro and lookedupon him as destined to be one of the great luminariesof the art lest the student shouldrepine at the time lost in these relaxations thegood alchymist would fill them up with wholethestudent of

peripatetic the student of salamancaturns with all the ardour of a devotee but therewas another circumstance which may have givena secret charm to them the garden was theresort also of inez where she took her walks ofrecreation the only exercise that her secludedlife permittedas antonio was duteously pacing by the sideof his instructor he would often catch a glimpseof the daughter walking pensively about the alleysin the soft twilight sometimes they wouldmeet her unexpectedly and the heart of thestudent would throb with agitation a blushtoo would crimson the cheek of inez but stillshe passed on and never joined themhe had remained one evening until rather alate hour with the alchymist in this favouriteresort it was a delightful night after a sultryday and the balmy air of the garden was peculiarlyreviving the old man was seated on afragment of a pedestal looking like a part ofthe ruin on which he sat he was edifying hispupil by reading long lessons of wisdom fromthe stars

and shed hergleaming light among the chequered grovesantonio apparently listened with fixed attentionto the sage but his ear was drinking in the melodyof inez voice who was singing to her lutein one of the moonlight glades of the gardenthe old man having exhausted his theme satgazing in silent reverie at the heavens antoniocould not resist an inclination to steal a look atthis coy beauty that was playing the part of thenightingale so sequestered and musical leavingthe alchymist in his celestial reverie he stolegently along one of the alleys the music hadceased and he thought he heard the sound ofvoices he came to an angle of a copse thathad screened a kind of green recess ornamented the student of salamancaby a marble fountain the moon shone fullupon the place and by its light he beheld his unknownserenading rival at the feet of inez hewas detaining her by the hand which he coveredwith kisses but at the sight of antonio he startedup and half drew his sword while inez disengagedfled back to the houseall the jealous doubts and fears of antoniowere now confirmed he did not remain to encounterthe resentment of his happy rival atbeing thus interrupted but turned from the placewith sudden wretchedness of heart that inezshould love another would have been miseryenough but that she should be capable of adishonourable amour shocked him in the extremethe idea of deception in so young

lovermakes when he finds his mistress not quitesuch a goddess as he had painted her with the student of salamancathe student however it sprang from honestanguish of heart he returned to his lodgingsin pitiable confusion of mind he now deploredthe infatuation that had led him on untilhis feelings were so thoroughly engaged heresolved to abandon his pursuits at the towerand trust to absence to dispel the fascination bywhich he had been spell bound he no longerthirsted after the discovery of the grand elixir the dream of alchymy was over for withoutinez what was the value of the philosopher'sstone he rose after a sleepless night with the determinationof taking his leave of the alchymistand tearing himself from granada forseveral days did he rise with the same resolutionand every night saw him come backto his pillow to repine at his want of resolutionand to make fresh determinations for themorrow in the meanwhile he saw less of inezthan ever she no longer walked in the gardenbut remained almost entirely in her apartmentwhen she met him she blushed morethe student of salamanca than usual and once hesitated as if she wouldhave spoken but after a temporary embarrassmentand still deeper blushes she made somecasual observation and retired antonio readin this confusion a consciousness of fault andof that fault's being discovered what couldshe have wished to communicate perhaps toaccount for the scene in the garden but howcan she account for it or why should she accountfor it to me what am i to her orrather what is she to me exclaimed he impatientlywith a new resolution to break throughthese entanglements of the heart and fly fromthis enchanted spot for everhe was returning that very night to his lodgingsfull of these excellent determinationswhen in a shadowy part of the road hepassed a person whom he recognized by hisheight and form for his rival he was goingin the direction of the tower if any lingeringdoubts remained here was an opportunity ofsettling them completely he determined tofollow this unknown cavalier and under favoli the student of salamancayour of the darkness observe his movementsif he obtained access to the tower or in anywaya favourable reception antonio felt as if itwould be a relief to his mind and would enablehim to fix his waveringesolutionthe unknown as he came near the towerwas more cautious and stealthy in his approacheshe was joined under a clump of trees byanother person and they had much whisperingtogether a light was burning in the chamberof inez the curtain was drawn but the casementwas left open as the night was warm aftersome time the light was extinguished a considerableinterval elapsed the cavalier and hiscompanion remained under covert of the treesas if keeping watch at length they approachedthe tower with silent and cautious steps thecavalier received a dark lanthorn from his companionand threw off his cloak the other thensoftly brought something from the clump of treeswhich antonio perceived to be a light ladderhe placed it against the wall and the serenadegently ascended a sickening sensation cameover antonio here was indeed a confirmathestudent of salamanca tion of every fear he was about to leave theplace never to return when he heard a stifledshriek from inez chamberin an instant the fellow that stood at the footof the ladder lay prostrate on the ground antoniowrested a stiletto from his nerveless handand hurried up the ladder he sprang in at thewindow and found inez struggling in the graspof his fancied rival the latter disturbed fromhis prey caught up his lanthorn turned its lightfull upon antonio and drawing his sword madea furious assault luckily the student saw thelight gleam along the blade and parried thethrust with the stiletto a fierce but unequalcombat ensued antonio fought exposed to thefull glare of the light while his antagonist wasin shadow his stiletto too was but a poor defenceagainst a rapier he saw that nothingw r ould save him but closing with his adversaryand getting within his weapon he rushed furiouslyupon him and gave him a severe blow withthe stiletto but received a wound in return fromthe shortened sword at the same moment a the student of salamancablow was inflicted from behind by the confederatewho had ascended the ladder it felledhim to the floor and his antagonists made theirescapeby this time the cries of inez had broughther

bestowedupon him among his varied knowledgehe possessed some skill in surgery which atthis moment was of more value than even hischronical lore he stanched and dressed thewounds of his disciple which on examinationproved less desperate than he had at first apprehendedfor a few days however his case was anxiousand attended with danger the old manwatched over him with the affection of a parenthe felt a double debt of gratitude towardshim on account of his daughter and himselfhe loved him too as a faithful and zealousthe student of salamanca disciple and he dreaded lest the world shouldbe

severer wounds which he carried in hisheart she displayed the strongest interest inhis safety she called him her deliverer herpreserver it seemed as if her grateful dispositionsought in the warmth of its acknowledgmentsto repay him for past coldnessbut what most contributed to antonio's recoverywas her explanation concerning his supposedrival it was some time since he hadfirst beheld her at church and he had ever sincepersecuted her with his attentionshe had beset her in her walks until she hadbeen obliged to confine herself to the house exceptwhen accompanied by her father he hadbesieged her with letters serenades and everyart by which he could urge a vehement butclandestine and dishonourable suit the scene the student of salamancain the garden was as much a surprise to her asto antonio

appearanceof the student interrupted him and enabled herto make her escape she had forborne to mentionto her father the persecution which shesuffered she wished to spare him unavailinganxiety and distress and had determined to confineherself more rigorously to the house thoughit appeared that even here she had not beensafe from his daring enterprizeantonio inquired whether she knew the nameof

in aninstant from the scabbard the student wasarmed and equally alert there was a fierceclash of weapons the crowd made way forthem as they fought and closed again so asto hide them from the view of inez all wasthe student of salamanca tumult and confusion for a moment when therewas a kind of shout from the spectators andthe mob again opening she beheld as shethought antonio weltering in his bloodthis new shock was too great for her alreadyoverstrained intellects a giddiness seizedupon her every thing seemed to whirl beforeher eyes she gasped some incoherent wordsand sunk senseless upon the grounddays weeks elapsed before inez returned toconsciousness at length she opened her eyesas if out of a troubled sleep she was lyingupon a magnificent bed in a chamber richlyfurnished with pier glasses and massive tablesinlaid with silver of exquisite workmanshipthe walls were covered with tapestry the cornicesrichly gilded through the door whichstood open she perceived a superb saloon withstatues and chrystal lustres and a magnificentsuite of apartments beyond the casements ofthe room were open to admit the soft breath ofsummer which stole in laden with perfumesfrom a neighbouring garden from whencethe student of salamancaalso the refreshing sounds of fountains and thesweet notes of birds came in mingled music toher ears female attendants were moving withnoiseless step about the apartment but as shegazed around in silent wonder her eye restedupon a new object of interest in a chair atthe head of her bed sat a venerable formwatching over her with a look of fond anxietyit was her father i will not attempt to describethe scene that ensued nor the momentsof rapture which more than repaid all the sufferingsher affectionate heart had undergone assoon as their feelings had become more calmthe alchymist stepped out of the room to introducea stranger to whom they were indebtedfor their lives and liberties he returned leadingin antonio no longer in his poor scholar'sgarb but in the rich dress of a noblemanthe feelings of inez were nearly overpoweredby the sudden reverses and it was some timebefore she was sufficiently calm to comprehendthe explanation of this seeming romanceit appeared that the lover who had sought herthe student of salamanca affections in the lowly guise of a student wasonly son and heir of a powerful grandee of valentiasome youthful irregularities had drawnon him the displeasure of his father he hadabsented himself from home and remained incognitoat granada with a full resolve by studyand self regulation to reinstate himself in hisfather's favour how hard he had studieddoes not remain on record all that we knowis his romantic adventure of the towerit was at first a mere youthful caprice excitedby a glimpse of a beautiful face in becoming adisciple of the achy mist he probably thought ofnothing more than pursuing a light love adventurefarther acquaintance however completelyfixed his affections in the mean timehe had been traced to his concealment hisfather had relieved intelligence doubtless fromdon ambrosio of his being entangled in thesnares of a mysterious adventurer and his daughtertrusty emissaries had been sent to seizeupon him and convey him by force to the paternalhome the student of salamancawhat eloquence he used with his father toconvince him of the perfect innocence and nobledescent of the alchemist and of the exalted worthof his daughter does not appear all that weknow is that the father though a very passionatewas a very reasonable man as appears byhis consenting that his son should return to granadaand conduct inez as his affianced bride tovalentia on his arrival he had been shockedat finding the tower deserted and reading thealchymist's name on the list of the condemnedat the autodafe he arrived just in time tosave him from the flames it was don ambrosiathat had fallen in their contest beingoseverely wounded and thinking his end approachinghe had confessed to one of the fathersof the inquisition that he was the sole cause ofthe alchymist's condemnation and that the evidenceon which it was founded was altogetherfalse the testimony of don antonio camein corroboration of his innocence and as he wasa relation of the grand inquisitor's it perhaps hadmore than usual weight thus the poor alchythe student of salamanca mist was in a manner snatched from the veryflames and so great had been the sympathy excitedin his case that for once the populacerejoiced in being disappointed of an executionthe residue of this story may readily be imaginedby any one versed in this valuable kind ofhistory don antonio married the lovely inezand took her and her father with him to valenciaas she had been a loving and dutiful daughterso she proved a true and tender wife it wasnot long before he succeeded to his father's titlesand estates and he and his fair spouse were renownedfor being the handsomest and happiestcouple in all valentiaas to don ambrosio he partially recoveredto the enjoyment of a broken constitution and ablasted name and hid his remorse and disgracesin a conventthe worthy alchymist took up his abode withhis children a pavilion in their garden wasassigned to him as a laboratory where he resumedhis researches after the grand secret hewas now and then assisted by his soninlawvol i the student of salamancabut the latter slackened grievously in his zeal anddiligence after marriage still he would listenwith profound gravity and attention to the oldman's quotations from paracelsus sandivogiusand peter d'abano which daily grew longerand longer in this way the good alchymistlived on quietly and comfortably to what is calleda good old age that is to say an age that isgood for nothing and unfortunately for mankindwas hurried out of life in his ninetiethyear just as he was on the point of discoveringthe philosopher's stonesuch was the story of the captain's friend which whiled away the whole morning verytolerably the captain was every now and theninterrupted by questions and remarks which ihave not mentioned lest i should break the continuityof the talehe was also a little disturbed once or twiceby the general who fell asleep and breathedthe student of salamanca rather hard to the great horror and annoyanceof lady lillycraft in a long and tender lovepassage also which was particularly to herladyship's taste the unlucky general having hishead a little sunk upon his breast kept makinga sound at regular intervals very much like theword pish long drawn out at length he madean odd guttural sound that suddenly woke him he hemmed looked about with a slight degreeof consternation and then began to play withher ladyship's work bag which however sherather pettishly withdrew the steady soundof the captain's voice however was too potenta soporific for the poor general he kept gleamingup and sinking in the socket until the cessationof the tale again roused him when hestarted awake put his foot down upon ladylilly craft's cur the sleeping beauty which yelledand seized him by the leg and in a momentthe whole library resounded with yelping andexclamations never did a man more completelymar his fortunes while he was asleepsilence was at length restored all the company the student op salamancaexpressed their thanks to the captain and gavevarious opinions of the story the parson saidhe should have liked to have heard more of theleaden manuscript dug up at granada the generalsaid he could not well make out the driftof the story he thought it a little confused iam glad however said he that they burnt theold chap of the tower for i have no doubt hewas a notorious impostor
