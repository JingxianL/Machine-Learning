the principal personages in thecomic part of the drama was as we havealready said a qusestionaryor pardoner oneof those itinerants who hawked about fromplace to place reliques real or pretendedwith

aftersuch grimace and buffoonery as befitted thesubject presented successively to each ofthe female personages of the drama notone of whom sustained the supposed testof discretion but to the infinite delight ofthe abbot the audience sneezed much louder andlonger than perhaps they themselves hadcounted on the jest seemed at last wornthreadbare and the pardoner was passingon to some new pleasantry

then acknowledge the favour by instantprostrationno one pities a jester overcome in hisvocation and the clown met with little sympathywhen rising from the ground andwhimpering forth his complaints of

official personsfirst approached the virago she threwherself into an attitude of firm defiance asif determined to resist their authority j andfrom the sample of strength and spirit whichshe had already displayed they shewed noalacrity at executing their commission buton half a minute's reflection the damselchanged totally her attitude and mannerfolded her cloak around her arms in modestand maidenlike fashion and walked of herown accord to the presence of the greatman followed and guarded by the two manfulsatellites as she moved across the vatheabbot cant space and more especially as she stoodat the footstool of the doctor's judgmentseatthe maiden discovered that lightnessand elasticity of step and natural grace ofmanner which connoisseurs in female beautyknow to be seldom divided

offence whereof thou hast been guiltyi command that all for the present goforward as if no such interruption of theprescribed course had taken placethe damsel curtsied and tripped back toher place the play proceeded but it nolonger attracted the attention of rolandgrammethe voice the figure and what the veilpermitted to be seen of the neck and tressesof the village damsel bore so strong a resemblanceto those of catherine setonthat he felt like one bewildered in the mazesof a changeful and studying dream thememorable scene of the hostelry rushed onhis recollection with all its doubtful andmarvellous circumstances were the talesof enchantment which he had read in romancesrealized in this extraordinary girl could she transport herself from the walledand guarded castle of lochleven moanedwith its broad lake towards which he cast the abbotback a look as if to ascertain it was still inexistenceand watched with such scrupulouscare as the safety of a nation demanded could she surmount all these obstaclesand make such careless and dangerous useof her liberty as to engage herself publiclyin a quarrel in a village fair roland wasunable to determine whether the exertionswhich it must have cost her to gain herfreedom or the use to which she had putit rendered her the most unaccountablecreaturelost in these meditations he kept hisgaze fixed on the subject of them and inevery casual motion discovered or thoughthe discovered something which remindedhim still more strongly of catherine setonit occurred to him more than once indeedthat he might be deceiving himself by exaggeratingsome casual likeness into absoluteidentity but then the meeting at thehostelry of saint michael's returned to hismind and it seemed in the highest degreeimprobable that under such various cirthe abbot substances mere imagination should twicehave found opportunity to play him the selfsametrick this time however he determinedto have his doubts resolved and forthis purpose he sate during the rest of theplay like a greyhound in the slip readyto spring upon the hare the instant that shewas started the damsel whom he watchedattentively lest she should escape inthe crowd when the spectacle was closedsate as if perfectly unconscious that she wasobserved but the worthy doctor markedthe direction of his eyes and magnanimouslysuppressed his own inclination to becomethe theseus to

page hardly heard the end of thelearned adage or the charge which thechamberlain gave him to be within reachin case of the pains arriving suddenly andsooner than expected so eager he was atonce to shake himself free of his learned associateand to satisfy his curiosity regardingthe unknown damsel yet in the hastethe abbot with which he made towards her he foundtime to reflect that in order to secure anopportunity of conversing with her in privatehe must not alarm her at first accostingher he therefore composed his mannerand gait and advancing with becoming selfconfidencebefore three or four countryfellowswho were intent on the same designbut knew not so well how to put their requestinto shape he acquainted her that heas the deputy of the venerable chamberlainrequested the honour of her hand as a partnerthe venerable chamberlain said thedamsel frankly reaching the page her hand does very well to exercise this part of hisprivilege by deputy and i suppose the lawsof the revels leave me no choice but to acceptof his faithful delegate providing fair damsel said the pagehis choice of a delegate is not altogetherdistasteful to you of that fair sir replied the maiden the abbot i will tell you more when we have dancedthe first measurewe have mentioned that catherine seytonhad admirable skill in gestic lore andthat she was sometimes called on to dancefor the amusement of her royal mistress rolandgraeme had often been a spectator ofher sml and sometimes at the queen's commandcatherine's partner on such occasionshe was therefore perfectly acquainted withcatherine's mode of dancing and observedthat his present partner in grace in agilityin quickness of ear and precision of executionexactly resembled her save that thescottish jigg which he now danced withher required a more violent and rapid motionand more rustic agility than the statelyparens lavoltas and counties whichhe had seen her execute in the chamber ofqueen mary the active duties of thedance left him little time for reflection andnone for conversation but when their jadesdeux was finished amidst the acclamathe abbot tions of the villagers who had seldom witnessedsuch an exhibition he took an opportunitywhen they yielded up the green toanother couple to use the privilege of apartner and enter into conversation withthe mysterious maiden whom he still heldby the hand fair partner may i notcrave the name of her who has graced methus far you may said the maiden but itis a question whether shall answer you and why asked roland because nobody gives anything for nothing and you can tell me nothing in returnwhich i care to hear could i not tell you my name and lineagein exchange for yours returnedroland no answered the maiden for youknow little of either how said the page somewhat angrilywrath you not for the matter saidthe damsel i will shew you in an instant the abbotthat i know more of you than you do ofyourself indeed answered graeme for whomthen do you take me for the wild

laughyou can switch men's eyes out of theirheads as well as the heart out of their bosomsthese last words were uttered in a lowand tender tone which to roland's greatmortification and somewhat to his displeasurewas so far from allaying that it greatlyincreased his partner's disposition tolaughter she could scarce compose herselfwhile she replied if you had thoughtmy hand so formidable extricating it fromhis grasp you would not have grasped itso hard but i perceive you know me sofully that there is no occasion to shew youmv face the abbot fair catherine said the page hewere unworthy ever to

surprise at the contrarieties which catherineseyton seemed to include in herperson and character you are surprised said the damsel tohim at what you see and hear but thetimes which make females men

not venture toexpress the opinion which he was irresistiblyinduced to formyes my son said the stranger observinghis embarrassment you do indeedthe abbot see before you the unfortunate father ambrosewho once accounted his ministrycrowned in your preservation from thesnares of heresy but who is now condemnedto lament thee as a castaway roland graeme's kindness of heart wasat least equal to his vivacity of temper hecould not bear to see his ancient and honouredmaster and spiritual guide in a situationwhich inferred a change of fortuneso melancholy but throwing himself at hisfeet grasped his knees and wept aloud what mean these tears my son saidthe abbot if they are shed for your ownsins and follies surely they are graciousshowers and may avail thee much butweep not if they fall on my account youindeed see the superior of the communityof saint mary's in the dress of a poor shorterwho gives his master the use of his bladeand buckler and if needful of his life for acoarse livery coat and four marks by theyear but such a garb suits the time and the abbotin the period of the church militant as wellbecomes her prelates as staff mitre andcrosier in the days of the church's triumph by what fate said the page and yetwhy added he checking himself needi ask catherine seyton in some sort preparedme for this but that the changeshould be so absolute the destruction socomplete yes my son said the abbot ambrosius thine own eyes beheld in my unworthyelevation to the abbot's stall thelast especial act of holy solemnity whichshall be seen in the church of saint mary'suntil it shall please heaven to turn back thecaptivity of the church for the present theshepherd is smitten ay well nigh to theearth the flock are scattered and theshrines of saints and martyrs and pious benefactorsto the church are given to theowls of night and the satyrs of the desertand your brother the knight of could he do nothing for your protectionthe abbot he himself hath fallen under the suspicionof the ruling powers said the abbot who are as unjust to their friends asthey are cruel to their enemies i couldnot grieve at it did i hope it might estrangehim from his course but i know the soulof halbert and i rather fear it will drivehim to prove his fidelity to their unhappycause by some deed which may be yet moredestructive to the church and rare offensiveto heaven enough of this and nowto the business of our meeting i trust youwill hold it sufficient if i pass my word toyou that the packet of which you were latelythe bearer was designed for my hands bygeorge of douglas then said the page is george ofdouglas a true friend to his queen rolandand will soon i trust have his eyes openedto the errors of his miscalled church but what is he to his father and whatto the lady of lochleven who has beenvol ill c the abbotas a mother to him said the page impatiently the best friend to both in time andthrough eternity said the abbot if heshall prove the happy instrument for redeemingthe evil they have wrought andare still working still said the page i like not thatgood service which begins in breach oftrusti blame not thy scruples my son saidthe abbot but the time which has wrenchedasunder the allegiance of christians tothe church and of subjects to their kinghas dissolved all the lesser bonds of society and in such days mere human ties must nomore restrain our progress than the bramblesand briars which catch hold of his garmentsshould delay the path of a pilgrimwho travels to pay his vowsbut my father said the youth andthen stopped short in a hesitating mannerspeak on my son said the abbot jspeak without fearccthe abbot let me not offend you then said roland when i say that it is even this whichour adversaries charge against us that shapingthe means according to the end we arewilling to commit great moral evil in orderthat we may work out eventual good the heretics have played their usualarts on you my son said the abbot theywould willingly deprive us of the powerof acting wisely and secretly though theirpossession of superior force forbids our contendingwith them on the terms of equalitythey have reduced us to a state of exhaustedweakness and now would fain proscribethe means by which weakness throughall the range of nature supplies the lackof strength and defends itself against itspotent enemies as well might the houndsay to the hare use not these wily turns toescape me but contend with me in pitchedbattle as the armed and powerful hereticdemand of the down trodden and oppressedcatholic to lay aside the wisdom of the serpentby which alone they may again hope the abbotto raise up the jerusalem over which theweep and which it is their duty to rebuildbut more of this hereafter and nowmy son i command thee on thy faith totell me truly and

two persons who were walkingin the garden the sound of whose conversationafter mingling for some time inthe page's dreams at length succeededin awaking him thoroughly he raisedhimself from his

from his grasp and in a tone where anger seemed to contend witha desire to laugh use you so little discretiontowards a daughter of seyton but as roland encouraged perhaps byher risibility to suppose his violence wasnot unpardonably offensive kept hold onher mantle she said in a sterner tone ofvmraixed resentment madman let mego there is life and death in this momenti would not willingly hurt thee

vpoison'd ill fare dead forsooth cast offking johnhowsoever weary roland graeme mightbe of the castle of lochleven howevermuch he might wish that the plan for mary'sescape had been perfected i questionif he ever awoke with more pleasing feelingsthan on the morning after george douglas'splan for accomplishing her deliverancehad been frustrated in the first placehe had the clearest conviction that he hadmisunderstood the inuendo of the abbotand that the affections of douglas were fixednot on catherine seyton but on thequeen and in the second place from thesort of explanation which had taken place betheabbot twixt the steward and him he felt himselfat liberty without any breach of honour towardsthe family of lochleven to contributehis best aid to any scheme which shouldin future be formed for the queen's escape and independently of the good will whichhe himself had to the enterprize he knewhe could find no surer road to the favour ofcatherine seyton he now sought but anopportunity to inform her that he had dedicatedhimself to this task and fortune waspropitious in affording him one which wasunusually favourableat the ordinary hour of breakfast it wasintroduced by the steward with the usualforms who as soon as it was placed on theboard in the inner apartment said to rolandgraeme with a glance of sarcastic import i leave you my young sir to dothe office of sewer it has been too longrendered to the lady mary by one belongingto the house of douglas were it the prime and principal who the abbotever bore the name said roland the officewere an honour to himthe steward departed without replying tothis bravade otherwise than by a dark lookof scorn graeme thus left alone busiedhimself as one engaged in a labour of loveto imitate as well as he could the graceand courtesy with which george of douglaswas wont to render his ceremonial serviceat meals to the queen of scotlandthere was more than youthful vanity there was a generous devotion in the feelingwith which he took up the task as a bravesoldier assumes the place of a comrade whohas fallen in the front of battle i amnow he said their only champion andcome weal come woe i will be to the bestof my skill and power as faithful as trustworthyas brave as any douglas of themall could have beenat this moment catherine seyton enteredalone contrary to her custom andnot less contrary to her custom she entertheabbot ed with her kerchief at her eyes rolandgraeme approached her with beating heartand with downcast eyes and asked her in alow and hesitating voiccjwhether the queenwere well can you suppose it said catherine think you her heart and body are framedof steel and iron to endure the cruel disappointmentof yester even and the infamoustaunts of yonder puritanic hag would to god that i were a man to aidher more effectually if those who carry pistols and batonsand poniards said the page are not menthey are at least amazons and that is as formidable you are welcome to the flash of yourwit sir replied the damsel i am neitherin spirits to enjoy or to reply to it well then said the page list to meinall serious truth and first let me saythat the gear last night had been smootherhad you taken me into your counsels and so we meant but who could have the abbotguessed that master page should chuse topass all night in the garden like some moonstrickenknight in a spanish romance insteadof being in his bedroom when douglascame to hold communication with himon our project and why said the page defer to solate a moment so important a confidence because your communications withhenderson and with pardon the naturalimpetuosity and fickleness of your dispositionmade us dread to entrust you with asecret of such consequence till the last moment and why at the last moment said thepage offended at this frank avowal whyat that or any other moment since i hadthe misfortune to incur so much suspicionnay now you are angry again saidcatherine and to serve you aright ishould break off this talk but i will bemagnanimous and answer your questionknow then our reason for trusting you wasthe abbot twofold in the first place we could scarceavoid it since you slept in the room throughwhich we had to pass in the secondplace nay said the page you may dispensewith a second reason when the firstmakes your confidence in me a case of necessitygood now hold thy peace said catherine in the second place as i said beforethere is one foolish person among uswho believes that roland graeme's heart iswarm though his head is giddy that hisblood is pure though it boils too hastilyandthat his faith and honour are true asthe loadstar though his tongue sometimesis far less than discreetthis avowal catherine repeated in a lowtone with her eyes fixed on the floor as ifshe shunned the glance of roland whileshe suffered it to escape her lips andthis single friend exclaimed the youth inrapture this only one who would do the abbottime to the poor roland graeme and whoseown generous heart taught her to distinguishbetween follies of the brain and faultsof the heart will you not tell me dearestcatherine to whom i owe my mostgrateful my most heartfelt thanks nay said catherine with her eyes stillfixed on the ground if your own hearttell you not dearest catherine said the page seizingupon her hand and kneeling on onekneeif your own heart i say tell you notsaid

batbearing an air of haughty aristocratic boldnessand even insolence in his look and mannerthat might have made dryfesdale concludehe had pretensions to superior rankhad not his experience taught him how frequentlythese airs of superiority were assumedby the domestics and military retainersof the scottish nobility the pilgrim'smorning to you old sir said the youth you come as i think from

the nakedweapon ran faster out thane entered kelticthe landlord stood by and helped neitherparty only exclaiming gentlemen gentlemen for the love of heaven andso forth a struggle ensued in which theyoung man chafed atdryfesdale's boldnessand unable with the ease he expected toextricate himself from the old man's determinedgrasp drew his dagger and with thespeed of light dealt him three wounds inthe breast and body the least of which wasmortal the old man sunk on the groundwith a deep groan and the host set up apiteous exclamation of surprise peace ye bawling hound said thewounded steward

past noon theusual hour of dinner yet no preparationsseemed made for the queen's entertainmentmary herself was retired into herown apartment where she was closely engagedin writing her attendants were

atthis surmise but comforted herself by observingthat the chimney of the kitchen hadreeked that whole day in a manner whichcontradicted the supposition catherineseyton presently exclaimed they

preceded the servants bearing thedishes and formally discharged the duty oftasting each of them lady fleming regrettedin courtly phrase that the ladyof lochleven should have undertaken sotroublesome an office after the strange incident of this daymadam said the lady it is necessary formy honour and that of my son that i partakewhatever is offered to my involuntaryguest please to inform the lady

and attendant as usual butnotwithstanding what the queen had saidthe meal was silent and unsocial and everyeffort which mary made to excite some conversationdied away under the solemn andchill replies of the lady of lochleven atlength it became plain that the queen whohad considered her advances as a condenseabbot ascension on her part and who piqued herselfjustly on her powers of pleasing became offendedat the repulsive conduct of her hostessafter looking with a significant glanceat lady fleming and catherine she slightlyshrugged her shoulders and remained silenta pause ensued at the end of whichthe lady douglas spoke i perceivemadam i am a check on the mirth of thisfair company i pray you to excuse me i am a widow alone here in a most perilouscharge deserted by my grandson betrayed by my servant i am little worthyof the grace you do me in offering me aseat at your table where i am aware thatwit and pastime are usually expected fromthe guests if the lady lochleven is serious saidthe queen we wonder by what simplicityshe expects our present meals to be seasonedwith mirth if she is a widow shelives honoured and uncontrouled at thehead of her late husband's household butvol iir kgl the abboti know at least of one widowed woman inthe world before whom the words desertionand betrayal ought never to be mentionedsince no one has been made so bitterlyacquainted with their importi meant not to remind you of yourmisfortunes by the mention of mine answeredthe lady lochleven and there wasagain a deep silencemary at length addressed lady fleming we can commit no deadly sins here vuttonnes where we are so well warded andlooked to but if we could this carthusiansilence might be useful as a kind of penanceif thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss myfleming or if catherine hath made a wrystitch in her broidery when she was thinkingof something else than her work or ifroland graeme hath missed a wildduck onthe wing and broke a quarrelpane of glassin the turret window as chanced to

lady lochlevensaid the queen i perceive youwould eke out your duty with that of ourfather confessor and since you chuse thatour conversation should be serious may iask you why the regent's promise sinceyour son so styles himself has not beenkept to me in that respect from time totime this promise has been renewed andas constantly broken methinks those whopretend themselves to so much gravity andsanctity should not debar from others thereligious succours which their consciencesrequire madam the earl of murray was indeedweak enough said the lady lochleven to give so far way to your unhappy the abbotprejudices and a religion of the popepresented himself on his part at our townof kinross but the douglas is lord ofhis own castle and will not permit histhreshold to be darkened no not for a singlemoment by an emissary belonging tothe bishop of rome methinks it were well then said mary that my lord regent would send mewhere there is less scruple and more charityin this madam answered the ladylochleven you mistake the nature bothof charity and of religion charity givethto those who are in delirium the medicamentswhich may avail their health butrefuses those enticing cates and

youwell till curfew time when i will makeperchance more bold than welcome in attendingupon your supper board comewith me randal and tell me more of thiscruel facttis an extraordinary chance said thequeen when she had departed andthe abbot villain as he was i would this man had beenspared time for repentance we will causesomething to be done for his soul if weeverattain our liberty and the church willpermit such grace to an heretic but tellme catherine ma mignonne this brother ofthine who is ofracky as the fellow calledhim bears he the same wonderful likenessto thee as formerly if your grace means in temper youknow whether lam ofrack as the servingmanspoke himnay thou art prompt enough in allreasonable conscience replied the queen but thou art my own darling notwithstanding but i meant is this thy twinbrotheras like thee in form and featuresas formerly i remember thy dear motheralleged it as a reason for destining thee tothe veil that were ye both to go at largethou wouldst surely get the credit of someof thy brother's mad pranks i believe madam said catherine there are some unusually simple peoplek g the abboteven yet who can hardly distinguish betwixtus especially when for diversion'ssake my brother hath taken a female dressand as she spoke she gave a quick glanceat roland grseme to whom this conversationconveyed a ray of light welcome asever streamed into the dungeon of a captivethrough the door which opened to givehim freedom he must be a handsome cavalier thisbrother of thine if he be so like you repliedmary he was in france i thinkfor these late years

amongst our young noblesgod knows i grudge not his life inyour grace's quarrel j and love him for thewillingness with which he labours for yourrescue but wherefore should he brawlwith an old ruffianly servingman and stainthe abbot at once his name with such a broil and hishands with the blood of an old and ignoblewretch nay be patient catherine i will nothave thee traduce my gallant young knightwith henry for my knight and rolandgramme for my trusty squire methinks i amlike a princess of romance who may shortlyset at defiance the dungeons and the weaponsof all wicked sorcerers but my

historiesand thou hast brought la comiqued'armurtonce embarked upon the sea of historiesthe queen continued her labours with herneedle while lady fleming and catherineread to her alternately for two hoursas to roland graeme it is probable thathe continued in secret intent upon the chronicleof love notwithstanding the censure the abbotwhich the queen seemed to pass upon thatbranch of study he now remembered athousand circumstances of voice and mannerwhich had his own prepossession beenless must surely have discriminated the brotherfrom the sister and he felt ashamedthat having as it were by heart every particularof catherine's gestures words andmanners he should have thought her notwithstandingher spirits and levity capablecf assuming the bold step loud tones andforward assurance which accorded wellenough with her brother's hasty and masculinecharacter he endeavoured repeatedlyto catch a glance of catherine's eyethat he might judge how she was disposedto look upon him since he had made thediscovery but he was unsuccessful for catherinewhen she was not reading herselfseemed to take so much interest in the exploitsof the teutonic knights against theheathens of esthonia and livonia that hecould not surprise her eye even for a secondbut when closing the book the queen comtheabbot landed their attendance in the gardenmary perhaps of set purpose for roland'sanxiety could not escape so practised an observerafforded him a favourable opportunityof accosting his mistress the queencommanded them to a little distance whileshe engaged lady fleming in a particularand private conversation the subject whereofwe learn from another authority to havebeen the comparative excellence of the highstanding ruff and the falling band rolandmust have been duller and more sheepishthan ever was youthful lover if he had notendeavoured to avail himself of this opportunityi have been longing this whole eveningto ask of you fair catherine said thepage how foolish and unapprehensive youmust have thought me in being capable tomistake betwixt your brother and you the circumstance does indeed little honourto my rustic manners said catherinesince those of a wild young man were soreadily mistaken for mine but i shall grow the abbotwiser in time and with that view i am determinednot to think of your follies butto correct my own it will be the lighter subject of meditationof the two said roland i know not that said catherine verygravely i fear we have been both unpardonablyfoolish i have been mad said roland unpardonablymad but you lovely catherine i said catherine in the same tone ofunusual gravity have too long sufferedyou to use such expressions towards me i fear i can permit it no longer and i blamemyself for the pain it may give youand what can have happened so suddenlyto change our relation to each otheror alter with such sudden cruelty yourwhole deportment to me i can hardly tell replied catherine unless it is that the events of the day haveimpressed on my mind the necessity of ourobserving more distance to each other athe abbot chance similar to that which betrayed to youthe existence of my brother may makeknown to henry the terms you have usedto me and alas his whole conduct aswell as his deed this day makes me too justlyapprehensive of the consequences fear nothing for that fair catherineanswered the page i am well able toprotect myself against risks of that naturethat is to say replied she that youwould fight with my twinbrother to shewyour regard for his sister i have heardthe queen say in her sad hours that menare in love or in hate the most selfish animalsof creation and your carelessness inthis matter looks very like it but be notso much abashed you are no worse thanothersyou do me injustice catherine repliedthe page i thought but of beingthreatened with a sword and did not rememberin whose hand your fancy hadplaced it if your brother stood before mewith his drawn weapon in his hand so like the abbotas be is to you in word

we have met in equalityand i may say in intimacy you thinknot that whenever i reenter my father'shouse there is a gulph between us you maynot pass but with peril of your life youronly known relative

gratitudeyou must remember i am wholly subjectedto my father and the poor queen is for along time more likely to be dependent onthe pleasure of the nobles of her partythan possessed of power to controul thembe it so replied roland my deedsshall controul prejudice itself it is a bustlingworld and i will have my share theknight of avenel high as he now standsrose from as obscure an origin as

answered the lady lochlevenwith much gravity the history of scotlandmay teach me how ill the duty is performedwhich is done by an accredited deputy we have heard madam of favouritesof later date and as little merit as oliversinclair o madam replied the queen myfather had his female as well as his male fatheabbot favourites there were the ladies sandilandsvand olifaiint and some others methinks but their names cannot survive in the memoryof so grave a person as youthe lady lochleven looked as if shecould have slain the queen on the spot butcommanded her temper and retired fromthe apartment

firm land and protectionwhen you are theretrust us for that roland said thequeen for to that point our scheme isindifferent well laidthen if your grace will permit me tospeak my mind i think i could be of someuse in this matter as how my good youth speak onsaid the queen and fearlessly my patron the knight of avenel usedto compel the youth educated in his householdto learn the use of axe and hammerand working in wood and iron he used tospeak of old northern champions who forgedtheir own weapons and of the highlandcaptain donald nan ord or donaldof the hammer whom he himself knewand who used to work at the anvil with asledgehammer in each hand some saidhe praised this art because he was himselfof churl's blood however i gained somepractice in it as the lady catherine sey tonthe abbot partly knows for since we were here iwrought her a silver broachay replied catherine but youshould tell her grace that your workmanshipwas so indifferent that it broke to piecesnext day and i flung it away believe her not roland said thequeen she wept when it was brokenand put the fragments into her bosom butfor your scheme could your skill avail toforge a second set of keys no madam because i know not thewards but i am convinced i could makea set so like that hateful bunch which thelady bore off even now that could they beexchanged against them by any means shewould never dream she was possessed of thewrongand the good dame thank heaven issomewhat blind said the queen butthen for a forge my boy and the means oflabouring unobserved the armourer's forge at which i usedsometimes to

nature of your work is notdiscoverednay i will take the liberty to draw thebolt against chance visitors so that i willhave time to put away what am workingupon before i undo the door will not that of

whichwere presented every evening to the ladylochleven that on a slight inspection itwould have been difficult to perceive thethe abbot difference he brought them to the darkrusty colour by the use of salt and water and in the triumph of his art presentedthem at length to queen mary in her about an hour before thetolling of the curfew she looked at themwith pleasure but at the same time withdoubts i allow she said that thelady lochleven's eyes which are not ofthe clearest may be well deceived couldwe pass those keys on her in place of thereal implements of her tyranny but howis this to be done and which of my littlecourt dare attempt this tour de jongleurwith any chance of success could we butengage her in some earnest matter of argument but those which i hold with heralways have been of a

questions of the woman lochleven tellingher the very truth which yet she receivednot as such t the abbotroland thought in his heart that whenthe truth was spoken for the purpose of deceivingit was little better than a lie in disguisebut it was no time to agitate suchquestions of conscienceand now for the signal from the shoreexclaimed catherine my bosom tells mewe shall see this night two

militarytalents of murray morton the lairdof grange and others who had been trainedfrom their youth in foreign and domesticwarsin these circumstances it was the obviouspolicy of queen mary to avoid a conflictsecure that were her person once insafety the number of her adherents mustdaily increase whereas the forces of thoseopposed to her must as had frequentlyhapopened in the previous history of her reignhave diminished and their spirits becomebroken and so evident was this to hercounsellors that they resolved their firststep should be to place the queen in thestrong castle of dumbarton there to awaitthe course of events the arrival of succoursfrom france and the levies whicha the abbotwere made by her adherents in every provinceof scotland accordingly orderswere given that all men should
