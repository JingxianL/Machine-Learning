the publishers the collection standard
novels are extremely desirous that i should furnish
them with a few lines by way introduction to the
appearance st leon in its present form i am
however at a loss how to oblige them in the original
 i frankly stated the sources upon which i had
drawn for the idea and conduct the work i have
therefore no remarks to offer but these which follow
in i produced the novel caleb williams i
believed myself fortunate in the selection i had made
 the groundplot that work an atrocious
crime committed by a man previously the most
exemplary habits the annoyance he suffers from the
immeasurable and everwakeful curiosity a raw youth
who is placed about his person the state doubt in
which the reader might for a time be as to the truth
 the charges and the consequences growing out 
these causes seemed to me to afford scope for a narrative
 no common interest i was not disappointed
caleb williams was honoured with the public favour
the consequence was that i was solicited to try my
hand again in a work fiction i hesitated long i
despaired finding again a topic so rich interest
and passion in those days it was deemed a most
daring thought to attempt to write a novel with the
hope that it might hereafter rank among the classics
 a language the most successful english writers

in that province literature had scarcely gone
beyond three it had not then been conceived that the
same author might produce twenty or thirty at the
rate two or three per annum and might still at least
retain his hold upon the partiality his contemporaries
to sir walter scott we are indebted for this
discovery
at length after having passed some years in a
state diffidence and irresolution i ventured on the
task it struck me that if i could mix human feelings
and passions with incredible situations i might
thus attain a sort novelty that would conciliate the
patience at least even some the severest judges
to this way thinking st leon was indebted for a
local habitation and a name
one my most valued friends mr northcote
has often told me that the public may sometimes be
interested in the perusal a but that they never
give themselves any trouble about the author he
therefore kindly advised me on no occasion to say anything
in print about myself the present race 
readers seem scarcely disposed to verify this maxim
they are understood to be desirous to learn something
 the peculiarities the life character and behaviour
 an author before they consign him to the
gulph oblivion and are willing to learn from his own
testimony what train thoughts induced him to adopt
the particular subject and plan the work upon the
perusal which they are engaged
june 

the following passage from a work said to be written by
the late dr john campbel and entitled hermippus re
divivusj suggested the first hint the present performance

there happened in the year an odd accident at
venice that made a very great stir then and which i
think deserves to be rescued from oblivion the great
freedom and ease with which all persons who make a good
appearance live in that city is known sufficiently to all
who are acquainted with it such will not therefore be surprised
that a stranger who went by the name signor
gualdi and who made a considerable figure there was
admitted into the best company though nobody knew who
or what he was he remained at venice for some months
and three things were remarked in his conduct the first
was that he had a small collection fine pictures which
he readily showed to any body that desired it the next
that he was perfectly versed in all arts and sciences and
spoke on every subject with such readiness and sagacity as
astonished all who heard him and it was in the third place
observed that he never wrote or received any letter never
desired any credit or made use bills exchange but
paid for every thing in ready money and lived decently
though not in splendour
cf this gentleman met one day at the coffeehouse with
a venetian nobleman who was an extraordinary good judge
 pictures he had heard signor gualdi's collection and
in a very polite manner desired to see them to which the
other very readily consented after the venetian had

viewed signer gualdi's collection and expressed his satisfaction
by telling him that he had never seen a finer considering
the number pieces which it consisted he cast
his eye by chance over the chamberdoor where hung a
picture this stranger the venetian looked upon it and
then upon him this picture was drawn for you sir
says he to signor gualdi to which the other made no answer
but by a low bow you look continued the venetian
 like a man fifty and yet i know this picture to
be the hand titian who has been dead one hundred
and thirty years how is this possible it is not easy
said signor gualdi gravely to know all things that are
possible but there is certainly no crime in my being like
a picture drawn by titian the venetian easily perceived
by his manner speaking that he had given the stranger
offence and therefore took his leave

there is nothing that human imagination can figure
brilliant and enviable that human genius and skill do not
aspire to realize in the early ages antiquity one 
the favourite topics speculation was a perfect system 
civil policy and no sooner had plato delineated his imaginary
republic than he sought for a spot earth upon
which to execute his plan in my own times and for
upwards a century before them the subject which has
chiefly occupied men intrepid and persevering study
has been the great secret nature the opus magnum in
its two grand and inseparable branches the art multiplying
gold and defying the inroads infirmity and
death
it is notorious that uncommon talents and unparalleled
industry have been engaged in this mighty task it has
i know been disputed by the audacious adversaries 
all sober and reasonable evidence whether these talents
and industry have in any case attained the object they
sought it is not to my purpose to ascertain the number
 those whose victory over the powers and inertness 
matter has been complete it is enough that i am a living
instance the existence such men to these two secrets
if they are to be considered as two i have been for
years in the habit resorting for my gratification i have
in my possession the choice being as wealthy as i please
and the gift immortal life every thing that i see
almost i can without difficulty make my own for what
palaces pictures parks or gardens rarities art or nature
have not a price at which their owner will consent to yield
b
 travels st leon
them the luxuries every quarter the world are
emptied at my feet i can command to an extent almost
inconceivable the passions men what heart can withstand
the assault princely magnificence what man is
inaccessible to a bribe add to these advantages that i am
invulnerable to disease every sun that rises finds the
circulations my frame in the most perfect order decrepitude
can never approach me a thousand winters want
the power to furrow my countenance with wrinkles or
turn my hairs to silver exhaustless wealth and eternal
youth are the attributes by which i am distinguished from
the rest mankind
i do not sit down now to write a treatise natural philosophy
the condition by which i hold my privileges is
that they must never be imparted i sit down purely to
relate a few those extraordinary events that have been
produced in the period my life which is already elapsed
by the circumstances and the peculiarity to which i have
just alluded
it is so obvious as to make it almost improper to specify
it that the pursuit in which so many my contemporaries
are engaged and the which i have so singularly
achieved is in its appearance infinitely more grand and
interesting than that which occupied the thoughts plato
and the most eminent writers antiquity what is political
liberty compared with unbounded riches and immortal
vigour the immediate application political liberty is
to render a man's patrimony or the fruits his industry
completely his own and to preserve them from the invasion
 others but the petty detail preservation or gradual
acquisition can never enter into competition with the great
secret which endows a man in a moment with everything
that the human heart can wish considered in this
light how mean and contemptible does the ambition the
boasted ancients appear compared with ours what adept
or probationer the present day would be content to
resign the study god and the profounder secrets 
nature and to bound his ardour to the investigation his
miserable existence 
it may seem perhaps to many that the history a per
travels op st leon 
son possessed advantages so unparalleled as mine must
be like the history paradise or the future happiness
 the blessed too calm and motionless too much one
invariable texture and exempt from vicissitude to excite
the attention or interest the passions the reader if he
will have patience and apply to the perusal my narrative
he will in no long time perceive how far his conjecture
is founded in sagacity and reason
some persons may be curious to know what motives can
have induced a man such enormous wealth and so every
way qualified to revel in delights to take the trouble 
penning his memoirs the immortality with which i ani
endowed seems to put out the question the common motives
that relate to posthumous fame
the curiosity here mentioned if it really exists i cannot
consent to gratify i will anticipate nothing in the
progress my story my motive for recording it will probably
become evident
i am descended from one the most ancient and honourable
families the kingdom france i was the only
child my father who died while i was an infant my
mother was a woman rather a masculine understanding
and full the prejudices nobility and magnificence
her whole soul was in a manner concentrated in the ambition
to render me the worthy successor the counts de
st leon who had figured with distinguished reputation in
the wars the holy land my father had died fighting
gallantly in the plains italy under the standard louis
the twelfth a prince whose name was never repeated tome
unaccompanied with the praises due to his military
prowess and to the singular humanity disposition by
which he acquired the title the father his people my
mother's mind was inflamed with the greatness my ancestors
and she indefatigably sought to kindle in my bosom
a similar flame it has been a longestablished custom for
the barons and feudal vassals the kings france to
enter with great personal expense into the brilliant and
dazzling expeditions their sovereigns and my father
greatly impaired his fortune in preparations for that very
campaign in which he terminated his life my mother
b 
 travels st leon
industriously applied herself to the restoration my patrimony
 and the long period my minority afforded her
scope for that purpose
it was impossible for any boy to be treated with more
kindness and considerate indulgence than i was during the
period my adolescence my mother loved me to the
very utmost limits perhaps human affection i washer
darling and her pride her waking study and her nightly
dream yet i was not pampered into corporeal imbecility
or suffered to rust in inactivity mind i was provided
with the best masters i was excited and successfully excited
zealously to apply myself to the lessons they taught
i became intimately acquainted with the italian writers 
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries i was initiated in the
study the classics to the cultivation which the revival
 letters at this time gave particular ardour i was instructed
in the principles the fine arts there was no
species accomplishment at that time in vogue that my
mother was not anxious i should make my own the only
science i neglected was the very science which has since
given rise to the most extraordinary events my life but
the object to which my attention was principally called
was the pursuit military exercises and the cultivation 
every thing that could add to the strength agility or grace
 my body and to the adventurousness and enterprise 
my mind my mother loved my honour and my fame
more than she loved my person
a circumstance that tended perhaps more than any other
to fix the yet fluctuating character my youthful mind
was my being present as a spectator at the celebrated meeting
between francis the first and henry the eighth king
 england in a field between ardres and guineas my
mother refused to accompany me being already arrived at
an age in which curiosity and the love festive scenes are
usually diminished and the expenses incurred by all the
nobility who attended upon this scene being incompatible
with the economy to which she rigidly adhered i was
therefore placed under the protection the marquis de
villeroy her brother and with two servants who attended
me formed a part his suite
travels st leon o
i was at this time fifteen years age my contemplations
had been familiar with ideas magnificence and
grandeur but my life had been spent in the most sequestered
retirement this contrast had a particular effect
upon my disposition it irritated to a very high degree my
passion for splendour and distinction i lived in the fairy
fields visionary greatness and was more than indifferent
to the major part the objects around me i pined for
every thing the reverse my present condition i cultivated
the exercises in which i was engaged only as they
were calculated to prepare me for future achievements
by the incident i have mentioned i was transported at
once from a scene modest obscurity to a scene the
most lavish splendour that the world perhaps ever contemplated
i never remembered to have seen even paris itself
the prevailing taste europe has for some time led very
much to costliness in dress this taste in its present profusion
i believe took its rise in the field the vale 
ardres the two kings were both in the vigour their
youth and were said to be the handsomest men the age
in which they lived the beauty henry was sturdy and
muscular that francis more refined and elegant without
subtracting in any considerable degree from the firmness
 his make henry was four years older than his
brother monarch the first them might have been taken
as a model to represent a youthful hercules and the last an
apollo
the splendour dress that was worn upon this occasion
exceeds almost all credibility every person distinction
might be said in a manner to carry an estate upon his
shoulders nor was the variety garments inferior to the
richness wolsey a man whose magnificence disposition
was only surpassed by the pride his soul was for the
most part the director the whole he possessed the most
absolute ascendancy over the mind his master at the
same time that francis artfully indulged his caprice that
he might claim from him in return a similar indulgence in
weightier matters
the pomp processions and the ceremony opening
this memorable festival went first a sort solemn and
b 
travels st leon
halfmoving pageant which the eye took in at leisure and
took in till it was filled this was succeeded by everything
that was rapid animated and interesting masques
and exhibitions ah kinds and which was still more tome
and which my soul devoured with indescribable ardour
hustings tilts and tournaments without the beauty
 the armour the caparisons the steeds the mettle 
the animals themselves and the ardour and grace the
combatants surpassed every thing that my fancy had ever
painted these scenes were acted in the midst a vast
amphitheatre spectators where all that was noble and
eminent either country was assembled the manliness 
aspiring youth and the boundless varieties female attraction
all were in their gayest attire every eye was
lighted up with complacency and joy if heraclitus or
any other morose philosopher who has expatiated on the
universal misery mankind had entered the field ardres
he must have retracted his assertions or fled from the
scene with confusion the kings were placed at either 
 the lists surrounded with their courtiers every eye
through this vast assembly was fixed upon the combatants 
the body every one present was inclined this way or that
in unconscious sympathy with the redoubled knights from
time to time as the favourites either party prevailed the
air was rent with shouts and acclamations
what added to the fascination all that i have yet
mentioned was that now for the first time in an equal
degree perhaps for centuries the stiffness unwieldy form
was laid aside and the heart man expanded itself with
generosity and confidence it burst the fetters ages 
and having burst them it seemed to revel in its newfound
liberty it is well known that after a few days idle
precaution and specious imprisonment on both sides francis
one morning mounted his horse and appeared without
guards or any previous notice before the tent henry
the example was contagious and from this time all ceremony
was laid aside the kings themselves entered personally
into the combats their subjects it was a
delightful and a ravishing spectacle to witness the freedom
 the old roman manners almost the old roman saturn
 st leon 
alia polished and refined with all that was graceful and
humane in the age chivalry
it may easily be imagined what an effect a scene like
this was calculated to produce upon a youth my age and
my education i recollected with anguish that the immaturity
 my years precluded me from taking any active
part in the spectacle my appearance however was sufficiently
advantageous i was presented to francis the
first he did me the honour to question me respecting
my studies and finding in me some knowledge those
arts and that literature which he was himself so zealous
a favourer he expressed to my uncle a great satisfaction
with my figure and acquisitions i might from this time
have been taken to court and made one the pages to
this illustrious monarch but the plan my mother was
different she did not wish for the present that my eye
should be satiated with public scenes or that the public
should grow too familiarly acquainted with my person she
rightly judged that my passion for the theatre glory
would grow more impetuous by being withheld for sometime
from the gratifications for which it panted she wished
that i should present myself for the first time among
the nobility france an accomplished cavalier and not
suffer the disadvantage having exposed in the eye the
world those false steps and frailties from which the inexperience
 youth is never entirely free these motives being
explained to the king he was graciously pleased to
sanction them with his approbation i accordingly returned
to finish the course my education at my paternal chateau
upon the banks the garonne
the state my mind during the three succeeding years
amply justified the sagacity my mother i was more
eager for improvement than i had ever yet been i
had before formed some conceptions the career honour
from the books i had read and from the conversation 
this excellent matron but my reveries were impotent and
little compared with what i had now seen like the author
 our holy religion i had spent my forty days without
food in the wilderness when suddenly my eyes were
opened and i was presented with all the kingdoms the
b 
travels st leon
world and all the glory them the fairy scene continued
for a moment and then vanished leaving nothing
behind it on all sides but the same barrenness and gloom
by which it had been preceded i never shut my eyes
without viewing in imagination the combats knights and
the train ladies i had been regarded with distinction
by my sovereign and francis the first stood before my
mind the abstract and model perfection and greatness
i congratulated myself upon being born in an age and
country so favourable to the acquisition all that my soul
desired
i was already eighteen years age when i experienced
the first misfortune that ever befel me it was the death
 my mother she felt the approach her dissolution
several weeks before it arrived and held repeated conversations
with me respecting the feelings i ought to entertain
and the conduct it would become me to pursue when she
should be no more
my son said she your character and the promise
 your early years have constituted my only consolation
since the death your excellent father our marriage
was the result a most sincere and exclusive attachment 
and never did man more deserve to be loved than reginald
de st leon when he died the whole world would have
been nothing to me but one vast blank if he had not left
behind him the representative his person and the heir
to his virtues while i was busied in your education i
seemed to be discharging the last duty to the memory 
my husband the occupation was sacred to the honour 
the dead even before it became so peculiarly pleasing tome
upon its own account as i afterwards found it i hope
i have in some measure discharged the task in the manner
in which my lord your father would have wished it to have
been discharged if he had lived i am thankful to heaven
that i have been spared so long for so dear and honourable
a purpose
you must now my son stand by yourself and be the
arbitrator your own actions i could have wished that
this necessity might have been a little further deferred 
but i trust your education has not been that sort which
travels st leon 
is calculated to render a young man helpless and contemptible
you have been taught to know your rank in society
and to respect yourself you have been instructed in everything
that might most effectually forward you in the career
 glory there is not a young cavalier among all the nobility
 france more accomplished or that promises to do
greater honour to his name and his country i shall not
live to witness the performance this promise but the
anticipation even now pours a long stream sunshine on
my departing hour
farewell my son you no longer stand in need 
my maternal care when i am gone you will be compelled
more vividly to feel that singleness and selfdependence
which are the source all virtue be careful yourself
be careful that your career may be both spotless and
illustrious hold your life as a thing no account when
it enters into competition with your fame a true knight
thinks no sacrifice and suffering hard that honour demands
be humane gentle generous and intrepid be prompt
to follow wherever your duty calls you remember your
ancestors knights the holy cross remember your
father follow your king who is the mirror valour 
and be ever ready for the service the distressed may
providence be your guardian may heaven shower down
a thousand blessings upon your innocence and the gallantry
 your soul 
the death my mother was a severe blow to my heart
for some time all the visions greatness and renown which
had hitherto been my chosen delight appeared distasteful
to me i hung over her insensible corpse when it had
been committed to the earth i repaired every day to the
spot where it was deposited at the hour dusk when all
visible objects faded from the eye when nature assumed
her saddest tints and the whole world seemed about to be
wrapped in the darkness the tomb the dew night
drizzled unheeded on my head and i did not turn again
towards the turrets the chateau till the hour midnight
had already sounded through the stillness the scene
time is the healer almost every grief particularly in
the sprightly season early youth in no long period
 travels st leon 
i changed the oppression inactive sorrow for the affectionate
and pious recollection my mother's last instructions
i had been too deeply imbued with sentiments 
glory for it to be possible when the first excess grief
was over that i should remain in indolence the tender
remembrance my mother itself in no long time furnished
a new stimulus to my ambition i forgot the melancholy
spectacle the last struggles her expiring life
i even became accustomed no longer to hear her voice no
longer to expect her presence when i returned to the chateau
from a short excursion her last advice was now all that
survived the author my existence
chapter ii
i was in this state mind when early one morning in the
beginning summer soon after i rose i was startled by
the sound trumpets in the plain near the chateau the
bugle at the gate was presently sounded the drawbridge
was let down and the marquis de villeroy entered the
courtyard accompanied by about thirty knights in complete
armour i saluted him with respect and the tenderness
excited by recent grief he took me by the hand
after a short repast in the hall and led me to my closet
my son said he it is time to throw off the effeminacy
 sorrow and to prove yourself a true soldier 
the standard france
i trust my lord replied i with modest earnestness
 that you well know there is nothing after which my heart
so ardently aspires there is nothing that i know worth
living for but honour show me the path that leads to it
or rather show me the occasion that affords scope for the
love honour to display itself and you shall then see
whether i am backward to embrace it i have a passion
pent up within me that feeds upon my vitals it disdains
speech it burns for something more unambiguous and substantial

travels st leon 
it is well rejoined my uncle i expected to find
you thus your reply to my admonition is worthy the
blood your ancestors and the maternal instructions
 my sister and were you as dull as the very stones
you tread on what i have to tell you might even then rouse
you into animation and ardour
after this short my uncle proceeded to relate a
tale every word which inflamed my spirits and raised
all my passions in arms i had heard something imperfectly
 the state my country but my mother carefully
kept me in ignorance that my ambition might not be excited
too soon and that when excited it might be with the
fullest effect while i impatiently longed for an occasion
 glory i was far from apprehending what i now found
to be true that the occasion which at this period presented
itself was such that all the licence fiction could scarcely
have improved it
the marquis de villeroy described to me the league now
subsisting against france he revived in my memory by
terms the most fervent loyalty the accomplishments and
talents my royal master he spoke with aversion the
phlegmatic and crafty disposition his imperial rival 
and with the language glowing indignation inveighed
against the fickleness the capricious henry t he described
the train disasters which had at length induced
the king to take the field in person he contrasted with
great effect the story the gallant chevalier bayard the
knight without fear and without reproach whose blood was
still fresh in the plains the milanese with that the
constable bourbon the stain chivalry whom inglorious
resentment and ungoverned ambition had urged to join the
enemies his country in neglect his loyalty and his
oath he stimulated me by the example the one and
the infamy the other and assured me that there never
was an opportunity more favourable for acquiring immortal
renown
i wanted no prompter in a passion this sort and immediately
set about collecting the whole force my clients
and retainers i shook off the inglorious softness my
charles v f henry viii
 travels st leon
melancholy and was all activity and animation the lessons
 my youth were now called into play i judged it
necessary to invite the assistance some person experience
to assist me in marshalling my men but i did much
 what was to be done myself and i did it well it was
my first employment in the morning and the last that was
witnessed by the setting sun my excellent mother had
left my revenues in the best order and i spared no expense
in the gratification my favourite passion
however eager i felt myself to take the field the desire
to appear in a manner worthy a count de st leon restrained
me and i did not join the royal army till the
imperialists having broken up the siege marseilles and
retreated with precipitation into italy the king had already
crossed the alps entered the milanese and gained un contested
possession the capital
from milan francis proceeded to pavia glory was the
idol his heart and he was the more powerfully excited
to the attack that place because it was the strongest and
best fortified post in the whole duchy the more he displayed
 military prowess the more firmly he believed he
should fix himself in his newly acquired dominions the
inhabitants would submit to him the more willingly and
the enemy be less encouraged to enter into a fresh contention
for what he had acquired such at least were the
motives that he assigned for his proceedings in reality
perhaps he was principally induced by the brilliancy which
he conceived would attend on the undertaking
it was a few weeks after the opening the siege that
i presented myself to my royal master he received me
with those winning and impressive manners by which he
was so eminently distinguished he recollected immediately
all that had passed at our interview in the vale 
ardres and warmly expressed the obligations which france
had at various times owed to my ancestors he spoke with
earnest respect the virtues and wisdom my mother
and commended the resolution by which she had in former
instances held me back from the public theatre young
gentleman said the king i doubt not the gallantry 
your spirit i see the impatience a martial temper writ 
travels op st leon 
ten in your face i expect you to act in a manner worthy
 your illustrious race and the instructions a woman
who deserved to be herself a pattern to all the matrons 
france fear not that i shall suffer your accomplishments
to rust in obscurity i shall employ you i shall assign
you the post danger and renown fill it nobly and
from that hour i shall rank you in the catalogue my
chosen friends
the siege pavia proved indeed to be a transaction in
the course which military honour might well be acquired
it was defended by a small but veteran garrison and by
one the ablest captains that europe at that time possessed
he interrupted the approaches the besiegers
by frequent and furious sallies in vain by the aid our
excellent artillery did we make wide and repeated breaches
in the fortifications no sooner did we attempt to enter by
the passage we had opened than we found ourselves encountered
by a body composed the choicest and bravest
soldiers the garrison the governor the city who
though greyheaded and advanced in years was profuse 
every youthful exertion was ordinarily at the head this
body if we deferred our attack or not having succeeded
in it proposed to commence it anew with the dawn the
following day we were sure to find a new wall sprung up
in the room the other as if by enchantment frequently
the governor anticipated the success our batteries 
and the old fortification was no sooner demolished than we
beheld to our astonishment and mortification a new wall
which his prudence and skill had erected at a small interval
within the line the former
one these attacks took place on the second day after
my arrival at the camp our sovereign every thing that
i saw was new to me and inflamed me with ardour the
noise the cannon which had preceded the attack and
which was now hushed the inspiring sounds martial
music which succeeded that noise the standards floating
in the air the firm and equal tread the battalion that
advanced the armour the knights the rugged resolute
and intrepid countenances the infantry all swelled my
antonio de leyva
travels op st leon
soul with transport hitherto unexperienced i had beheld
the smoke the artillery in the midst which everything
was lost and confounded i had waited in awful
suspense till the obscurity should be dissipated i saw with
pleasure and surprise the ruin the wall and the wideness
 the breach all that had been recorded the military
feats christian valour seemed then to stand crowded in
my busy brain the generosity the condescension the kindness
with which the king had addressed me the day before
urged me to treble exertion i was in the foremost rank
we surmounted the ditch we were resisted by a chosen
body spaniards the contention was obstinate brave
men generous and enterprising spirits fell on the one side
and the other i seized the cloth a standard as in the
playing the wind it was brought near to my hand between
me and the spaniard that held it there ensued an obstinate
struggle i watched my opportunity and with my
sword severed the flag from its staff at this moment the
trumpets the king sounded a retreat i had received
two severe wounds one in the shoulder and the other in
the thigh in the contest i felt myself faint with the loss
 blood a french officer a rude appearance and gigantic
stature accosting me with the appellation boy
commanded me to surrender the standard to him i refused
and to convince him i was in earnest proceeded
to wrap it round my body and fastened it under my arm
soon after i became insensible and in this situation was
accidentally found by my uncle and his companions who
immediately took me and my prize under their care as
soon as i was a little recovered my wounds the king
seized an opportunity after having bestowed loud commendations
upon my gallantry conferring the honours
 knighthood upon me in the face the whole army
while our tents were pitched under the walls pavia
i was continually extending the circle my acquaintance
among the young gentry france who like myself had
attended their sovereign in this memorable expedition i
had some enemies made such by the distinctions i obtained
during the siege but they were few the greater
part courted me the more the more i showed myself worthy
a v q i
travels st leon
 their attachment envy is not a passion that finds easy
root in a frenchman's bosom i was one the youngest
 those who attended on the siege but my brothers in
arms were generous rivals who in the field obstinately
strove with me for superior glory but over the convivial
board forgot their mutual competitions and opened their
hearts to benevolence and friendship let us not was
a sentiment i heard often repeated forget the object that
led us from our pleasant homes to pour from the heights
 the alps upon the fields italy it is to humble the
imperious spaniard to punish the disloyal bourbon to
vindicate the honour our beloved and illustrious monarch
those walls cover the enemy yonder mountains serve to
hide them from our assault let no frenchman mistake
him who marches under the same standard for an adversary

the trenches had not been opened before pavia till about
the beginning november the winter overtook us and
the siege was yet in progress with some apparent advantage
indeed to our side the question but by no means
promising an instant conclusion the season set in with
unusual severity and both officer and soldier were glad
as much as possible to fence out its rigour by the indulgences
 the genial board my finances as i have said
were at the commencement the expedition in excellent
order i had brought with me a considerable sum and it
was not spared upon the present occasion
there were however other things to be attended to beside
the demands conviviality the king became impatient
 the delays the siege the garrison and the
inhabitants were reduced to great extremities but the governor
discovered no symptoms a purpose to surrender
in the mean time intelligence was brought that bourbon
was making the most extraordinary exertions in germany
and promised to lead to the enemy a reinforcement 
twelve thousand men from that country while the imperial
generals by mortgaging their revenues and pawning their
jewels and still more by their eloquence and influence with
those under their command were able to keep together the
remains a disheartened and defeated army in expectation

 his arrival there was some danger therefore i

ultimately be obliged to raise it with ignominy or to fight
the enemy under every disadvantage francis however
was not to be deterred from his undertaking he swore a
solemn oath that pavia should be his or he would perish
in the attempt
thus circumstanced he conceived a very extraordinary
project pavia is defended on one side by the tesino the
scene the first the four famous battles by which hannibal
signalised his invasion italy the king believed
that if this river could by the labour his army be diverted
from its course the town must instantly fall into his hands
he was encouraged to the undertaking by recollecting a
stratagem a similar nature by which cyrus formerly
made himself master the city babylon it was a
thought highly flattering to the grandeur his soul to
imagine that posterity would in this instance institute a
parallel between him and cyrus the great
the plan for diverting the course the tesino produced
a new and extraordinary scene it was as may well
be believed a work uncommon labour a new channel
was to be scooped out and deepened and while the stream
was turned into this channel piles were to be sunk and an
immense mound earth created as an effectual impediment
to the waters resuming their former course this
was a heavy burthen to the soldier in addition to the disadvantage
 being encamped during the course a winter
remarkably severe for the climate in which we fought by
any other army the task would have been performed with
cloudiness and discontent if not complained with repining
and murmurs but here the gaiety the french
character displayed itself the nobility france who
attended their sovereign in great numbers accompanied the
infantry in their labour we laid aside the indulgence 
the marquee tapestry and carpets we threw off our
upper garments and each seized a spade a barrow earth
or a mattock we put our hands to the engines and refused
no effort under pretence that it was sordid or severe
while the trees were leafless and nature appeared bound

up in frost sweat ran down our faces and bedewed our
limbs the army were encouraged by our example an
employment which under other circumstances would have
been regarded as rigid was thus made a source new
hilarity and amusement it was a memorable sight to behold
the venerable and greyheaded leaders the french
army endeavouring to exert the strength and activity 
their early years to me who had but lately arrived at
the stature manhood and who was accustomed to all the
exercises which give strength and vigour to the frame this
new employment was in no degree burdensome i felt in
it the satisfaction that a swift man experiences when he
enters the lists the race i congratulated myself upon
the nature my education if it be a sin to covet honour
that guilt was mine and so great was my appetite for it
that i was inexpressibly rejoiced to observe the various
ways in which it might be gratified
strange as it may seem this scene a wintercamp in the
midst blood and sweat surrounded with dangers and called
on for unparalleled exertions appears to me through the vista
 years that is now interposed between to have been one 
the happiest my life the gay labours and surprises 
the day were succeeded by a convivial evening in which
we did not the less open our hearts though frequently
liable to be interrupted in our midnight revels by the inexhaustible
activity and stratagems the enemy in this
various and evershifting scene i forgot the disasters that
occurred and the blood that flowed around me all sense
 a large and impartial morality was for the time at least
deadened in my breast i was ever upon the alert the
diversity events neither suffered my spirits to flag nor
reflection to awake it is only upon such occasions or
occasions like these that a man is able fully to feel what life
is and to revel in its exuberance above all i was delighted
with the society and friendship my brotherofficers
they honoured me they loved me i seemed to feel what
sympathy was and to have conscious pleasure in making
one in a race beings like myself such were my sensations

 travels st leon
it must not however be imagined that all about me
felt in these respects as i did i was deeply indebted in
this particular to my youth and my fortune the old endeavoured
to brace themselves in vain they sunk under
the continual pressure the poor soldier from the ranks
laboured incessantly and i laboured as much as he but
he had little opportunity to recruit his vigour and renovate
his strength there was yet another class persons in the
camp whose gaiety was much less interrupted than mine
these were the king and the generals who commanded
under him they could not be entirely devoid thought
and consideration they suffered much anxiety from the
length the siege and felt that every period delay
increased the doubtfulness the event
antonio de leyva governor the city necessarily felt
himself alarmed at the extraordinary project in which we
were engaged and made every exertion to prevent it one
evening the king sent for me to his tent and told me in
confidence that the enemy intended that very night to make
three several attacks upon our mound one on each side 
the stream and one by means boats in the centre two
 these he said were merely intended as feints the west
bank the tesino was the point against which their principal
exertions would be directed on that side he was
resolved to command in person the boats with which he
proposed to resist their flota he confided to one the most
famous and valuable officers his army the detachment
on the east bank he purposed to intrust to my uncle and
myself he observed that the detachment he could spare
for that purpose after having formed the other two bodies
and reserved a sufficient number for the defence the
camp and the works would be small and he warned me
to the exertion a particular vigilance it would be
doubly unfortunate if a body the attack upon which was
to be merely a feigned one should nevertheless be routed

answerably to the merit your first achievement and
depend upon it that you will prove hereafter one the

travels st leon
the marquis de villeroy divided our little force into
two bodies with the larger he lay in wait for the enemy
near the scene the expected attack the smaller he confided
to my direction and placed so that we might be able
to fall upon the rear the garrisontroops as soon as they
should be fully engaged with our comrades in the situation
assigned me i took advantage the skirts a
wood which enabled me to approach very near to the expected
route our assailants without being perceived by
them the night was extremely dark yet the vicinity 
my position was such that i could count the numbers 
the adversary as they passed along before my hidingplace
i was alarmed to find that they amounted to at least the
triple what we had been taught to expect they were
no sooner past than i despatched to the king a young
knight my particular friend who happened to be with me
to urge the necessity a reinforcement at the same time
i sent a messenger to my uncle by a circuitous route to
inform him what i had observed and the step i had
taken and to entreat him to defer the attack as long as consistently
with propriety it should be possible the enemy
however had no sooner arrived at the place his destination
than the troops the marquis no longer capable 
restraint rushed to engage the spaniards were at first surprised
but a short time led them to suspect the weakness
 their assailants nor was the assistance i brought to my
uncle sufficient to turn the fortune the fight we lost
many our men the rest apparently gave ground and
it was a vain attempt amidst the darkness the night to
endeavour to restore order and rally them to the assault
we were already almost completely overpowered when
the succours we expected reached us they were however
unable to distinguish friend from enemy a storm 
mingled rain and snow had come on which benumbed our
limbs drove fiercely in our faces and rendered every object
alike viewless the carnage which in this situation took
place was terrible our blows were struck at random a
frenchman was not less dreadful than a spaniard when
the battle ceased scarcely one the enemy was left alive 
but we observed with astonishment and horror the number
c 
 travels op st leon
 the besiegers who had probably in the midst the confusion
been cut to pieces by their own countrymen
i anl now arrived at the period which put an to the
festivity and jocundness the campaign all after this
was one continued series disaster about the close 
january our work though not wholly interrupted was considerably
retarded by a succession heavy rains this
was injurious to us in many ways our project which was
executed in the midst waters rendered additional damp
a matter serious consideration we were also seized
with an apprehension still greater magnitude which was
speedily realised the snows being at length completely
dissolved and the quantity water continually increasing
we perceived one afternoon strong symptoms that our
mound the principal subject our labour and source 
our hope was giving way in various places the next
morning at daybreak it rushed down every where at once
with wonderful violence and noise it is difficult to describe
the sensation anguish which was instantly and
universally diffused the labour many weeks was overthrown
in a moment as we had proceeded in our work
we every day saw ourselves nearer the object to which we
aspired at this time our project was almost completed and
pavia was in imagination already in our hands to gain
possession which had cost us such unremitted exertions
the display so much gallantry and the loss so many
soldiers we were confounded at the catastrophe we saw
we gazed at each other each in want encouragement
and every one unable to afford it
still however we were not destitute advantages the
garrison began to be in want both ammunition and provisions
they were in a general state discontent almost
 mutiny which scarcely all the address and authority 
the governor were able to suppress if the town continued
longer unrelieved it was sure to fall into our hands but
even this our last hope was considerably diminished by the
intelligence we received the very day after the destruction
 our mound that the imperial army after having received
large reinforcements was approaching in considerable force
the king had some time before in the height his contravels
 st leon 
licence and elation his heart sent off a detachment 
six thousand men to invade the kingdom naples for
upon that as well as the milanese he had inherited pretensions
from his immediate predecessors
but though the enemy was superior in numbers and a
part perhaps their forces better disciplined than ours
they laboured under several disadvantages to which we were
not exposed the emperor though his dominions were
more extensive did not derive from them a revenue equal
to that francis as he did not take the field in person
the war appeared to his subjects only a common war proceeding
upon the ordinary motives war but my countrymen
were led by their sovereign were fresh from the
recent insolence an invasion their own territory and
fought at once for personal glory and their country's honour
the king who commanded them seemed expressly formed
to obtain their attachment and affection his nobles became
enthusiastic by the example his enthusiasm and willingly
disbursed their revenues to give prosperity and eclat to the
campaign
the first question that arose upon the approach the
enemy was whether we should break up the siege and
attend in some strong post the slow but sure effect their
want money and the consequent dispersion their
troops or wait their attack in our present posture the
former advice was safe but to the gallant spirit francis
it appeared ignominious he was upon all occasions the
partisan rapid measures and decisive proceedings and
his temper with the exception a few wary and deliberate
counsellors accorded with that our whole army for
some days we congratulated ourselves upon the wisdom 
our choice we presented to the enemy so formidable an
appearance that notwithstanding the cogent motives he
had to proceed he hesitated long before he ventured to
attack us at length however the day came that was
pregnant with so momentous expectation
if through the whole limits our camp there was nota
man that did not feel himself roused upon this glorious
occasion to me it was especially interesting the scene
accorded with the whole purpose my education and
c 
 travels op st leon
novelty made it impressive i lived only in the present
moment i had not a thought a wish a straggling imagination
that wandered beyond the circuit the day my
soul was filled at one minute wild with expectation and
at another awed into solemnity there is something indescribably
delicious in this concentration the mind it
raises a man above himself and makes him feel a certain
nobleness and elevation character the possession 
which he was to that hour unconscious fear and pain
were ideas that could find no harbour in my bosom i regarded
this as the most memorable days and myself as
the most fortunate mortals far indeed was i from anticipating
the disgraceful event in which this elation 
heart speedily terminated
the sun rose bright in a cloudless sky the cold the
season was such as only to give new lightness and elasticity
to the muscles and animal spirits i saw few those
objects nature which in this delightful climate gave so
sacred a pleasure to the human soul but in my present
temper there was no object sight so ravishing as the firm
and equal steps the martial bands the impatience the
warhorse and the display military standards nor any
music so enchanting as the shrillness the pipe the
clangor the trumpet the neighing steeds and the
roaring cannon it is thus that man disguises to himself
the real nature his occupation and clothes that which
is all things the most nefarious or most to be lamented
with the semblance jubilee and festival
the imperialists were at first unable to withstand the
efforts french valour they gave way on every side 
we pursued our advantage with impetuosity to the
slaughter whole ranks mowed down with tremendous
celerity to the agonies the dying i was blind their
groans had no effect on my organ for my soul was occupied
in another direction my horse's heels spurned their
mangled limbs and were red with their blood i fought
not merely with valour but with fury i animated those
around me by my example and my acclamations it may
seem contrary to delicacy to speak with this freedom my
own praises but i am at my present writing totally changed
travels st leon 
and removed from what i was and i write with the freedom
 a general historian it is this simplicity and ingenuousness
that shall pervade the whole my narrative
the fortune the day speedily changed the cowardice
and desertion our swiss allies gave the first signal
 adversity the gallant commander the garrison 
pavia sallied out in the midst the fight and suddenly
attacked us in the rear a stratagem the imperial general
effected the rout our cavalry the whole face the
field was utterly reversed
it would be in vain for me to attempt to describe even
the small part that i beheld the calamity and slaughter
 the french army at this distance time the recollection
 it opens afresh the almost obliterated wounds 
my heart i saw my friends cut down and perish on
every side those who together with myself had marched
out in the morning swelled with exultation and hope now
lay weltering in their blood their desires their thoughts
their existence were brought to a fatal termination the
common soldiers were hewed and cut to pieces by hundreds
without note and observation many the first nobility
 france made desperate by the change the battle
rushed into the thickest the foe and became so many
voluntary sacrifices choosing rather to perish than to turn
their backs with dishonour
in the battle i had two horses killed under me the
first them suffered a sort gradual destruction he had
already received one wound in the nostrils and another in
the neck when a third shot carried away two his feet
and laid him prostrate on the earth bernardin my
faithful attendant observed what was passing and immediately
brought me a fresh charger but i had not long
mounted him when he received a wound which killed him
on the spot i was myself hurt in several places and at
length the stroke a sabre brought me to the ground
here i remained for a long time insensible when i recovered
and looked around me i found myself in entire
solitude and could at present perceive no trace either the
enemy or my own people soon however i recollected
what had passed and was but too well assured the
c 
 travels op st leon
defeat my countrymen had sustained weak and battered
as i was i attempted to retire to a place greater security
i had scarcely changed my ground before i saw a
trooper the enemy rushing towards me with the intention
to take away my life fortunately i observed a tree
at hand to the shelter which i hastened and partly by
moving the branches to and fro and partly by shifting my
position i baffled my adversary till he became weary 
the attempt a moment after i saw one my most intimate
and familiar companions killed before my eyes it
was not long however before a party fugitive french
came up to the spot where i stood and i like the rest was
hurried from the field my uncle perished in the battle
it is wonderful how men can harden their hearts against
such scenes as i then witnessed it is wonderful how
they can be brought to cooperate in such demoniac fury
and more than demoniac mischief barbarity and murder
but they are brought to it and enter not from a deplorable
necessity but as to a festival in which each man is eager
to occupy his place and share the amusements it seemed
to me at that time as it seems to me now that it should
be enough for a man to contemplate such a field as i saw
at pavia to induce him to abjure the trade violence forever
and to commit his sword once more to the bowels
 the earth from which it was torn for so nefarious a
purpose
these sensations though now finally established in my
mind were at the time which i am writing but fleeting
duration the force education and the first bent
 my mind were too strong the horror which overwhelmed
me in the first moments this great national
defeat subsided and the military passion returned upon mein
its original ardour my convictions and the moral integrity
 my soul were temporary and i became myself
a monument that inconstancy and that wonder to which
i have just alluded
various circumstances however prevented this passion
from its direct operation the character france was
altered by the battle pavia though mine remained the
same it was in the fullest degree decisive the fortune
travels st leon 
 the war milan and every other place in the duchy
opened their gates to the conqueror j and in a fortnight
not a frenchman was left in the fields italy the
whole army only a small body effected an orderly retreat
under the command the duke glencoe many persons
 the highest distinction perished in the battle many
were made prisoners hy the enemy france by this event
found the list her noblesse considerably reduced in numbers
 add to which those whose loss she sustained were
almost all them taken from among the most distinguished
and meritorious in the catalogue
but what constituted the principal feature in this memorable
event was that the king himself was found in the
number the prisoners nor was he released by his ungenerous
competitor till after more than a twelvemonth's
confinement during this period francis tasted the
dregs adversity inclined in the first instance to judge
 his rival by himself he expected a liberal treatment in
this he was deeply disappointed after a detention 
many months in the milanese the scene his former successes
he was transferred to madrid he was personally
neglected by the emperor while his disloyal subject was
treated with singular distinction the most rigorous terms
were proposed to him all this had the effect in one instance
 sinking him into a disease languor and dejection
which he was not expected to survive and in another
 inducing him to execute an instrument by which he abdicated
the crown and declared his resolution remaining
a prisoner for life his confinement was at length terminated
by his solemnly engaging to compulsory articles which
he was determined to break as soon as he found himself at
liberty an alternative peculiarly grating to the liberality
 his spirit this reverse fortune materially changed his
character the fine spirit his ambition was from this
time evaporated and while he still retained the indefeasible
qualities his soul and was gallant kindhearted and
generous he bartered as far as was compatible with his
disposition the enterprising and audacious temper he had
previously manifested for the wary and phlegmatic system
the constable bourbon

 his more fortunate competitor his genius cowered before
that charles and the defeat pavia may perhaps
be considered as having given a deadly wound to the reign
 chivalry and a secure foundation to that craft dissimulation

chapter iii
the lists military ambition then being closed if not
permanently at least for a time my mind took a new bias 
and without dismissing its most cherished and darling passion
pursued a path in the present emergency to which
the accidents my youth had also guided me if my
mother had survived she would probably either not have consented
to my serving at the siege pavia or at least would
have recalled me to the obscurity my paternal chateau
as soon as the campaign was at an i had not fully
completed the twentieth year my age at the period the
memorable battle in which my sovereign was made prisoner
i was left without adviser or guide even the marquis de
villeroy my mother's brother whatever consequence his
admonitions to me might have proved was taken from mein
this fatal engagement the king himself perhaps had
it not been for the dreadful calamities in which he was now
involved might have condescended to interest himself in
some degree in my welfare by the course events i
was left yet a minor and with an ample revenue at my
disposition to be wholly guided by the suggestions my
own mind
in the portion his reign already elapsed the splendid
and interesting qualities francis had given a new spring
to the sentiments the nation he was the most accomplished
and amiable prince the time in which he lived
there was but one all the sovereigns christendom that
could cope with him in power the emperor charles and
as charles's peculiarities were a sort that frenchmen
were accustomed to regard with aversion and contempt so
travels st leon 
there had not been a doubt among my compatriots the
side upon which the superiority would ultimately rest by
the events the day pavia they were confounded and
overwhelmed they did not despair their country they
soon felt and felt to its utmost extent the rank which
france held among the european states but the chain 
their ideas was interrupted they could not but be conscious
that the fortune the kingdom had received a grievous
check the illustrious career which they had in fancy
already traversed was postponed to a distant period
the consequences which flow from a suppressed ambition
may easily be imagined the nobility france exchanged
the activity the field for the indulgences the table 
that concentrated spirit which had sought to expand itself
upon the widest stage now found vent in the exhibition 
individual expense and above all the sordid and inglorious
passion for gaming a vice eminently characteristic the
age now especially gained strength and drew multitudes
into its destructive vortex it was perhaps impossible fora
young man to have entered the theatre the world under
less favourable auspices
in what i have already written i felt myself prompted
to enlarge with complacency upon the sentiments and scenes
 my youth and i have yielded to the suggestion the
same internal admonition makes me shrink from entering
with minuteness into the detail my ruin i recollect my
infatuation with abhorrence i fly from the memory with
sensations inexpressibly painful i regard it as a cloud that
overshadowed and blackened for ever the fair prospects 
my earlier years
i shall not enumerate all my youthful companions or all
my youthful follies i committed a mistake obvious enough
at this immature period my existence when i mistook
profusion and extravagance for splendour and dignity and
the prudent economy which my mother had practised served
in the present instance as the pander to my vices the
whole tendency my education had been to inspire me
with a proud and restless desire distinction and i was
not content to play a second part in the career my vices
as i should not have been content to play a second part in
 travels st leon
the genuine theatre honour and fame in all that was
thoughtlessly spirited and gaily profligate i led the way to
my compeers and was constantly held up by them as an
example by this conduct i incurred the censure the
rigorous and the old but the voice censure reached me
much seldom than that adulation my person and
demeanour were the topics general applause i was tall
and wellproportioned my frame was slender and agile
but with an appearance the fullest health my countenance
was open commanding and animated my rank and
situation in the world gave me confidence the fire and
impetuosity my temper rendered my gestures easy rapid
expressive and graceful the consequence all this was
to confirm me in a plan life which i early laid down to
myself and from which i never in any instance deviated
i put aside those rules as splenetic and hypercritical which
confessors preach and with which the preceptors young
men are accustomed to weary and alienate the minds 
their pupils the charge being disorderly and unthinking
i despised that imprudence even when meant for
blame sounded in my ear like the voice encomium but
accustomed from education to sentiments honour and
from habit to the language eulogy it is difficult for any
man to be more firmly bent than i was to incur no breath
 dishonour or to draw the line more peremptorily between
the follies youth and the aberrations a gross
and unprincipled spirit
it may be alleged indeed and with considerable justice
that the habit gaming is an exception to this statement
it was with hesitation and reluctance that i entered into
this habit i saw it as it was and as every ingenuous and
debauched mind must see it base and sordid the possession
 some degree wealth i regarded indeed as indispensable
to a man who would fill a lofty and respectable
character in the world a character that by uniting the
advantages exterior appearance with the actions a hero
should extort the homage his species but in the picture
i drew this man in my mind i considered wealth
as an accident the attendant on his birth to be dispensed
with dignity not to be adverted to with minuteness attravels
 st leon 
mention deep play is certainly sufficiently inconsistent with
this character the direct purpose the gamester is to
transfer money from the pocket his neighbour into his
own he rouses his sleepy and wearied attention by the
most sordid all motives the fear losing pierces his
heart with anguish and to gain to obtain an advantage
for himself which can scarcely exceed and which seldom
equals the injury his competitor suffers is the circumstance
which most transports his heart with delight for this he
watches for this he calculates an honourable gamester
does not seize with premeditation the moment when his
adversary is deprived by wine or any other cause his
usual selfpossession he does not seek with sober malice
to play upon his passions he does not enter with avidity
into the contest with an unpractised but presuming rival 
but he cannot avoid rejoicing when he finds that accident
has given him an unusual advantage i have often thought
that i could better understand how a man honour could
reconcile himself to the accursed and murderous trade 
war than to the system the gaming table in war he
fights with a stranger a man with whom he has no habits
 kindness and who is fairly apprised that he comes against
him with ruinous intent but in play he robs perhaps
his brother his friend the partner his bosom j or in
every event a man seduced into the snare with all the
arts courtesy and whom he smiles upon even while he
i am talking here the mere reason and common sense 
the question as it relates to mankind in general but it is
with other feelings that i reflect upon the concern i have
myself individually in the subject years roll on in vain 
ages themselves are useless here looking forward as i do
to an existence that shall endure till time shall be no more 
no time can wipe away the remembrance the bitter
anguish that i have endured the consequence gaming
it is torture it is madness poverty i have drained thy
cup to the dregs i have seen my wife and my children
looking to me in vain for bread which is the most intolerable
distress that the period in which all the comforts
 life gradually left me in which i caught at every
 travels st leon
fragment promise and every fragment failed in which
i rose every morning to pamper myself with empty delusions
 in which i ate the apples purgatory fair without
but within bitterness and ashes in which i tossed through
endless sightless nights upon the couch disappointment
and despair or the period when at length all my hopes
were at an when i fled with horror to a foreign
climate when my family that should have been my comfort
gave me my most poignant agony when i looked
upon them naked destitute and exiles with the tremendous
thought what and who it was that had caused their
ruin adversity without consolation adversity when its
sting is remorse selfabhorrence and selfcontempt hell
has no misery by which it can be thrown into shade or
exceeded 
why do i dwell upon or at least why do i anticipate
this detested circumstance my story let me add one
remark in this place and pass on to the other particulars
 this epoch my prodigality it is true i must take
this shameful appellation to myself i was a gamester
but in the beginning i took no concern in that species 
science which is often implied in the appellation my
games were games hazard not skill it appeared to
my distempered apprehension to be only a mode in which
for a man to display his fortitude and philosophy i was
flattered with the practice gaming because saw in it
when gracefully pursued the magnanimity the stoic
combined with the manners a man the world a magnanimity
that no success is able to intoxicate and no vicissitude
to subvert i committed my property to the hazard
 the die and i placed my ambition in laughing alike at
the favours fortune and her frowns in the sequel
however i found myself deceived the fickle goddess
sufficiently proved that she had the power making me
serious but in her most tremendous reverses i was never
influenced to do any thing that the most scrupulous gamester
regards as dishonourable i say not this for the purpose
 giving colour and speciousness to my tale i say
it because i have laid it down to myself in this narrative
as a sacred principle to relate the simple unaltered truth
travels st leon 
another characteristic the reign francis the first
is its gallantries it is well known how much the king was
himself occupied with attachments this sort his government
was rather the government women than politicians
 and the manners the sovereign strongly tended to
fix the habits his subjects a very young man rather
takes the tone his passions from those about him than
forms one that is properly his own and this was my casein
the present instance as well as in the preceding originally
 an amorous constitution i should perhaps have
quieted the restlessness my appetites without ostentation
and eclat had not the conduct my youthful associates in
general led me to regard gallantry as an accomplishment
indispensably necessary in a young man rank it must
be confessed indeed that this offence against the rigour 
discipline has a thousand advantages over that gaming
few women regular and reputable lives have that ease 
manners that flow fancy and that graceful intrepidity
 thinking and expressing themselves that is sometimes to
be found among those who have discharged themselves from
the tyranny custom there is something irresistibly
captivating in that voluptuousness which while it assumes
a certain air freedom uniformly and with preference
conforms itself to the dictates unsophisticated delicacy
a judicious and limited voluptuousness is necessary to the
cultivation the mind to the polishing the manners to
the refining sentiment and the development the understanding
 and a woman deficient in this respect may be
 use for the government our families but can neither
add to the enjoyments nor fix the partiality a man 
animation and taste
but whatever there may be in these considerations certain
it is that the conduct i pursued in matters gallantry
led me into great and serious expenses the mistresses
with whom i chanced to associate had neither the inexpressible
captivation madame de chateaubriand nor the
aspiring and impressive manners the duchess d'etampes
they had however beauty and vivacity frolic without
rudeness and softness without timidity they had paid
mistresses francis l
s travels st leon
some regard to points knowledge and taste considering
these as additional means for fixing the partiality their
paramour and knowing that they had no security for the
permanence their prosperity but in the variety their
attractions in their society i was led into new trains
 reflection a nicer consideration human passion and
the varieties human character and above all into a
greater quickness and delicacy in matters intellectual taste
my hours for the most part rolled swiftly and easily away
sometimes in the society the young the gay and the ambitious
 my own sex and sometimes in the softer and
more delicious intercourse the fair i lived in the midst
 all that paris could at that time furnish splendid and
luxurious this system living was calculated to lull
me in pleasing dreams and to waste away existence in delirious
softness it sufficiently accorded with the sad
period our sovereign's captivity when my young compatriots
sought to drown the sense public and patriotic
considerations in copious draughts pleasure nor did the
monarch's return immediately restore to france her former
haughtiness and pride
the course sensuality in which i was now engaged
though it did not absolutely sink into grossness may
well be supposed to have trodden upon the very edge 
licence i and my companions were young we were made
fearless and presuming by fortune and by rank we had
laid aside those more rigorous restraints which render the
soberer part mankind plausible and decent by making
them timid and trite i will not contaminate the minds 
my innocent and inexperienced readers by entering into the
detail the follies in which i engaged
one thing it is necessary to remark as essential to the
main thread my story my expenses all kinds during
this period selfdesertion drained my resources but did
not tarnish my good name my excesses were regarded by
some as ornamental and becoming but by all were admitted
as venial the laurels i had won in the field military
honour were not obscured by my subsequent conduct i
was universally ranked among the most promising and
honourable the young noblemen france i had some
travels st leon
rivals i did not pass through this turbulent and diversified
scene without disputes hut no one cast a reflection
upon my name no one ventured to speak me with superciliousness
and opprobrium nor was my temper more injured
than my reputation from every dispute i extricated
myself with grace and propriety i studied the pleasure and
ease all with whom i associated and no man enjoyed
more extensively than i did the sweets friendship as far
as the sweets friendship can be extensively enjoyed
chapter iv
i had been now two years in habits life and a mode 
expense extremely injurious to my patrimony when a circumstance
occurred which promised completely to deliver
me from the ruinous consequences my own folly this
was no other than my encounter with that incomparable
woman who afterwards became the partner my life and
the mother my children i cannot even now recollect
her without tears the sentiment which her very name excites
in my mind is a mingled feeling on the one hand 
the most exquisite and unspeakable delight a feeling that
elevates and expands and electrifies my throbbing heart 
and on the other the bitterest anguish and regret i
must developed the source this feeling
marguerite louise isabel de damville was at the period
 our first meeting in the nineteenth year her age
her complexion was the most perfect transparency her
eyes black and sparkling and her eyebrows dark and long
such were the perfect smoothness and clearness her skin
that at nineteen she appeared five years younger than she was
and she long retained this extreme juvenility form her step
was airy and light as that a young fawn yet at the same
time firm and indicative strength body and vigour 
mind her voice like the whole her external appearance
was expressive undesigning i had almost said
childish simplicity yet with all this playfulness 
travels st leon
appearance her understanding was bold and correct her
mind was well furnished with every thing that could add
to her accomplishments as a wife or a mother her indulgent
parents had procured her every advantage education
and circumstances had been uncommonly favourable
to her improvement she was encouraged and assisted in
the art drawing for which she discovered a very early
talent by leonardo da vinci j and she formed her poetical
taste from the conversation and instructions clement
mart but amidst the singular assemblage her intellectual
accomplishments there was nothing by which she
was so much distinguished as the uncommon prudence 
her judgments and the unalterable amiableness her
manners this was the woman destined to crown my happiness
and consummate my misery if i had never
known her i should never have tasted true pleasure if i
had been guided by her counsels i should not have drained
to the very dregs the cup anguish
the house her father the marquis de damville was
the resort all the most eminent wits and scholars that
period particularly mart rabelais erasmus and scaliger
this was my first inducement to frequent it my
education had inspired me with an inextinguishable love 
literature and the dissipation in which i was at this time
involved could not entirely interrupt the propensity the
most thoughtless and extravagant period my life had occasional
intervals study and reflection and the gay
animated and ingenious conversation the men i have
mentioned had always peculiar charms for me
i had continued for some time to visit at the marquis's
hotel before i encountered the beautiful marguerite the
first time i saw her she made a deep impression upon me
the marquis who was one the most benevolent and
enlightened mankind had been led by my character and
manners to conceive a warm friendship for me he saw
the ruin in which i was heedlessly involving myself and
believed that it was not yet too late to save me as he
thought that there was no method so likely to effect my
reformation as the interposition domestic affections he
was not unwilling to encourage the attachment i began to
travels op st leon 
feel for his daughter on my part i wanted but little
encouragement i no sooner observed her manners and
became acquainted with her merits than my heart was unalterably
fixed i became as it were a new man i was
like one who after his eyes had grown imperceptibly dim
till at length every object appeared indistinct and a
gloomy general hue has his sight instantaneously restored
and beholds the fabric the universe in its genuine clearness
brilliancy and truth i was astonished at my own
folly that i could so long have found gratification in pleasures
mean and sensual i was ashamed my own degradation
i could not endure the comparison between the
showy unsubstantial attractions the women i had hitherto
frequented and the charms the adorable marguerite the
purity her mind seemed to give a celestial brilliancy and
softness to the beauties her person the gross and brutal
pursuits the debauchee are often indeed described by the
same epithets as the virtuous and refined passion with which
i was now for the first time inspired but experience convinced
me that they differed in their most essential features
the marquis saw the state my mind and addressed
me thus lc count said he i feel the most ardent
friendship for you i am inexpressibly concerned for your
welfare you will be convinced this when i have furnished
you with a clue to my late conduct towards you i
regard you if not as a ruined man at least as a man in the
high road to ruin your present habits are the most
dangerous sort they appear to you perfectly conformable
to principles the strictest honour nay they come recommended
to you by a certain eclat and dignity with
which they seem to be surrounded i could say to you
recollect yourself be not misled by delusive appearances
consider the present state your fortune and the state in
which your mother left it you cannot be ignorant how
greatly it is impaired how has this circumstance arisen
have your revenues been expended in the service your
country have you purchased any thing by them that will
confer on you lasting renown put together the sum 
actions which piece by piece you have been willing to
regard as indifferent and innocent if not as graceful and
d 
 travels st leon
becoming you cannot but be struck with their monstrous
deformity is it possible that you can be ignorant the
nature poverty there is such a thing as honourable
poverty the poverty cincinnatus was honourable who
impoverished himself by paying the fine which was factiously
imposed on his son and then was contented to pass
his time alternately between the highest situations and the
most rigid simplicity the poverty a man genius
such as rabelais if not honourable is interesting when we
compare his merits and worth with that many those
persons upon whom fortune has blindly lavished her favours
it is honourable if he have declined the means 
enriching himself by the sacrifice his independence and
his principles but all earthly things the most contemptible
is the man who having wasted his goods in
riotous living yet hungers after the luxuries that have
proved his bane and feasts himself upon the steam 
dainties which he has lost the substance poverty
always sufficiently disadvantageous in a degenerate age
where attention and courtship are doled forth with scales
 gold is tremendous to him he is the scorn all mankind
wherever he is a guest he is invited only to be
trampled upon and insulted he is capable nothing
and is a burden to society and mankind the helplessness
 age advances upon him with stealing steps and he
is destined to gather all its miseries and none its consolations

i might have talked to you thus but i refused it i
apprehend something the nature advice i know that
it can seldom be attended with its genuine effect and will
never be received with deference and pleasure where its
motives are capable misconstruction if i had talked to
you thus i might have appeared to be indulging the tyranny
 age i might have seemed to assume an unbecoming
air superiority and command it could not have
been clear that i was honestly interested in that about
which i affected so much concern i doubt not the ingenuousness
 your nature i doubt not that you would
have been struck with the picture but i must be permitted
to doubt the adequate and lasting effect my extravels
 st leon j
population i was not willing by my forwardness and
loquacity to wear out one the great springs human
improvement
i have determined on your reform for that purpose i
think it necessary to combine my remonstrances and advice
with a change your habits and situation you have
tasted largely what are commonly called the pleasures 
life but there are pleasures that you have not tasted at
this moment you anticipate them and anticipate them
with the ardour a lover but you know not yet all the
gratifications that attend upon domestic affections
i am willing to bestow upon you my daughter i consent
to prove the purity my advice and the sincerity 
my regard by committing her happiness to the risk she
is a treasure the equal which perhaps the world does not
hold i speak not her personal attractions but in understanding
accomplishments and virtue i firmly believe
no woman living can compare with her in possessing her
you will be blessed beyond the lot princes but at the
same time that i shah thus put happiness within your grasp
remember that i commit to your disposal the happiness 
marguerite you are a worthy and an honourable man 
your talents and your virtues will constitute her felicity
her portion will redeem the injury which your patrimony
has suffered from your excesses and you will have enough
for yourselves and for your mutual offspring i cannot
believe that with such a deposit intrusted to you you will
consent to bring her to misery and ruin
c i have one condition however to stipulate with you
i require you as the pledge her happiness that you
break off your present modes life that you separate
yourself from your connections and retire into the country
upon your paternal estate you are yet too young to be in
danger from that tyranny custom which often renders
men more advanced in life incapable relishing the simple
and genuine pleasures you will find contentment and
joy in the society my daughter and in the bosom 
your rising family you will be happy in the circle 
your own hearth and have little to ask the rest mankind
if in any illomened and inauspicious moment the
d 
 travels st leon
allurements your present vices forgive the plainness 
my speech should resume their power over you i hope at
least that i shall never live to see it that i shall not be
taught by bitter experience that i have sacrificed to the
disinterestedness my friendship the happiness my
daughter and my posterity 
my heart weeps blood while i record the admonitions 
this noble and generous man a nobler france did not
contain through all her boundaries refined by literature
polished by the best society his age could afford grown
grey in the field honour and particularly distinguished
by the personal attachment and confidence his sovereign
what was all this advice to me what return did i make
to this unparalleled kindness and friendship i ruined this
admirable woman i involved her in poverty and shame 
with the most savage barbarity i prepared for her an immature
grave can i forget this what avail to me are
immortal life and immortal youth oh marguerite marguerite
 for ever thy image haunts me for ever thy
ghost upbraids me how little have i proved myself worthy
 such a partner rather what punishment what plagues
what shame and detestation have i not deserved praised
be heaven the last prayer the marquis damville at
least was granted he did not live to witness my relapse
my profligacy and insanity
i resume the thread my story i listened to the address
 the marquis with reverence and admiration i
accepted his conditions with joy i married his adorable
daughter and conducted her to my paternal estate in the
bourgeois now only it was that i tasted perfect happiness
to judge from my own experience in this situation
i should say that nature has atoned for all the disasters
and miseries she so copiously and incessantly pours upon
her sons by this one gift the transcendent enjoyment and
nameless delights which wherever the heart is pure and
the soul is refined wait on the attachment two persons
 opposite sexes my beloved marguerite guided and
directed me at the same time that she was ever studying
my gratification i instructed her by my experience while
she enlightened me by the rectitude and decision her
travels st leon s
taste ours was a sober and dignified happiness and its
very sobriety served to give it additional voluptuousness
we had each our separate pursuits whether for the cultivation
 our minds or the promotion our mutual interests
separation gave us respectability in each other's
eyes while it prepared us to enter with fresh ardour into
society and conversation in company with each other
hours passed over us and appeared but minutes it has
been said to be a peculiar felicity for any one to be praised
by a man who is himself eminently a subject praise 
how much happier to be prized and loved by a person
worthy love a man may be prized and valued by his
friend but in how different a style sentiment from the
regard and attachment that may reign in the bosom his
mistress or his wife selfcomplacency and selfsatisfaction
may perhaps be numbered among the principal sources 
contentment it is necessary for him who would endure
existence with patience that he should conceive himself to
be something that he should be persuaded he is not a
cipher in the musterroll man how bitter is the anguish
we are sometimes doomed to sustain in this respect
from the marks we receive other men's indifference and
contempt to feel that we are loved by one whose love we
have deserved to be employed in the mutual interchange 
the marks this love habitually to study the happiness
 one by whom our happiness is studied in return this is
the most desirable as it is the genuine and unadulterated
condition human nature i must have some one to
sympathise with i cannot bear to be cut off from all relations
 i desire to experience a confidence a concord an
attachment that cannot rise between common acquaintance
in every state we long for some fond bosom on which to
rest our weary head some speaking eye with which to exchange
the glances intelligence and affection then the
soul warms and expands itself then it shuns the observation
 every other beholder then it melts with feelings
that are inexpressible but that the heart understands without
the aid words then the eyes swim with rapture 
then the frame languishes with enjoyment then the soul
burns with fire then the two persons thus blest are no

longer two distance vanishes one thought animates one
mind informs them thus love acts thus it is ripened
to perfection never does man feel himself so much alive
so truly etherial as when bursting the bonds diffidence
uncertainty and reserve he pours himself entire into the
bosom the woman he adores
marguerite de damville was particularly distinguished
from every other woman i ever knew by the justness her
taste and the vividness her feelings this circumstance
was a fund inexhaustible delight and improvement tome
we were both us well acquainted with the most
eminent poets and fine writers modern times but when
we came to read them together they presented themselves
in a point view in which they had never been seen by us
before it is perhaps more important that poetry and
every thing that excites the imagination or appeals to the
heart should be read in solitude than in society but the
true way to understand our author in these cases is to employ
each these modes in succession the terrible the
majestic the voluptuous and the melting are all them
in a considerable degree affairs sympathy and we never
judge them so infallibly or with so much satisfaction
as when in the presence each other the emotion is
kindled in either bosom at the same instant the eyebeams
pregnant with sentiment and meaning involuntarily meet
and mingle the voice the reader becomes modulated by
the ideas his author and that the hearer by an accidental
interjection momentary comment or applause
confesses its accord it was in this manner that we read
together the admirable sonnets petrarch and passed in
review the sublime effusions dante the letters 
eloise to abelard afforded us singular delight we searched
into the effusions the troubadours and among all their
absurdities and inequality we found a wildness a daring
pouring forth the soul an unpruned richness imagination
and from time to time a grandeur conception and
audacious eccentricity thought that filled us with unlocked
for transport at other times when not regularly
engaged in this species reading we would repeat passages
to each other communicate the discoveries this sort that
travels op st leon 
either had made in solitude and point out unobserved beauties
that perhaps neither us would have remarked hut
for the suggestions the other it is impossible for two
persons to be constituted so much alike but that one 
them should have a more genuine and instantaneous relish
for one sort excellence and another for another thus
we added to each other's stores and acquired a largeness 
conception and liberality judgment that neither us
would have arrived at if separate it is difficult to imagine
how prolific this kind amusement proved true happiness
we were mutually delighted to remark the accord
 our feelings and still more so as we perceived that
accord to be hourly increasing and what struck either as a
blemish in the other wearing out and disappearing we
were also led by the same means to advert to the powers 
mind existing in each the rectitude judgment and delicacy
 feeling as our attachment hourly increased we
rejoiced in this reciprocation benefits while each gave or
received something that added to value mind and worth
 character mutual esteem was incessantly kept alive
and mutual esteem is the only substantial basis love
each us hourly blessed our common lot while each believed
it impracticable elsewhere to have found so much
worth blended with so much sweetness
but we did not confine ourselves to the library and fireside
we walked we rode we travelled together we observed
together the beauties nature and the system 
the universe we traversed many provinces france and
some parts italy and spain we examined the characters
 mankind as they are modified by the varieties natural
descent or the diversities political government in all
this we found peculiar gratification there is something
in the scent and impression a balmy atmosphere in the
lustre sunshine in the azure heaven and the purple
clouds in the opening prospects on this side and on that
in the contemplation verdure and fertility and industry
and simplicity and cheerfulness in all their variations in
the very act and exercise travelling peculiarly congenial
to the human frame it expands the heart it makes the
spirit dance and exquisitely disposes us for social enjoys
travels st leon
ment the mind becomes more elevated and refined it
assumes a microscopical and unwonted sensibility it feels
things which in ordinary moments are unheeded and unknown
 it enjoys things too evanescent for a name and too
minute to be arrested it trembles with pleasure through
every fibre and every articulation
one thing is necessary to be mentioned in this place
though while it adds to the fidelity delineation i am
aware it breaks the tone feeling and the harmony 
the picture but it is not my intention in this history to
pass myself for better than i am i have laid down to myself
the sacred maxim absolute truth and impartiality i
must confess therefore with whatever anguish my extreme
inferiority to my incomparable partner she had all the
simplicity genuine taste the more she delivered herself
up to nature the greater was her content all superfluous
appendages and show appeared to her as so many
obstacles to enjoyment she derived her happiness from
the tone her own mind and stood in no need the gaping
admiration and stupid wonder others to make her
feel herself happy but i retained the original vice my
mind the gestures worship and the voice applause
were necessary to me i did not suffice to myself i was not
satisfied with the tranquil and inglorious fruition genuine
pleasures forgetting the vain and anxious tumult the
world and forgotten by those who figured on its theatre
it may be that marguerite could and ought by insensible
degrees to have rooted out this disease my mind but
i am concerned only with the statement facts and i
know that no such thing was the effect our intercourse
this absurd passion did not however at this time lead
me to any fatal extremities it contented itself with the
frivolous gratification resulting from a certain portion 
ostentation and expense i maintained a considerable train
 servants my apartments were magnificent and my furniture
splendid when we travelled it was with an attendance
little short princely idiot that i was to
regard this as an addition to the genuine pleasures which i
have above enumerated when we were at home every
accidental guest was received and entertained with extratravels
 st leon
ordinary pomp a pomp not directed to add to his accommodation
but that was designed to leave him impressed
with astonishment and admiration at the spirit his host
often indeed did i feel this ostentation an encumbrance 
often did i languish for the ease and freedom which result
from a mediocrity circumstances but this i called
doing honour to my ancestors and my country and vindicating
the consideration due to the house st leon
to quit this painful recollection a circumstance which
tended at this time to fill the measure my happiness
consisted in the dear pledges which marguerite bore me 
our mutual affection it is impossible for him who has not
experienced it to conceive the accumulation which a genuine
tenderness derives from this source the difficulties
are many that attend upon pregnancy trifles are at that
period sources fatigue and injury it is necessary that
the person should be protected and the mind tranquil we
love to watch over a delicate plant that appears to call for
all our anxiety and attention there is in this case the
sentiment without the repulsive circumstances that attends
upon our sympathy with a dangerous and alarming disease
marguerite by her sensibility and growing attachment
abundantly rewarded my cares at length the critical period
arrives when an event so extraordinary occurs as cannot
fail to put the human frame in considerable jeopardy
never shall i forget the interview between us immediately
subsequent to her first parturition the effusion soul with
which we met each other after all danger seemed to have
subsided the kindness which animated us increased as it
was by ideas peril and suffering the sacred sensation
with which the mother presented her infant to her husband
or the complacency with which we read in each other's eyes
a common sentiment melting tenderness and inviolable
attachment 
this she seemed to say is the joint result our common
affection it partakes equally both and is the
shrine in which our sympathies and our life have been
poured together never to be separated let other lovers
testify their engagements by presents and tokens we record
and stamp our attachment in this precious creature a
 travels op st leon
creature that species which is more admirable than anything
else the world has to boast a creature susceptible 
pleasure and pain affection and love sentiment and
fancy wisdom and virtue this creature will daily
stand in need an aid we shall delight to afford will require
our meditations and exertions to forward its improvement
and confirm its merits and its worth we shall
each blend our exertions for that purpose and our union
confirmed by this common object our labour and affection
will every day become more sacred and indissoluble all
this the present weakness my beloved marguerite would
not allow her to say but all this occurred to my reflections
 and when we had time tranquilly to compare
our recollection the event it plainly appeared that in all
this our hearts and conceptions had most truly sympathised
the possessing a third object a common centre anxiety
to both is far from weakening the regard such a couple
for each other it does not separate or divert them it is
a new link connection each is attached to it the more
for the sake either each regards it as a sort branch
or scion representing the parent each rejoices in its
health its good humour its smiles its increase in size in
strength and in faculties principally from the idea the
gratification they will communicate to the other were it
not for this idea were it possible the pleasure should not
be mutual the sentiment would be stripped its principal
elevation and refinement it would be comparatively cold
selfish solitary and inane
in the first ten years our marriage my wife brought
me five children two sons and three daughters the second
son only died in his infancy my predominant passion at
this time was that domestic pleasures and employments
and i devoted myself jointly with the mother to the cultivation
 the minds my children they all in a considerable
degree rewarded our care they were all amiable
taught by the example their parents they lived in uncommon
harmony and affection charles the eldest was
a lad a bold and active disposition but the sentiments
 virtue and honour that were infused into him both by
marguerite and myself found a favourable reception and
travels op st leon 
promised to render those qualities which if left to themselves
might have been turbulent and dangerous productive
 the happiest consequences julia his eldest sister was
uncommonly mild and affectionate alive to the slightest
variations treatment profoundly depressed by every
mark unkindness but exquisitely sensible to demonstrations
 sympathy and attachment she appeared little
formed to struggle with the difficulties life and the frowns
 the world but in periods quietness and tranquillity
nothing could exceed the sweetness her character and
the fascination her manners her chief attachment was
to her mother though she was by no means capable her
mother's active beneficence and heroic fortitude louisa
the second daughter resembled her mother in person and
promised to resemble her in character marguerite the
youngest differed from the whole family in the playfulness
and frolic her disposition her vivacity was inexhaustible
and was continually displaying itself in innocent
tricks and smart unexpected sallies nothing could possibly
be more ingenuous than this admirable infant nothing
more kind considerate and enthusiastic in her tenderness
and grief when an occasion occurred to call forth
these sentiments but the moment the sorrowful occasion
was over she would resume all her vivacity and even
sometimes in the midst her tears some trait her
native humour would escape i know not whether all the
family were not more attached to the little marguerite than
to any other individual member as she certainly oftener
contributed to their amusement and pleasure such was
the amiable circle one and all whom have been involved
by me in the most tremendous ruin and disgrace
chapter v
charles was now nine years age his mother and
myself had delighted ourselves with observing and forwarding
the opening his infant mind and had hitherto been
 travels op st leon
contented with the assistance a neighbouring priest byway
 preceptor but as he was our only son we were
desirous that he should obtain every advantage education
we were neither us illiterate but in the course 
twentythree years which had elapsed since i was myself 
charles's age the progress literature and the literary
passion in europe had been astonishingly great and i was
anxious that he should realise in his own person every
benefit which the fortunate and illustrious period human
affairs in which he began to exist seemed to hold out to
him beside there was an impetuosity and forwardness in
his character that seemed ill to brook the profound solitude
and retirement in which his mother and i were contented
to live his case demanded companions his own
age a little world fellowbeings with whom he might
engage in their petty business and cares with whose passions
his own might jostle or might sympathise who might
kindle his emulation and open to him the field fraternal
associations and amity
there was however a considerable difficulty attendant
on this question the schools real literature in france
where languages were properly taught and science might
be acquired were at this time exceedingly few the
nearest university was that toulouse at the distance 
twentysix leagues this was practically speaking as far
from us as paris itself was then our darling child to be
torn from his parents from all he was accustomed to see
and all by whom he was loved to be planted in the midst
 strangers to have his mind excited to observation and
the spirit generous contention roused at the risk 
suppressing the tender affections his soul and the sentiments
 duty reliance and love there seemed however
to be no alternative it was necessary that a temporary
separation should take place intellectual improvement was
a point by all means to be pursued and we must direct
our efforts to keep alive along with it those winning qualities
and that softness heart which had hitherto rendered
charles so eminently our delight such were our
fond speculations and projects for the future
it was at length determined that i should proceed along
travels st leon 
with him to paris i could there observe upon the spot
the state the university and the means learning that
existed in the metropolis and could consult with some 
those eminent luminaries with whom i had become acquainted
at the house the marquis de damville marguerite
declined accompanying me upon this occasion her
father was dead she could not think quitting her daughters
for any considerable time and our nuptial engagement
 residing always in the country gave her a repugnance to
the removing with her whole family to paris it was left
probable that she might come to me when the business was
settled if at that time it was determined to leave her son at
the capital and that she might then conduct me to the
place which had been the scene all my happiness but
which i was destined never to revisit in peace
preliminaries being at length fully adjusted in the manner
that appeared suitable to the importance the occasion
i set off for the metropolis my country which i had seen
only once and that for a very short period in the course
 ten years that visit had been produced by a very melancholy
circumstance the death the marquis de damville
marguerite and myself had then been summoned
and arrived at his hotel but a few days before he expired
though extremely weakened by the mortal disease under
which he laboured he retained all the faculties his mind
and conversed with us in the most affectionate and endearing
terms he congratulated us upon our mutual felicity
nor could the situation in which we found him upon the
brink an everlasting oblivion all earthly things abate
the sincerity and fervour his delight he thanked me
for my carriage and conduct as a husband which he said
might with propriety be held up as a model to the human
species he applauded himself for that mingled discernment
and determination which as he affirmed had so
opportunely secured my virtue and his daughter's happiness
he trusted that i was now sufficiently weaned from those
habits which had formerly given him so much alarm at
the same time he conjured me by every motive that an
overflowing enthusiasm could suggest to persist in my good
resolutions and never to change that residence where i
travels st leon
had found every degree delight which the human
mind is in its present condition susceptible do not said
he be drawn aside by ambition do not be dazzled by the
gli utter idle pomp and decoration do not enter the remotest
circle the vortex dissipation live in the
midst your family cultivate domestic affection be the
solace and joy your wife watch for the present and
future welfare your children and be assured that you
will then be found no contemptible or beneficial member
 the community at large 
such were the last advices the marquis de damville
excellent man how ill were your lessons remembered 
how iu your kindness remunerated he died in the sixth
year our marriage the serious impression which this
event produced in my mind gave me small inclination to
enter into any species society and disposed me to quit
paris as soon as every respect had been paid to the obsequies
 the deceased
upon my arrival in the metropolis on the present occasion
i immediately sought to renew my acquaintance with
those amiable and eminent persons who had for the most
part constituted the circle the marquis de damville
they received me with that interest and attention that i
have usually found attendant on a cultivated mind the
pleasure was considerable that resulted from meeting them
thus again after ten years cessation intercourse a few
 them indeed were dead and others dispersed by various
accidents in different parts france or europe the
greater part however i still found in that celebrated city
which might well be considered as the metropolis the
civilised world the king had early been distinguished by
his love letters and the arts and added years while
they abated in his mind the eagerness ambition and glory
gave new strength to his more cultivated propensities the
liberality his conduct and the polished ease that characterised
his manners produced a general predilection in
favour the capital in which he resided
i found all my former friends matured and improved by
the silent influence time their knowledge was increased
their views rendered wider their conversation
travels op st leon 
was more amusing and instructive their manners more
bland and unaffected but if their characters had experienced
revolution mine was more materially changed i
had before encountered them with all the heat and presumption
 youth with no views so much present to my
mind as those chivalry and a factitious honour with no
experience but that a camp i was impetuous volatile
and dissipated i had not rested long enough upon any one
 the flowers intellect to extract its honey and my
mind was kept in a state preternatural agitation by the
passions a gamester it was now become cool moderate
and tranquil the society marguerite had contributed
much to the improvement my character i had li vet in
no idle and brutish solitude but in the midst contemplation
and letters and i had the passions a husband
and a father in the extremest degree attached to his family
these passions will be found perhaps to be the true school
 humanity the man whose situation continually exercises
in him the softest and most amiable charities our nature
will almost infallibly surpass his brethren in kindness to
sympathise with and promptness to relieve the distresses
 others
will it be accounted strange that in paris surrounded
by persons various knowledge and liberal benevolence i
found myself under the influence other feelings than any
i had lately experienced i was like a man who had suffered
long calamity in a famished vessel or a town besieged
and is immediately after introduced into the midst luxury
to a table loaded with the most costly dainties every viand
has to his apprehension an exquisite relish and every wine
a delicious flavour that he never perceived in them before
let no one infer that my love for marguerite was diminished
it has already sufficiently appeared in the course 
my narrative that no happiness could be more consummate
than mine was with this admirable woman had i been
called upon to choose for the seat my future life between
my paternal chateau in the bordelois with marguerite to
grace my abode on the one hand and all the gratifications
that paris could afford on the other i should not have
hesitated even for an instant but the mind man is
 travels st leon
made capacious various pleasures and a person sound
and uncorrupted judgment will perhaps always enjoy with
emotion the delights which for a long time before he had
not encountered however enviable his content may have
been under their absence i delighted to converse with
the men genius and refinement with whom paris at this
time abounded it was a feast soul which i had
rarely partaken in my rural retreat i delighted to combine
excellence with number and to a considerable degree at
least variety intercourse with sentiments regard and
friendship in these select societies i found no cold suppressions
and reserve their members were brethren indisposition
similar in their pursuits and congenial in their
sentiments when any one spoke it was that the person
to whom he addressed himself might apprehend what was
passing in his thoughts they participated with sincerity
and a liberal mind in each other's feelings whether gay
delight or melancholy disappointment
thus situated i forgot for a time my engagements with
marguerite the scenes st leon its fields its walks
its woods and its streams faded from my mind i forgot
the pleasure with which i had viewed my children sporting
on the green and the delicious rural suppers which i had
so often partaken with my wife beneath my vines and my
figtrees at the period the setting sun when i set out
for paris these images had dwelt upon my mind and saddened
my fancy at every stage i felt myself removed
still further from the scene where my treasures and my
affections were deposited but shortly after new scenes
and new employments engaged my thoughts the pleasures
which i sought but weakly at first every time they
were tasted increased my partiality for them i seemed fora
time to be under the influence an oblivion my former
life thus circumstanced the folly which had so deep a
root in my character took hold me i hired a magnificent
hotel and entertained at my own expense those persons
in whose society i principally delighted my circles
became more numerous than those the marquis de damville
and were conducted in a very different style splendour
and profusion i corresponded with marguerite but
travels st leon 
i continually found some new pretext for lengthening my
stay and she on her part though the kindest and most
indulgent women became seriously alarmed and unhappy

as my parties were more numerous than those the
marquis de damville had been they were more mixed
among others i occasionally associated with some those
nobleman who had been the companions my former dissipation
and gaming an obvious consequence resulted
from this parties play were occasionally proposed tome
i resisted i yielded my first compliances were
timid hesitating and painful i recollected the lessons
and exhortations my excellent fatherinlaw at length
however my alarms abated i reproached myself with the
want an honourable confidence in my own firmness and
the cowardice supposing that i was not to be trusted with
the direction my conduct
one evening i ventured beyond the cautious limits i had
at first prescribed myself and won a considerable sum
this incident produced a strong impression upon me and
filled my mind with tumult and agitation there was a
secret that i had concealed almost from myself but which
now recurred to me with tenfold violence j was living
beyond the means i had to discharge my expenses my
propensity this sort seemed to be fatal and irresistible
my marriage with marguerite had occurred opportunely to
heal the breaches i had at that time made in my fortune
and to take from me the consciousness embarrassments
which i should otherwise have deeply felt the death 
the marquis however deplorable in other respects happened
at a period when the spirit profusion and magnificence
which characterised me had again involved my affairs inconsiderable
difficulty it might be supposed that these two
cases experience would have sufficed to extirpate my
folly but they had rather the contrary effect in each 
them the event was such as to prevent extravagance and
thoughtlessness from producing their genuine results and
 consequence they appeared less criminal and mischievous
in my eyes than otherwise they probably would have appeared
i rather increased than diminished my establish

ment upon the death my fatherinlaw i had no reasonable
prospect any property hereafter to descend to me
that should exonerate me from the consequences further
prodigality but i did not advert to this i saw myself
surrounded by my children they were the delight and solace
 my life and yet i was heedless their interests
sometimes i resolved upon a more rigid economy but
economy is a principle that does not easily lay hold any
but a heart framed to receive it it is a business attentive
and vigilant detail it easily escapes the mind amidst
the impetuosity the passions the obstinacy rooted
propensities and the seduction long established habits
marguerite indeed did not share with me in these follies
the simplicity and ingenuousness her mind were such
that she would have been as happy in a cottage as a palace
but though she did not partake my vices an illjudged
forbearance and tenderness for my feelings did not permit
her effectually to counteract them this is perhaps the
only defect character i am able to impute to her
after i had won the sum to which i have alluded i
retired to my hotel full anxious thoughts it produced
upon me in some degree the same effect as ordinarily belongs
to a great calamity i lay all night sleepless and
disturbed ruin and despair presented themselves to my
mind in a thousand forms heedless prodigality and dilapidated
revenues passed in review before me i counted
the years my life i had completed the thirtysecond
year my age this was scarcely half the probable duration
 human existence how was i to support the remaining
period a period little assorted to difficulties and expedients 
and which in the close it seems imperiously to call for
every indulgence hitherto an interval four or five
years had repeatedly sufficed to involve me in serious embarrassment
my children were growing up around me 
my family was likely to become still larger as my offspring
increased in years their demands upon my revenues would
be more considerable were these demands to be slighted 
were my daughters nay was the heir my rank and my
name to be committed to the compassion the world
unprovided and forlorn what a cheerless prospect what
travels st leon 
a gloomy and disconsolate hue did these ideas spread upon
that future which the health the human mind requires
to have gilded with the beams hope and expectation i
had already tried the expedient economy and i had
uniformly found this inestimable and only sheetanchor 
prudence gliding from my deluded grasp could i promise
myself better success in future there seemed to be something
in my habits whether inattention ostentation or
inconsistency that baffled the strongest motives by which
parsimony and frugality can be enforced
why did these thoughts importunately recur to me in
the present moment they were the suggestions a malignant
genius thoughts the destination which was
to lead me into a gulf misery and guilt while i was
going on in a regular train expense while i was scooping
the mine that was to swallow me and my hopes together
i had the art to keep these reflections at bay now
that i had met with an unexpected piece good fortune
they rushed upon me with irresistible violence unfortunate
coincidence miserable rather let me say guilty abandoned
miscreant 
as soon as i rose in the morning i went to the closet
where the evening before i had deposited my recent acquisitions
i spread out the gold before me i gazed
upon it with intentness my eyes a moment after rolled
in vacancy i traversed the apartment with impatient steps
all the demon seemed to make his descent upon my soul
this was the first time that i had ever felt the struggle 
conscious guilt and dishonour i was far indeed from anticipating
that species guilt and that species ruin
which soon after overwhelmed me my mind did not once
recur to the possibility any serious mischief i dwelt
only as gamesters perhaps usually do upon the alternative
between acquisition and no acquisition i did not take into
the account the ungovernableness my own passions i
assumed it as unquestionable that i could stop when i
pleased the thoughts that tortured me were in the first
place those a sanguine and unexperienced adventurer ina
lottery whose mind rests not for a moment upon the sum
he has risked but who having in fancy the principal prize
k 
 travels st leon
already in his possession and having distributed it to various
objects and purposes sometimes fearfully recurs to the possibility
 his disappointment and anticipates with terror
what will be his situation if deprived this imaginary
wealth i had now for the first time opened my eyes to
the real state my affairs and i clung with proportionable
vehemence to this plank which was to bear me from the
storm in the second place i felt though darkly and unwillingly
the immorality my conception to game may
in some instances not be in diametrical opposition to liberality
 mind but he who games for the express purpose
 improving his circumstances must be an idiot if he does
not sometimes recollect that the money lost may be as serious
a mischief to his neighbour as the money gained can
possibly be a benefit to himself it is past a question that
he who thus turns his amusement into his business loses
the dignity a man honour and puts himself upon a
level with the most avaricious and usurious merchant
though i was far from having digested a specific plan
 enriching myself by these discreditable means yet the
very tumult my thoughts operated strongly to lead me
once more to the gamingtable i was in no humour to
busy myself with my own thoughts the calmness literary
discussion and the polished interchange wit which had
lately so much delighted me had now no attraction for my
heart the turbulence a scene high play alone had
power to distract my attention from the storm within i
won a second time i felt the rapidity and intenseness 
my contemplations still further accelerated i will not over
again detail what they were suffice it to say that my
hopes became more ardent my conception the necessity
 this resource more impressive and my alarm lest this
last expedient should fail me more tormenting
the next time i lost half as much as the sum my
winnings i then proceeded for several days in a nearly
regular alternation gain and loss this as soon as the
fact unavoidably forced itself upon my mind only served
to render my thoughts more desperate no exclaimed i
it was not for this that i entered upon so tormenting a
pursuit it is not for this that i have deserted the learned
societies which were lately my delight and committed mytravels
 st leon 
self to a sea disquiet and anxiety i came not here like
a boy for amusement or like one who has been bred in
the lap ignorance and wealth to seek a relief from the
burden existence and to find a stimulus to animate my
torpid spirits am i then to be for ever baffled am i to
cultivate a tract land which is to present me nothing in
return but unvaried barrenness am i continually to wind up
my passions and newstring my attention in vain am i
a mere instrument to be played upon by endless hopes and
fears and tormenting wishes am i to be the sport 
events the fool promise always agitated with near approaching
good yet always deluded 
this frame mind led me on insensibly to the most
extravagant adventures it threw me in the first place into
the hands notorious gamblers men real property
shrunk from the stakes i proposed as though they were
in some degree infected with the venom gaming their
infection was not so deep as mine nor with my desperation
 thought the players with whom i engaged were for
the most part well known to every one but myself not to
be able to pay the sums they played for if they lost nay
this fact might be said in some sense to be known to me as
well as the rest though i obstinately steeled myself against
the recollection it one evening i won one these
persons a very large sum for which i suffered him to play
with me upon honour the consequence was simple the
next morning he took his departure from paris and i heard
 him no more
before this however the tide success had set strongly
against me i had sustained some serious vicissitudes 
and while i was playing with the wretch i have just mentioned
my eagerness increased as my good luck began and
i flattered myself that i should now avenge myself fortune
for some her late unkindness my anguish
why should i call the thing by a disproportionate and
trivial appellation my agony was by so much the
greater when i found that this person the very individual
who had already stripped me considerable sums had
disappeared and left me without the smallest benefit from
my imaginary winnings

been gradually worked up into a paroxysm an unexpected
turn arrives and he is made the most miserable men
never shall i cease to recollect the sensation i have repeatedly
felt in the instantaneous sinking the spirits the
conscious fire that spread over my visage the anger in my
eye the burning dryness my throat the sentiment that
in a moment was ready to overwhelm with curses the cards
the stake my own existence and all mankind how every
malignant and insufferable passion seemed to rush upon my
soul what nights dreadful solitude and despair did i
repeatedly pass during the progress my ruin it was the
night the soul my mind was wrapped in a gloom that
could not be pierced my heart was oppressed with a
weight that no power human or divine was equal to
remove my eyelids seemed to press downward with an
invincible burden my eyeballs were ready to start and
crack their sockets i lay motionless the victim ineffable
horror the whole endless night seemed to be
travels st leon 
filled with one vast appalling immovable idea it was a
stupor more insupportable and tremendous than the
utmost whirl pain or the fiercest agony exquisite perception

one day that my mind was in a state excessive anguish
and remorse i had already contrived by this infernal
means to dispossess myself the half my property
my son came unexpectedly into my chamber for sometime
i had scarcely ever seen him such is a gamester 
all the night while he slept i was engaged in these haunts
 demons all the day while he was awake and studying
with his masters or amusing himself i was in my bedchamber
endeavouring to court a few broken hours sleep
when notwithstanding the opposition our habits i had
the opportunity seeing him i rather shunned to use
than sought to embrace it the sight him had a savour
 bitterness in it that more than balanced all the solace 
natural affection it brought before me the image his
mother and his sisters it presented to my soul a frightful
tale deserted duties it was more galling and envenomed
than the sting scorpions
starting at the sound the opening door i called out
abruptly and with some harshness who is there what
do you want 
it is i sir replied the boy it is charles come to
pay his duty to you 
f i do not want you now you should not come but
when you know i am at leisure answered i somewhat
disturbed
very well sir very well i am going as he spoke
his voice seemed suffocated with tears he was on the
point shutting the door and leaving me to myself
 charles said i not well knowing what it was i intended
to do
he returned
c come here my dear boy 
i took his hand i drew him between my knees i hid
my face in his neck i shook with the violence my emotion

go go boy you perceive i cannot talk to you
 travels st leon
i pushed him gently from me
papa cried he i do not like to leave you i
know i am but a boy and can be but little use to you
if mamma were with you i would not be troublesome i
should cry when i saw you were grieved but i would ask
no questions and would leave you because you desired it
i hope you have not had any bad news 
no my boy no come to me tomorrow and i will
be at leisure and will talk a great deal to you
ah papa tomorrow every day that i did not see
you i thought it would be tomorrow and there was one
tomorrow and another tomorrow and so many that it
seemed as if you had forgotten to speak to me at all
 why charles you do not doubt my word i tell
you that tomorrow you shall see me as long as you please
well well i will wait but do then let it be all day
i will not go to college and it shall be a holiday papa i
do not like my lessons half so well as i did since i have
neither you nor mamma that i can tell what they are
about
goodbye charles be a good boy remember tomorrow
 goodbye 
papa now i am sure you look a good deal better than
you did at first let me tell you something about the
lesson i read this morning it was a story seleucus
the dorian who put out one his own eyes that he
might preserve eyesight to his son
this artless story thus innocently introduced cut me to
the soul i started in my chair and hid my face upon the
table
papa what is the matter indeed you frighten me 
 zaleucus was a father what then am i 
t yes zaleucus was very good indeed but do you
know his son was very naughty it was his disobedience
and wickedness that made him liable to such a punishment
i would not for the world be like zaleucus's son i hope
papa you will never suffer from my wilfulness you shall
not papa indeed indeed 
i caught the boy in my arms no you are very good 
you are too good i cannot bear it 
travels op st leon 
well papa i wish i were able to show you that i
love you as well as ever zaleucus loved his son i
i was melted with the ingenuousness the boy's expression
i quitted him i paced up and down the
room suddenly as if by paroxysm insanity i seized
my child by the arm i seated myself i drew him towards
me i put my eye upon him
boy how dare you talk to me zaleucus do you
mean to insinuate a reproach do i not discharge a father's
duty if i do not know urchin i will not be insulted
by my child 
the boy was astonished he burst into tears and was
silent
i was moved by his evident distress no child you
have no father i am afraid you have not you do not
know my baseness you do not know that i am the deadliest
foe you have in the world
dear papa do not talk thus do not i know that you
are the best men do not i love you and mamma
better than every body else put together 
te well charles cried i endeavouring to compose myself
 we will talk no more now did not i tell you you
should not come to me but when you knew it was a proper
time i hope you will never have reason to hate me
i never will hate you papa do to me what you will t r
he saw i wished to be alone and left me
chapter vi
in the evening the same day my beloved marguerite
arrived unexpectedly at paris in the beginning our
separation i had been to the last degree punctual in my
letters i had no pleasure so great as retiring to my
closet and pouring out my soul to the most adorable 
women by degrees i relaxed in punctuality ordinary
occupations however closely pursued have a method in
them that easily combines with regularity in points an
incidental nature but gaming when pursued with avidity
travels st leon
subverts all order and forces every avocation from the
place assigned it when my insane project supplying
the inadequateness my fortune by this expedient began
to produce an effect exactly opposite i could not but with
the extremest difficulty string my mind to write to the
mistress my soul i endeavoured not to think with
distinctness and attention the persons whose happiness
was most nearly involved with mine i said to myself
yet another venture must be tried fortune shall change
the animosity with which she has lately pursued me i
will repair the breaches that have been sustained and i
shall then return with tenfold avidity to subjects that at
present i dare not fix my mind upon my letters were
accordingly short unfrequent and unsatisfactory and
those marguerite discovered increasing anguish perturbation
and anxiety what a change in the minds 
both had the lapse a few months produced not that
my attachment had suffered the diminution a single
particle but that attachment which had lately been the
source our mutual felicity was now fraught only with
distress my mind was filled with horrors and marguerite
expected from me an encouragement and consolation in
absence which alas i had it not in my power to give 
i had now continued in paris for a time vastly greater
than i had originally proposed after having remained
more than ten days without receiving one word intelligence
a letter mine was delivered to marguerite more
short mysterious and distressing to her feelings than any
that had preceded the ten days silence from me who
at first had never missed an opportunity pouring out
my soul to her and contributing to her pleasure was exquisitely
painful there is scarcely any thing that produces
such a sickness the heart as the repeated prorogation
 hope but when the letter arrived that had
been so anxiously looked for when the handwriting 
the superscription was recognised when the letter was
treasured up for the impatiently desired moment solitude
that the sacred emotions the heart might suffer no
interruption and when it at last appeared so cold so
ominous so withering to the buds affection the detertravels
 st leon l
mention marguerite was speedily formed the relations
that bound us together were too mighty a value
to be dispensed or to be trifled with she felt them as
the very cords existence for ten years she had known
no solace that was disconnected from my idea no care but
 our own happiness and that our offspring benevolent
she was almost beyond human example and interested
for the welfare all she knew but these were
brief and mutable concerns they were not incorporated
with the stamina her existence i was the whole world
to her she had no idea satisfaction without me her
firmness had been sufficiently tried by the interposal 
separation and absence how was she to interpret the
obscurity that had now arisen had i forgotten my
family and my wife had i been corrupted and debauched
by that paris the effects which upon my
character her father had so deeply apprehended had i
in contempt every thing sacred entered into some new
attachment had the attractions some new beauty in
the metropolis made me indifferent to the virtue my
children and the life their mother perhaps the length
 our attachment had infected me with satiety and the
inconstancy my temper had been roused by the charms
 novelty perhaps the certainty her kindness and
regard had no longer allurements for me and i might be
excited to the pursuit another by the pleasures hope
combined with uncertainty and a coyness that seemed
to promise compliance hereafter even while it pronounced
a present denial these were the images that haunted her
mind they engendered all the wildness and all the torments
 a delirious paroxysm she resolved that no time
should be sacrificed to needless uncertainty and that no
effort hers should be unexpected to prevent the mischief
she feared
it was evening when she arrived i was upon the
point repairing to that scene nightly resort the source
 all my guilt and all my miseries i enquired my
son's valet where he was and how he had been in the
course the day he was gone to bed he had appeared
unusually sad sometimes in tears and while he was
oxs travels op st leon
undressing had sighed deeply two or three times while
i was collecting this account in my own apartment the
gates the hotel opened and a number horsemen
entered the courtyard i was somewhat surprised because
though i was accustomed to see much company
few my acquaintance visited me at so late an hour
except on the evenings appropriated to receive them i
crossed the saloon to enquire one the servants exclaimed
 it is bernardin's voice it must be my mistress
that is come 
nothing could be further from my mind than the
thought her arrival i flew through the passage i
was on the spot the moment that the servant prepared to
conduct his mistress from the litter i received marguerite
in my arms and led her into the house if i had expected
her arrival i should infallibly have met her at this
moment with anxiety and confusion i should have gone
round the circle my thoughts and should not have had
confidence to encounter the beam her eye but the
event was so unexpected as to drive all other ideas from
my mind and in consequence i enjoyed several minutes
ages rather let me say the sincerest transport
i kissed the mistress my soul with ecstasy i gazed
upon her well known lineaments and features i listened
to the pleasing melody her voice i w r as intoxicated
with delight upon occasions like this it seems as if
every former joy that had marked the various periods 
intercourse distilled its very spirit and essence to compose
a draught ten times more delicious and refined than
had ever before been tasted our meeting was like awaking
from the dead it was the emancipation the weary
captive who exchanges the dungeon's gloom for the lustre
 the morning and who feels a celestial exhilaration 
heart the very memory which had been insensibly wearing
away from his treacherous brain all my senses partook
 the rapture marguerite seemed to shed ambrosial
odours round her her touch was thrilling her lips were
nectar her figure was that a descended deity 
her pleasure was not less than mine it is indeed absurd
it may be termed profanation to talk solitary
travels st leon 
pleasure no sensation ordinarily distinguished by that
epithet can endure the test a moment's inspection when
compared with a social enjoyment it is then only that a
man is truly pleased when pulse replies to pulse when the
eyes discourse eloquently to each other when in responsive
tones and words the soul is communicated altogether weare
conscious a sober a chaste and dignified intoxication
an elevation spirit that does not bereave the mind itself
and that endures long enough for us to analyse and savour
the causes our joy
for some time we rested on a sofa each filled and
occupied with the observation the other my eyes assured
marguerite the constancy my affection my
kisses were those chaste undivided entire attachment
our words were insignificant and idle the broken and
incoherent phrases a happiness that could not be silent
at length marguerite exclaimed it is enough my fears
are vanished i have no questions to ask no doubts to remove
yet why my reginald did you suffer those doubts
to gather those fears to accumulate surely you knew
the singleness my affection how many painful days
and hours might you have saved me almost by a word i
forgive me my love replied i waste not the golden
hour meeting in recrimination feeling as your angelic
goodness now makes me feel i wonder at myself that i
could for one moment have consented to separation that i
could have thought any thing but this existence or that
having experienced the joys that you have bestowed i
could lose all image the past and dwelling in a desert
imagine it paradise 
recrimination rejoined marguerite no my love 
you make me too happy to leave room for any thing but
gratitude and affection forgive me reginald if i pretend
that in meeting you thus i find myself your superior
in happiness and love you only awake from lethargy
forgetfulness yourself and me but i awake from
anguish a separation that i desired not at first and 
which i hourly wished to see an from doubts that
would intrude and refused to be expelled from the incessant
contemplation and regret a felicity once possessed
travels st leon
but possessed no longer melancholy ideas gloomy prognostic
overspread my sleepless nights and bedewed my
pillow with tears this it is that at last has driven me
from my family and daughters resolved to obtain the certainty
 despair or the dispersion my fears have i
known all this and think you that i do not enjoy with rapture
this blissful moment 
while we were thus conversing charles entered the
room he was not yet asleep when his mother arrived 
he heard her voice and hastened to put on his clothes
that he might rush into her arms the pleasure marguerite
had conceived from our meeting and the affectionate
serenity that had taken possession her soul infused
double ardour into the embraces she bestowed on her son
he gazed earnestly in her face he kissed her with fervency
 but was silent
why charles said she what is the matter with you 
are not you glad to see me 
that i am mamma so glad that i do not know what
to do with myself i was afraid i never should have been
glad again 
 pooh boy what do you mean you were not mothersick
were you 
yes indeed i was sick sick at heart not that i ama
coward i think that i could have been satisfied to have
been without either my father or you for a little while
but papa is so altered you cannot think he never smiles
and looks happy and when i see him instead making
me joyful as it used to do it makes me sad i
dear reginald replied the mother looking at me is
it possible that while my heart was haunted with fear and
suspicions separation alone should have had such an effect
on you 
i dare say it was that interposed the boy i could
not make papa smile all i could do but now you are come
he will soon be well how much he must love you
mamma 
the artless prattle my son struck anguish to my soul
and awakened a whole train tormenting thoughts alas 
thought i can it indeed be love that thus contrives against
travels op st leon 
the peace its object would to god my child that
my thoughts were as simple and pure as thy innocent
bosom 
 and yet added the boy as if recollecting himself if
he couldn't see you sure that was no reason for him to avoid
me he seemed as much afraid me as i have seen
some my playfellows a snake indeed mamma it
was a sad thing that when i wanted him to kiss me and
press me to his bosom he shrunk away from me there
now it was just so as he looks now that papa used to
frown upon me i cannot tell how often now is not that
ugly mamma 
i could no longer govern the tumult my thoughts
peace urchin cried i why did you come to mar
the transport our meeting just now marguerite i
forgot myself and was happy now all the villain rises
in my soul 
my wife was so astonished at the perturbation my
manner and at the words i uttered that she was scarcely
able to articulate reginald in broken accents she exclaimed
 my love my husband 
no matter said i it shall yet be well my heart
assures me it shall be not disturbed my love i will
never cause you a moment's anguish i would sooner die a
thousand deaths forget the odious thoughts that poor
charles has excited in me so unseasonably they were
mere idle words depend upon it they were 
while i was speaking marguerite hid her face upon the
sofa i took her hand and by my caresses endeavoured to
soothe and compose her at length turning to me
e reginald said she in a voice anguish do you then
endeavour to hide from me the real state your thoughts 
was the joy that attended our meeting imperishable and deceitful
 after ten years unbounded affection and confidence
am i denied to be the partner your bosom 
no marguerite no this was but the thought a moment
 by tomorrow's dawn it shall have no existence in
my bosom why should i torment you with what so soon
shall have no existence to myself meanwhile be assured
my love instead suffering diminution is more full more
fervent and entire than it ever was 
' travels st leon
at this instant my mind experienced an extraordinary impression
instead being weaned by the presence this
admirable woman from my passion for gaming it became
stronger than ever if charles had not entered at the critical
moment he did i should have remained with marguerite
and amidst the so long un tasted solace love have
at least for this night forgotten my cares but that occurrence
had overturned every thing had uncovered the wounds
 my bosom and awakened conceptions that refused to be
laid to sleep again the arms my wife that were about
to embrace me suddenly became to me a nest scorpions
i could as soon have rested and enjoyed myself upon the
top vesuvius when it flamed new as i was to this
species anguish tranquilly and full virtuous contentment
as i had hitherto passed the years my married state
the pangs a guilty conscience i was wholly unable to bear
i rose from my seat and was upon the point quitting
the room
marguerite perceived by my manner that there was something
extraordinary passing in my mind where are you
going reginald said she
i answered with a slight nod not far i replied
attempting an air apathy and unconcern
she was not satisfied you are not going out she
enquired
i returned to where i had been sitting my love i
was going out at the moment your arrival it is necessary
i assure you i hope shall soon be back i am
sorry i am obliged to leave you compose yourself you
are in want rest and had better go to bed
stop reginald afford me a minute's leisure before
you depart leave us charles good night my dear
boy kiss me remember that your mother is now in the
same house with you and sleep in peace
the boy quitted the room
 reginald said the mother i have no wish to control
your desires or be a spy upon your actions but your
conduct seems so extraordinary in this instance as to dispense
me from the observation common rules i have
always been a complying wife i have never set myself in
contradiction to your will i appeal to yourself for the
travels op st leon 
truth this i despise however those delicacies an adherence
to which would entail upon us the sacrifice all
that is most valuable in human life can i shut my ears
upon the mysterious expressions which charles's complaints
have extorted from you can i be insensible to the extraordinary
purpose you declare leaving me when i have
yet been scarcely half an hour under the roof with you 
before charles came in you seem to have entertained no
such design
my love replied i how seriously you comment upon
the most insignificant incident is it extraordinary that your
unexpected arrival should at first have made me forget an
engagement that i now recollect 
f st leon answered my wife before you indulge in
surprise at my earnestness recollect the circumstances that
immediately preceded it through successive weeks i have
waited for some satisfactory and agreeable intelligence from
you i had a right before this to have expected your return
uncertainty and a thousand fearful apprehensions have at
length driven me from my home and brought me to paris
i am come here for satisfaction to my doubts and peace to
my anxious heart wonder not therefore if you find
something more earnest and determined in my proceedings
now than upon ordinary occasions give me i conjure
you give me ease and relief if you are able if not at least
allow me this consolation to know the worst

ability in any degree providing for and superintending
my family it became therefore incumbent upon her to
exert herself for the welfare all had we never fallen
under this astonishing reverse i might have spent my whole
life in daily intercourse with this admirable woman without
becoming acquainted with half the treasures her
mind she was my steward and from the result her
own reflections made the most judicious disposition my
property she was my physician not by administering
medicines to my body but by carefully studying and exerting
herself to remove the distemper mind unfortunately
no distempers are so obstinate as mental ones yet
had my distemper had any lighter source than an upbraiding
conscience i am persuaded the wisdom marguerite
would have banished it she was the instructor my
children her daughters felt no want a governess j and
i am even ready to doubt whether the lessons his mother
did not amply supply to charles his loss an education in
the university paris the love order the activity
the industry the cheerfulness let me say this illustrious
matron became contagious to all the inhabitants my
roof once and again have i stolen a glance at them or
viewed them from a distance busied sometimes gravely
sometimes gaily in the plain and have whispered to my
bursting heart how miserable am i how happy they 
so insurmountable is the barrier that divides innocence
from guilt they may breathe the same air they may
dwell under the same roof j they may be one family and
one blood they may associate with each other every day
and every hour j but they can never assimilate never have
any genuine contact is there a happier family than mine
in all the valley this farfamed republic is there a
family more virtuous or more cultivated with all the refinements
that conduce to the true dignity man i i
only am its burden and its stain the pleasure with
which i am surrounded on every side finds a repellent
quality in my heart that will not suffer its approach to
whatever is connected with me i communicate misfortune
whenever i make my appearance those countenances that
at all other times spoke contentment and hilarity fall into
travels st leon 
sadness like a pestilential wind i appear to breathe
blast to the fruits nature and sickliness to its aspect
marguerite expostulated with me in the most soothing
manner upon the obstinacy my malady my reginald
 my love said she cease to be unhappy or to
reproach yourself you were rash in the experiment you
made upon the resources your family but have you
done us mischief or have you conferred a benefit i more
than half incline to the latter opinion let us at length
dismiss artificial tastes and idle and visionary pursuits
that do not flow in a direct line from any the genuine
principles our nature here we are surrounded with
sources happiness here we may live in true patriarchal
simplicity what is chivalry what are military prowess and
glory believe me they are the passions a mind depraved
that with ambitious refinement seeks to be wise beyond
the dictates sentiment or reason there is no happiness
so solid or so perfect as that which disdains these
refinements you like me are fond the luxuriant and
romantic scenes nature here we are placed in the midst
 them how idle it would be to wish to change our
arbours our verdant lanes and thickets for vaulted roofs
and gloomy halls and massy plate alas reginald it is
i fear too true that the splendour in which we lately lived
has its basis in oppression and that the superfluities 
the rich are a boon extorted from the hunger and misery
 the poor here we see a peasantry more peaceful and
less oppressed than perhaps any other tract the earth
can exhibit they are erect and independent at once
friendly and fearless is not this a refreshing spectacle 
i now begin practically to perceive that the cultivators 
the fields and the vineyards are my brethren and my
sisters and my heart bounds with joy as i feel my relations
to society multiply how cumbrous is magnificence 
the moderate man is the only free he who reduces all
beneath him to a state servitude becomes himself the
slave his establishment and all his domestics to
diminish the cases in which the assistance others is felt
absolutely necessary is the only genuine road to independence
we can now move wherever we please without

waiting the leisure others our simple repasts require
no tedious preparation and do not imprison us in saloons
and eating rooms yet we partake them with a more
genuine appetite and rise from them more truly refreshed
than from the most sumptuous feast i prepare for my
meal hy industry and exercise and when it is over amuse
myself with my children in the fields and the shade
though i love the sight the peasants i would not be a
peasant i would have a larger stock ideas and a
wider field activity i love the sight peasants only
for their accessories or by comparison they are comparatively
more secure than any other large masses men
and the scenes in the midst which they are placed are
delightful to sense but i would not sacrifice in prone
oblivion the best characteristics my nature i put in my
claim for refinements and luxuries but they are the refinements
and purifying intellect and the luxuries 
unjustly simple taste i would incite the whole world if
i knew how to do it to put in a similar claim i would
improve my mind i would enlarge my understanding i
would contribute to the instruction all connected with
me and to the mass human knowledge the pleasures
i would pursue and disseminate though not dependent on
a large property are such as could not be understood by
the rustic and the savage our son bred in these fields
indeed will probably never become a preux chevalier or
figure in the roll military heroes but he may become
something happier and better he may improve his mind
and cultivate his taste he may be the counsellor and protector

in which he resides he may institute in his adoptive
country new defences for liberty new systems public
benefit and new improvements life there is no character
more admirable than the patriotyeoman who unites
with the utmost simplicity garb and manners an understanding
fraught with information and sentiment and a
heart burning with the love mankind such were patricius
and regulus among the ancients and such was
tell the founder the helvetic liberty for my part
i am inclined to be thankful that this unexpected reverse
travels op st leon 
in our circumstances has made me acquainted with new
pleasures and opened to my mind an invaluable lesson
if you could but be prevailed on to enter into our pleasures
to dismiss idle reproaches and pernicious propensities our
happiness would then be complete 
the expostulations marguerite often excited my attention
often my respect and sometimes produced a sort
 imperfect conviction but the conviction was transient
and the feelings i have already described as properly my
own returned when the fresh and vivid impression what
i had heard was gone it was in vain that i heard the
praises simplicity and innocence i was well pleased to
see those who were nearest to me not affecting contentment
but really contented with these things but i could
not be contented for them the lessons my education
had left too deep an impression i could myself have surrendered
my claim to admiration and homage as a penance
for my misdeeds but i could not figure to myself a genuine
satisfaction unaccompanied by these accessories 
and this satisfaction i obstinately and impatiently coveted
for those i loved
chapter viii
while i murmured in bitterness soul at the lowness to
which my family was reduced a still heavier calamity impended
as if in vengeance against the fantastic refinements
 distress over which i brooded
i was wandering as i had often done with a gloomy
and rebellious spirit among the rocks a few miles distant
from the place our habitation it was the middle 
summer the weather had been remarkably fine but i
disdained to allow the gratifications which arise from a pure
atmosphere and a serene sky to find entrance in my soul
my excursions had for some days been incessant and the
sun which matured the corn and blackened the grapes
g 
 travels op st leon
around had imbrowned my visage and boiled in my blood
i drank in fierceness and desperation from the fervour 
his beams one night as in sullen mood i watched his
betting from a point the rock i perceived the clearness
 the day subsiding in a threatening evening the
clouds gathered in the west and as night approached were
overspread with a deep dye the fiercest crimson the
wind rose and during the hours darkness its roaring
were hollow and tempestuous
in the morning the clouds were hurried rapidly along
and the air was changed from a long series sultriness to
a nipping cold this change the atmosphere i disregarded
and pursued my rambles a little before noon
however the air suddenly grew so dark as to produce a
sensation perfectly tremendous i felt as if the darkest
night had never exceeded it the impetuous motion to
which i had been impelled partly by the fever in my blood
and partly by the turbulence the season was suspended
mechanically i looked round me for shelter but i could
ill distinguish the objects that were near me when a flash
 lightning blue and sulphureous came directly in my
face with a brightness that threatened to extinguish the
organ vision the thunder that followed was a
length and loudness to admit no comparison from any
object with which i am acquainted the bursts were so
frequent as almost to confound themselves with each other
at present i thought only myself and the recent habits
 my mind were not calculated to make me peculiarly accessible
to fear i stood awestruck but rather with the awe
that inheres to a cultivated imagination than that which
consists in apprehension i seemed ready to mount amidst
the clouds and penetrate the veil with which nature conceals
her operations i would have plunged into the recesses
in which the storm was engendered and bared my bosom
to the streaming fire meanwhile my thoughts were solemnised
and fixed by observing the diversified dance the
lightnings upon the points the rocks contrasting as they
did in the strongest manner with the darkness in which
the rest the scene was enveloped this added contention
 the elements did not however suspend the raging
travels st leon 
 the wind presently a storm mingled hail and rain
poured from the clouds and was driven with inconceivable
impetuosity the hailstones were so astonishing a magnitude
that before i was aware i was beaten by them to
the ground not daring to attempt to rise again i simply
endeavoured to place myself in such a manner as might best
protect me from their violence i therefore remained prostrate
listening to the force with which they struck upon the
earth and feeling the rebound their blows from different
parts my body
in about twenty minutes the shower abated and in half
an hour was entirely over when i began to move i was
surprised at the sensation soreness which i felt in every
part me i raised myself upon my elbow and saw the
hailstones in some places lying in heaps like hillocks 
ice while in others they had ploughed up the surface and
buried themselves in the earth as i looked further i perceived
immense trees torn from their roots and thrown to
a great distance upon the declivity to the noise that they
made in their descent which must have been astonishingly
great i had been at the time insensible such were the
marks which the tempest had left upon the mountains
in the plain it was still worse i could perceive the soil
for long spaces together converted into a morass the standing
corn beaten down and buried in the mud the vines
torn into a thousand pieces the fruit trees demolished and
even in some places the animals themselves lambs sheep and
cows strewing the fields with their mangled carcasses the
whole hopes the year over which my eyes had glanced a
few minutes before for it was near the period harvest
were converted into the most barren and dreary scene that
any quarter the globe ever witnessed i was mounted
upon a considerable eminence and had an extensive prospect
 this horrible devastation
as i stood gazing in mute astonishment suddenly a fear
came over me that struck dampness to my very heart
what was the situation my own family and their little
remaining property amidst this dreadful ruin i was ina
position where though i nearly faced our habitation a
point the rock intercepted it from my sight the 
travels op st leon
stale was but a small one yet it would require a considerable
circuit to overcome i flew along the path with a
speed that scarcely permitted me to breathe when i had
passed the upper rock the whole extensive scene opened
upon me in an instant what were my sensations when
i perceived that the devastation had been even more complete
here than on the side where i first viewed it my
own cottage in particular which that very morning had
contained and i hoped continued to contain all that was
most dear to my heart seemed to stand an entire solitude
in the midst an immense swamp
marguerite whose idea upon our retreat into switzerland
had been that conforming without reserve to the new
situation that was allotted us had immediately expended
the whole what remained from the shipwreck our fortune
in the purchase the cottage in which we dwelt and
a small portion land around it sufficient with economy
for the support our family under her direction the
hills had been covered with vines and the fields with corn
she had purchased cows to furnish us with milk and sheep
with their fleeces and had formed her establishment upon
the model the swiss peasantry in our neighbourhood
reverting to the simplicity nature appeared to her like
building upon an immovable basis which the clash nations
could not destroy and which was too humble to
fear the treachery courts or the caprice artificial refinement

it was all swept away in a moment our little property
looked as if it had been particularly a mark for the vengeance
 heaven and was more utterly destroyed than any
 the surrounding scenes there was not a tree left
standing there was not a hedge or a limit that remained
within or around it chaos had here resumed his empire
and avenged himself the extraordinary order and beauty
it had lately displayed
i was not overwhelmed with this astonishing spectacle
at that moment nature found her way to my heart and
made a man me i made light these petty accessories
 our existence and the thought my wife and my
children simply as they were in themselves filled every
travels st leon 
avenue my heart for them and them alone i was
interested it was a question for their lives to conceive
what they might personally have sustained was a horror
that seemed to freeze up all the arteries my heart i
descended from the mountain it was with the greatest
difficulty and not without many circuitous deviations that
i proceeded so much was the surface changed and so
deep arid miry the swamps my terror increased as i
passed near to the carcasses the animals who had fallen
victims to this convulsion the elements i observed
with inconceivable alarm that the dead or wounded bodies
 some human beings were intermingled with the brute
destruction i stayed not to enquire whether they were yet
in a state to require assistance the idea that had taken
possession me left no room for the sentiment general
humanity
a little further on i distinctly remarked the body a
woman at some distance from any habitation who appeared
to be dead destroyed by the storm near her lay a female
infant apparently about six years age my attention
was involuntarily arrested i thought louisa that sweet
and amiable child so like her admirable mother the
figure was hers j the colour the robe corresponded to
that in which i last saw her the child was lying on her
face with all the impatient emotions a father i stooped
down i turned over the body that i might identify my
child it was still warm life had scarcely deserted it i
gazed upon the visage it was distorted with the agonies 
death but enough to convince me still remained discernible
it was not louisa 
i can scarcely recollect a period through all the strange
vicissitudes my existence to be compared with this if
i had not felt what i then felt i could never have conceived
it human nature is so constituted that the highest
degree anguish an anguish in which the heart stretches
itself to take in the mightiness its woe can be felt but
for a few instants when the calamity we feared is already
arrived or when the expectation it is so certain as to
shut out hope there seems to be a principle within us by
which we look with misanthropic composure on the state
 travels st leon
to which we are reduced and the heart sullenly contracts
and accommodates itself to what it most abhorred our
hopes wither and our pride our selfcomplacence all that
taught us to rejoice in existence wither along with them
but when hope yet struggles with despair or when the calamity
abruptly announces itself then is the true contention
the tempest and uproar the soul too vast to be endured
this sentiment ineffable wretchedness i experienced
when i stooped down over the body the imaginary
louisa and when i hastened to obtain the certainty which
was all things most terrible to me the termination 
such a moment horror is scarcely less memorable than its
intrinsic greatness in an instant the soul recovers its
balance and the thought is as if it has never been i
clapped my hands in an ecstasy at once joy and astonishment
so sure did i seem to have made myself my misfortune
 i quitted the body with an unburdened heart i
flew towards my home that i might ascertain whether i
was prematurely speaking comfort to my spirit
at length i reached it i saw the happy group assembled
at the door marguerite had entertained the same
terrors for me with which i had myself so lately been impressed
we flew into each other's arms she hid her
face in my neck and sobbed audibly i embraced each 
the children in turn but louisa with the most heartfelt delight
 are you safe papa are you safe my child 
were echoed on every side a spectator unacquainted with
what was passing in our hearts would certainly have stood
astonished to see the transport with which we exulted surrounded
as we were with desolation and ruin
after an interval however we opened our eyes and began
to ruminate upon the new condition in which we were
placed marguerite and myself watched each other's countenances
with anxiety to discover what were likely to bethe
feelings either in this terrible crisis be good
heart my love said marguerite cf do not suffer the accident
which has happened entirely to overcome you there
was a mixed compassion tenderness and anxiety in the
tone voice with which she uttered these words that was
inexpressibly delightful
travels op st leon 
f no marguerite replied i with enthusiastic impetuosity
 i am not cast down i never shah be cast down
again ruin is nothing to me so long as i am surrounded
with you and our dear children i have for some time
been a fool in the midst every real blessing i have
fashioned for myself imaginary evils but my eyes are
now opened how easily is the human mind induced to
forget those benefits with which we are constantly surrounded
and our possession which we regard as secure 
the feelings this morning have awakened me i am
now cured my folly i have learned to value my domestic
blessings as i ought having preserved them i
esteem myself to have lost nothing what are gold and
jewels and precious utensils mere dross and dirt the
human face and the human heart reciprocations kindness
and love and all the nameless sympathies our nature
these are the only objects worth being attached to what
are rank and station the homage the multitude and
the applause fools let me judge for myself the value
 a man is in his intrinsic qualities in that which
power cannot strip him and which adverse fortune cannot
take away that for which he is indebted to circumstances
is mere trapping and tinsel i should love these precious
and ingenuous creatures before me better though in rags
than the children kings in all the pomp ornament i
am proud to be their father whatever may be my personal
faults the world is my debtor for having been the
occasion their existence but they are endeared to me
by a better principle than pride i love them for their qualities
he that loves and is loved by a race pure and
virtuous creatures and that lives continually in the midst 
them is an idiot if he does not think himself happy surrounded
as i am now surrounded i feel as irremovable as
the pillars creation nothing that does not strike at their
existence can affect me with terror
marguerite viewed me with surprise and joy now indeed
said she you are the man i took you for and the
man i shall henceforth be prouder than ever to call my
husband the sorrow in which you lately indulged was
a luxury and we must have done with luxuries you will
be our protector and our support
 travels op st leon
thus saying she took me by the hand and motioned
me to view with her the devastation that had been committed
there was one path i had discovered in which
we might proceed some way with tolerable ease the
scene was terrible we were indeed beggars a whole
province had been destroyed all the corn and the fruits
 the earth most the trees in many places cattle
in some places men persons who had been rich in the
morning saw all the produce their fields annihilated
and were unable even to guess by what process fertility
was to be reestablished the comparatively wealthy
scarcely knew how they were to obtain immediate subsistence
 the humbler class who always live by the expedients
 the day saw nothing before them but the prospect 
perishing with hunger we witnessed in one or two instances
the anguish their despair
our prospect was scarcely in any respect better than
theirs yet we felt differently we were more impressed
with the joy our personal escape as my error respecting
the value externals had been uncommonly great the
sudden revolution opinion i experienced was equally memorable
the survey indeed that we took the general
distress somewhat saddened our hearts but the sadness it
gave was that sobriety not dejection
it was incumbent upon us to make a strict examination
into the amount our property and our immediate resources
 and in this office i united myself with marguerite
not only with a degree cheerfulness and application the
perfect contrast my whole conduct ever since our arrival
in switzerland but which greatly exceeded any thing i had
ever before exhibited in a business this nature we
found that though all our hopes a harvest were annihilated
yet we were not destitute the instant means 
subsistence the resources we possessed whether in money
or provisions that were our dependence till the period when
the new produce should supply their place were uninjured
our implements husbandry remained s before the
land was not impoverished but had rather derived additional
fertility from the effects the storm what we
had lost was chiefly the produce our capital for one year
travels op st leon 
together with a part that capital itself in the live stock
that had been destroyed this was a loss which a certain
degree care and scope in our external circumstances
might easily have enabled us to supply but the principle
 supply was denied us it was with considerable difficulty
that all the economy marguerite had enabled her
to support our family establishment while every thing 
this kind had gone on prosperously such a shock as the
present we were totally disqualified to surmount it compelled
us to a complete revolution our affairs
many indeed our neighbours had scarcely any greater
advantage in their private affairs than ourselves but they
possessed one superiority that proved the greatest importance
in this conjuncture they were natives the state
in which they resided in the cantons switzerland the
destruction the fruits the earth occasioned by inclement
seasons and tempests is by no means unfrequent and
it is therefore customary in plentiful years to lay up corn
in public magazines that the people may not perish in periods
 scarcity these magazines are placed under the
inspection and disposal the magistracy and the inhabitants
looked to them with confidence for the supply their
need no storm however had occurred in the memory 
man so terrible and ruinous as the present and it became
evident that the magazines would prove a resource too
feeble for the extent the emergency
the storm had spread itself over a space many leagues
in circumference not only in the canton soleure but in
the neighbouring cantons particularly that berne the
sufferers in our own canton only amounted to scarcely less
than ten thousand while the women and children for
the most part remained at home the houses having in
general suffered little other damage than the destruction 
their windows the fathers families repaired to the seat
 government to put in their claims for national relief 
and these alone formed an immense troop that threatened
little less than to besiege the public magazines and the magistrates
an accurate investigation was entered into the
losses each it being the purpose government as far as
its power extended not only to supply the people with the
 travels st leon
means immediate subsistence but also by disbursements
from the public treasury to recruit the stock cattle and
to assist every one to return with revived hopes and expectation
to the sphere his industry the purpose was no
doubt benevolent but in the mean time the unhappy
victims found in uncertainty and expectation a real and
corroding anguish
i advanced my claim with the rest but met with a
peremptory refusal the harsh and rigorous answer i
received was that they had not enough for their own
people and could spare nothing to strangers upon this
occasion i was compelled to feel what it was to be an alien
and how different the condition in which i was now placed
from that i had filled in my native country there i had
lived in the midst a people to whom the veneration 
my ancestry and name seemed a part their nature they
had witnessed for several years the respectable manner in
which i lived the virtues marguerite were familiar to
them and they took an interest in every thing that concerned
us a sentiment that confessed us at once for kindred
and patrons it was the turn mind only which is
generated by rank that had compelled us to quit their
vicinity we might have continued in it if not in affluence
at least enjoying the gratifications that arise from general
affection and respect but here we were beheld with an
eye jealousy and distaste we had no prejudice birth
and habit in our favour indeed in the reverse fortune
which had brought us hither marguerite had been less desirous
 obtruding than withdrawing from the public
eye the circumstance our rank we were too recent
inmates to have secured by any thing a personal nature
an advantageous opinion among our neighbours they saw
only a miserable and distracted father a family and a
mother who in spite the simplicity she cultivated sufficiently
evinced that she had been accustomed to a more
elevated situation the prepossessions mankind are
clearly unfavourable to a newcomer an emigrant who has
quitted his former connections and the scenes his youth
they are unavoidably impelled to believe that his taking
up his abode in another country must be owing to a weak
travels op st leon 
and discreditable caprice if it be not owing to something
still more disadvantageous to his character
the calamity therefore which we had suffered in common
with most the inhabitants the province finally
reduced us to the necessity a second emigration the
jealousy with which we were regarded daily became more
visible and threatening though in consequence the
distribution made by order the state the price commodities
was not so much increased as might have been expected
we were considered as interlopers upon the portion
 the natives the sellers could with difficulty be persuaded
to accommodate us and the bystanders treated us
with murmurs and reviling while we were deliberating
what course to pursue in this emergency certain officers 
government one morning entered our habitation producing
an order the senate for our immediate removal out the
territory it is the essence coercive regulations to
expel to imprison and turn out prison the individuals
it is thought proper to control without any care as to the
mischiefs they may suffer and whether they perish under
or survive the evil inflicted on them we were accordingly
allowed only from six in the morning till noon to prepare
for our departure our guards indeed offered to permit
me to remain three days to wind up my affairs upon condition
that my wife and children were instantly removed into
another country as a sort hostages for my own departure
this indulgence however would have been useless in the
present state the country no purchaser could be found
for the little estate i possessed and if there could it must
doubtless have been disposed to great disadvantage at
such an emergency i know not how we should have extricated
ourselves out these difficulties if a member 
the senate who being one my nearest neighbours had
been struck with admiration the virtues marguerite
and with compassion for my family had not paid me a visit
shortly after the arrival the officers and generously offered
to take upon himself the care my property and to
advance me what money might be necessary for my emigration
this offer which at any other time might have
been regarded as purely a matter course under the
 travels st leon
present circumstances when capital was so necessary for
the revival agriculture in the desolated country implied
a liberal and disinterested spirit i accepted the kindness
 my neighbour in both its parts but for the reimbursement
 his loan referred him to the french minister to
the united cantons who under all the circumstances 
the case and taking my estate as security for the money
advanced i thought it reasonable to believe would attend
to my application
chapter ix
my affairs being thus far adjusted i took leave my late
habitation and set off with my wife and children the same
afternoon in the evening we arrived at basle where we
were permitted to remain that night and the next morning
were conducted in form out at the north gate the city
where our attendants quitted us with a fresh prohibition
under the severest penalties if we were found within the
ensuing twelve months in any the territories the
helvetic republic
marguerite and myself had already formed our plan
we began with dismissing both our servants an attendant
was no longer necessary to me nor a nurse for the infant
the suggestion this measure originated in myself my
temper at this time as i have already said underwent a
striking change i was resolved to be happy i was resolved
to be active it was hard to part with persons so
long familiar to us and who appeared rather in the character
 humble friends than domestics but an imperious
necessity demanded it let us said i to marguerite
increase and secure our happiness by diminishing our
wants i will be your husbandman and your labourer
you may depend upon my perseverance my education has
fitted me to endure hardship and fatigue though the hardships
then thought were a different nature you have
ever delighted in active usefulness and will not i know
travels st leon 
repine at this accumulation employment let us accommodate
ourselves to our circumstances our children i
perceive are fated to be peasants and will therefore be
eminently benefited by the example patience and independence
we shall set before them
the next object our plan related to the choice our
future place residence this originated with marguerite
she had heard much the beauty and richness the
country bordering on the lake constance and she
thought that while we denied ourselves expensive pleasures
or rather while they were placed out our reach
there would be a propriety in our procuring for ourselves a
stock those pleasures which would cost us nothing this
was a refinement beyond me and serves to evince the superiority
which marguerite's virtue and force mind still
retained over mine the virtue i had so recently adopted
was a strenuous effort i rather resolved to be happy than
could strictly be said to be happy i loved my children
indeed with an unfeigned affection it was with sincerity
that i professed to prefer them to all earthly possessions
but vanity and ostentation were habits wrought into my
soul and might be said to form part its essence i could
not but by the force constant recollection keep them out
 my wishes and hopes for the future i could not like
marguerite suffer my thoughts as it were to riot and
wanton in the pleasures poverty i could only reconcile
myself to my fate by a sort gloomy firmness the tranquillity
i seemed to have attained was an unnatural state
 my soul to which it was necessary that i should resolutely
hold myself down and from which my thoughts
appeared ever upon the alert to escape bitter experience
had at length taught me a hard lesson and that lesson i was
determined to practise whatever pangs my resignation
might cost me
we proceeded without hesitation in the direction we had
resolved to pursue our whole journey exceeded the space
 forty leagues in extent and the expense necessarily
attendant upon it our family even after its reduction
consisting no less than six persons drained our puiee
 a great part the money which had been supplied to
h 
 travels op st leon
us by the benevolent senator but he had agreed to undertake
the disposing the property we were obliged to leave
behind us and in the mean time if any considerable interval
occurred before that was accomplished to furnish us
with the sums that should be necessary for our subsistence
we placed the utmost reliance upon his fidelity and dismissed
from our minds all anxiety respecting the interval
which our banishment had interposed between us and the
resources necessary for our future settlement
upon our arrival at constance we found a letter from
our friend and though he transmitted to us no fresh supply
the complexion his communication was upon the
whole so encouraging as to determine us with no other delay
than that four days rest from our journey to pass
to the other side the lake and explore for ourselves a
situation suitable to our design the western bank the
lake with the exception only the city constance was
part the pays conquis the united cantons the eastern
bank was a territory dependent on the government that
city it was in this territory that we purposed fixing our
residence and we trusted that our affairs would shortly be
put in a train to enable us to take possession the spot we
should select
thus driven once more into flight by the pressure 
misfortune and compelled to exchange for a land unknown
the scenes which familiarity might have endeared or tender
recollections have made interesting we did not sink under
the weight our adversity this removal was not like
our last switzerland was to none us endeared like the
vales st leon i was not now goaded and tormented
by conscious guilt in the degree i had then been marguerite
was not afflicted by the spectacle my misery
our present change though it might be denominated a fall
was light in comparison with the former the composure
i had gained was new to me and had to my own mind all the
gloss novelty to my companions it proved contagious 
they were astonished at my serenity and drew from it an
unwonted lightness heart
thus circumstanced our tour had its charms for us all 
and there are few passages my life that i have felt more
travels st leon
agreeably the lake itself is uncommonly beautiful and its
environs are fertile and interesting it is surrounded with
an abundance towns villages country seats and monasteries
sufficient to adorn and diversify the view but not to
exclude the sweetness a rural scenery or the grand features
 nature we coasted a considerable part the lake
that we might judge in some degree previously to our landing
which part the shore promised best to yield us the
object we sought the autumn was now commencing the
air was liquid and sweet the foliage was rich and varied 
and the vinecovered hills exhibited a warmth and luxuriance
 colouring that no other object nature or art is
able to cope with surrounded with these objects i sat in
my boat in the midst my children and as i was but
just awakened to an observation their worth and my own
happiness i viewed them with a transport that would be ill
illustrated by being compared with the transport a miser
over his newrecovered treasure from the bowels the
deep
o poverty exclaimed i with elevated and unconquerable
emotion if these are the delights that attend thee willingly
will i resign the pomp palaces and the splendour
 rank to whoever shall deem them worth his acceptance 
henceforth i desire only to dedicate myself to the simplicity
 nature and the genuine sentiments the heart i
will enjoy the beauty scenes cultivated by other hands
than mine or that are spread out before me by the author
 the universe i will sit in the midst my children and
revel in the luxury domestic affections pleasures these
that may be incumbered but cannot be heightened by all
that wealth has in its power to bestow wealth serves no
other purpose than to deprave the soul and adulterate the
fountains genuine delight
such was the spirit exultation with which my mind
was at this time filled i am sensible that it was only
calculated to be transitory i might learn to be contented
i was not formed to be satisfied in obscurity and a low
estate
thus happy and thus amused we spent two days in
coasting the lake landing frequently for the purposes either
ii 
 travels st leon
 variety or enquiry and regularly passing the night on
shore on the evening the second day we were struck
with the neat appearance and pleasing situation a cottage
which we discovered in our rambles about a mile and a
half from the lake we found that it was to be sold and
it seemed precisely to correspond with the wishes we had
formed it was at a considerable distance from any populous
neighbourhood the nearest town being that merspure
the usual residence the bishops constance
which was distant from this spot not less than three leagues
the cottage was situated in a valley the hills being for
the most part crowned with rich and verdant foliage their
sides covered with vineyards and corn and a clear transparent
rivulet murmuring along from east to west in the
distance a few similar cottages discovered themselves and
in front there was an opening between the hills just wide
enough to show us a few sails as they floated along the now
even surface the lake we approached the cottage and
found in it only one person an interesting girl nineteen
who had resided there from her birth and had been employed
for the last four years in attendance upon the closing
scene her mother her mother had been dead only
a few weeks and she was upon the point removing as
she told us to the house a brother the best creature in
the world who was already married and had a family 
children while we were talking with her we perceived a
fine boy about eleven years age skipping along the
meadow he proved to be her nephew and hastened to
say that his father and mr henry were just behind and
would be with her in a few minutes we waited their
arrival and it was easy to see that mr henry was by no
means an indifferent object in the eyes the beautiful orphan
 she had probably conditioned that he should permit
her to remain single as long as she could be any use to
her mother the lovers were well satisfied that the girl's
brother should be taken aside that i might talk over with
him the affair the cottage we made a tour the fields
that were part the property the deceased and the
terms our intended purchase were easily adjusted
though we had now accomplished the immediate purtravels
op st leon 
pose our expedition yet as we had found unusual exhilaration
and sweetness in the objects it presented to us we
came to a resolution continuing it still further and completing
the circuit the lake we were aware that it
would be vain as yet to expect to receive the money requisite
for completing our purchase and as no pleasure
merely in the way relaxation could be more delightful
than that we were now enjoying so was it impossible
that we could fill up our time in a more frugal manner than
in this little voyage our gratification was not less but
more perfect because it consisted simple inartificial
unsought amusements the scenes around us were refreshing
and invigorating they were calculated temporarily at
least to inspire gaiety and youth into decrepitude itself
amidst these scenes we forgot our sorrows they were a
kind stream in which weariness and dejection plunged
their limbs and came forth untired and alert they
awakened in the mind all its most pleasing associations
having already as we believed chosen the place our
future residence we busied ourselves in imagining ah the
accompaniments that would grow out it we determined
that poverty with health would not fail to be attended
with its portion pleasures the scenes nature were
all our own nor could wealth give them a more perfect
or a firmer appropriation the affections and charities 
habitude and consanguinity we trusted we should feel uninterrupted
unincumbered with the ceremonies and trappings
 life and in that rural plainness which is their
genial soil
after a leisurely and delightful voyage six days we
returned to constance we expected to have found on our
return some further intelligence from the beneficent senator
but in this we were disappointed the imagination however
easily suggested to us a variety circumstances that
might have delayed the business he had undertaken and
it was no forced inference to suppose that he deferred writing
because he had nothing important to communicate
at first therefore we suffered little uneasiness from the
delay but as time proceeded and the silence our protector
continued the affair began to assume a more serious
h 
 travels op st leon
aspect the little stock we had brought with us in our
exile was in a rapid progress decay we had managed
it with frugality though not at first with that anxious solicitude
the necessity which we now began to apprehend
we had procured for ourselves two small and inconvenient
apartments in an obscure alley the city constance
we were in the act meditating what steps it would be
necessary to take in this unfortunate emergency when intelligence
was brought us the sudden decease the
person upon whose kindness and exertions we depended
he was succeeded in his estate by his nephew a man 
whom we had heard something during our residence in the
neighbourhood and whose habits we understood to be diametrically
the reverse his predecessor's in short he
had been represented to us as illiberal morose selfish and
litigious a man who having suffered in one part his
life the hardships poverty scrupled no means honourable
or otherwise removing it to the greatest practicable
distance he had already reaped the succession some weeks
when we heard the event that put him in possession 
it and the letters which i had more than once addressed
to our protector had probably fallen into his hands these
circumstances afforded no favourable augury the treatment
we might expect from him the first thing which
seemed proper was to write to him which i accordingly
did i acquainted him with the nature the transaction
between myself and his uncle and signified how necessary
it was that we should come to a conclusion as speedily as
possible i represented to him pathetically the condition
to which i was born and the opulence in which i had
passed many years my life together with the contrast
afforded by the present reduced and urgent circumstances
 my family i entreated him to exert his generosity and
justice in behalf an unfortunate exile whom untoward
events had deprived the power doing justice to himself

to this letter i received no answer uncertain as to the
cause my correspondent's silence or even whether my
letter had been received i wrote again my heart was
wrung with this new adversity i was forbidden under
travels op st leon 
pain perpetual imprisonment to return to the territories
 the republic and i had no friend to solicit in my behalf
in constance i was utterly a stranger in switzerland my
unfortunate habits life the depression and solitude in
which i had been merged deprived me the opportunity
 forming connections the deceased was the only person
who had been disposed to interfere for me it was too
probable that the silence his successor was an indication
 the hostility his views i saw nothing before me but
the prospect my family perishing with want deprived
 their last resource exiles and penniless thus destitute
and forlorn what could we do to what plan could we have
recourse we had not so much as the means providing
ourselves with the implements the humblest labour if
we had could i under my circumstances resolve upon
this could i give up the last slender pittance my
children while there was a chance recovering it and by
surrendering them to the slavery perpetual labour devote
them to the lowest degree ignorance and degradation 
no i still clung to this final hope and was resolved to
undertake any thing however desperate rather than part
with it such were my feelings and in the new letter
which i now despatched i poured out all the anguish 
my soul
a reply to this letter was at length vouchsafed the
heir my protector informed me that he knew nothing 
the business to which i alluded that he had come into
possession the lands i described together with the other
property his late uncle and regarded himself as holding
them by the same tenure that he found in the accounts 
the estate a sum money advanced to me which he might
with the strictest justice regard as a debt and pursue me
for it accordingly he should be liberal enough however
so far to give credit to my story and to consider the sum
in question as advanced upon a pledge land in that case
i might regard myself as sufficiently fortunate in having
obtained even that amount at a time when but for the humanity
or weakness his uncle my estate would not have
sold for a farthing meanwhile the forbearance which he
proffered would he observed depend upon my conduct and
 travels st leon
be retracted if i afforded him cause for resentment he
added that he despised my menaces and commands and
that if i took a single step against him i should find it
terminate in my utter ruin
nothing could be more profligate than the style his
letter but its impotence was equal to its wickedness it
was absurd to threaten to inflict ruin on a man whom ruin
had already overtaken before the letter arrived i had
disbursed the whole sum i brought with me from switzerland
this entire annihilation my resources seemed to
steal on me unperceived finding that all reply to my
importunity was either refused or deferred to an uncertain
period i would willingly at all risks have sought the villain
who thus obdurately devoted me and my family to destruction
and have endeavoured to obtain justice in person but
it was now too late before i felt the case thus desperate
my finances were so far reduced as to make it impracticable
for me to leave my wife and children enough to support
them in my absence even if i had determined myself to
set out upon this perilous expedition penny less i resolved
that if we did perish we would perish together
penury was now advancing upon us with such rapid
strides that the lowest and most scanty resources no longer
admitted neglect had a case thus desperate been encountered
with timely attention it is not improbable that
some the various talents i had acquired in the course 
my education would have furnished me with a means 
subsistence not altogether plebeian or incompetent but
with the uncertainty my situation and totally unaccustomed
as i was to regard my person or mind as a machine
fitted for productive labour i had not looked to this question
till the urgency the case deprived me every advantage
i might otherwise have seized i was glad therefore
to have recourse to menial occupation and sought
employment under the gardener the episcopal palace for
whose service i was sufficiently qualified by my ten years
retreat in the bordelois that i might better adapt myself
to the painful necessity my situation i previously exchanged
some my own clothes for garments more suitable
to the business i now solicited it was not till i had artravels
 st leon 
rived within a very few days to the my resources
that even this expedient hy a sort accident recurred to
my mind marguerite though fully aware the urgency
 the case had as she afterwards told me imposed on
herself a compulsory silence fearing for the inflamed and
irritated frame my mind and aware that the course 
events would ultimately lead me to a point with which she
dreaded to intermeddle this was for her a trying moment
 my lately recovered insanity obliging her to contemplate
in silence our growing distress and to wait the attack
 hunger and want that threatened to destroy us with an
apparent tranquillity and cheerfulness
for me so entire a revolution had taken place in my
sentiments that i spurned with contempt so far as related
to myself that pride rank and romantic gallantry 
honour which had formerly been my idols i submitted
with a sort gloomy contentment to the situation upon
which my destiny drove me i regarded it as the natural
result my former misconduct and derived a sentiment 
ease and relief from thus expiating as it were with the
sweat my brow the temptations to which i had yielded
had i been myself only reduced thus low or had the produce
 my labour been sufficient to purchase competence
for my wife and the means instruction for my family i
can safely affirm that i should have found no consequence
so direct from my own degradation as the means silencing
the reproaches conscience and reconciling me to myself
but when i returned in the evening with the earnings 
my day's labour and found it incompetent to the procuring
for those who depended on me the simplest means subsistence
then indeed my sensations were different my
heart died within me i did not return after the fatigues
 the day which to me who had not been accustomed to
unremitted labour and who now began to feel that i was
not so young as i had been at the siege pavia were extremely
trying i did not return i say to a night 
repose i became a very woman when i looked forward
and endeavoured to picture to myself the future situation 
my family i watered my pillow with my tears often
when i imagined that my whole family were asleep i gave
 travels st leon
vent to my perturbed and distracted mind in groans 
marguerite would sometimes overhear me and with the
gentlest suggestions her admirable mind would endeavour
to soothe my thoughts to peace for the present as
i have said my earnings were incompetent and we found
it necessary to supply the deficiency by the sale the few
garments not in immediate use that we still possessed
what then would be the case when these were gone and
when in addition to this it would be necessary to purchase
not only food to eat and a roof to shelter but also
clothes to cover us 
chapter x
these deficiencies i anxiously anticipated but there was
another evil upon which i had not calculated that was still
hearer and more overwhelming the mode life in which
i was now engaged so different from any thing to which i
had been accustomed excessive fatigue together with the
occasional heat the weather the uneasiness my mind
and the sleeplessness my nights all combined to throw
me into a fever which though it did not last long had
raged so furiously during the period its continuance as
to leave me in a state the most complete debility while
the disorder was upon me i was sensible my danger 
and as the brilliant and consolatory prospects life seemed
for ever closed upon me i at first regarded my approaching
dissolution with complacency and longed to be released
from a series woes in which i had been originally involved
by my own folly this frame mind however
was no great duration the more nearly i contemplated
the idea separation from those i loved the smaller was
my resignation i was unwilling to quit those dear objects
by which i still held to this mortal scene i shrunk with
aversion from that barrier which separates us from all that
is new mysterious and strange another train ideas
succeeded this and i began to despise myself for my impa
travels st leon
thence and cowardice it was by my vices that my family
was involved in a long train misfortunes could i shrink
from partaking what i had not feared to create the
greater were the adversities for which they were reserved
the more ought i to desire to suffer with them i had
already committed the evil in what remained it was reasonable
to suppose i should prove their benefactor and
not their foe it was incumbent on me to soothe and to
animate them to enrich their minds with cheerfulness and
courage and to set before them an example philosophy
and patience by my faculties industry i was their
principal hope and whatever we might suffer combined
it was probable their sufferings would be infinitely greater
if deprived my assistance these reflections gave me
energy and it seemed as if the resolute predilection i had
conceived for life contributed much to my recovery
one thing which strongly confirmed the change my
mind underwent in this respect was a conversation that
i overheard at a time when i was supposed to be completely
in a state insensibility but when though i was too
much reduced to give almost any tokens life my faculties
 hearing and understanding what passed around me were
entire charles came up to my bedside laid his hand
upon mine as if to feel the state the skin and with a
handkerchief that was near wiped away the moisture that
bedewed my face he had been fitted for many nurselike
offices by the unwearied attention he had exerted towards
me in the paroxysm my insanity having finished his
task he withdrew from the bed and burst into tears his
mother came up to him drew him to the furthest part 
the room and in a low voice began the conversation
do my dear boy go down stairs and get yourself
something to eat you see your papa is quiet now
i am afraid that will not last long and then he will be
so restless and toss about so it is dreadful to see him
i will watch charles and let you know
indeed mamma i cannot eat now i will by and
by
you must try to eat charles or else you will make
yourself quite ill if you were ill too it would be more
than i could support
 travels st leon
i will not be ill mamma i assure you i will not
but besides that i have no stomach i cannot bear to eat
when there is hardly enough for my sisters
eat boy do not trouble yourself about that we
shall get more when that is gone god is good and will
take care us
i know that god is good but for all that one must
not expect to have every thing one wishes though god
is good there are dreadful misfortunes in the world and i
suppose we shall have our share them
come charles though you are but a boy you are the
best boy in the world you are now almost my only
comfort but you will not be able to comfort me if you do
not take care yourself
dear mamma do you know mamma i heard that
naughty man below stairs count up last night how much
rent you owed him for and swear you should not stay any
longer if you did not pay him if i were a little bigger i
would talk to him so that he should not dare to insult us in
our distress but not being big enough i opened the
door and went into the room and begged him for god's
sake not to add to your distress and though he is so
ugly i took hold his hand and kissed it but it felt
like iron which put me in mind his iron heart and
i cried ready to burst with mortification ha did not say
hardly a word
he must be paid charles he shall be paid
 do you know mamma as soon as i left him i went
to the bishop's gardens and spoke to the gardener i
asked him if he had heard that my papa was ill and he
said he had he said too he was very sorry and wanted
to know what hand we made it for want the wages i
told him we were sadly off and the man the house had
just been affronting me about his rent but said i cannot
you give me something to do to weed or to rake i
can dig a little too and scatter seed he asked if i knew
weeds from flowers oh that i do said i well then
said he there is not much you can do but you are a good
boy and i will put you on the bishop's list but now
mamma i have not the heart to work till i see whether
papa will get well again
travels st leon ill
while poor charles told his artless tale marguerite wept
over him and kissed him again and again she called him
the best child in the world and said that if i were hut so
fortunate as to recover with such a husband and such a son
she should yet be the happiest women
oh my poor father exclaimed charles ever
since the great hailstorm i have every hour loved him
better than before i thought that was impossible but he is
so gentle so kind so goodhumoured and so patient i
loved him when he was harsh and when he was out his
mind but nothing so well then as i have done since
people that are kind and smile always do one good but
nobody's smiles are like my father's it makes me cry
with joy sometimes when i do but think them pray
papa added he coming up to the bedside and whispering
yet with a hurried and passionate accent get well 
do but get well and we will be so happy never was
there a family so happy or so loving as we will be i
while he spoke thus i endeavoured to put out my hand
but i could not i endeavoured to smile but i was unable 
my heart was in a feeble yet soothing tranquillity the
accents love i had heard dwelt upon my memory they
had talked distress but the sentiment love was uppermost
in my recollection i was too weak frame to suffer
intellectual distress no accents but those which carried
balm to my spirit seemed capable resting upon my ear
from this hour i regularly grew better and as i recovered
seemed to feel more and more vividly how enviable
it was to be the head a loving and harmonious
family
my recovery however was exceedingly slow and it was
several weeks before i had so far recruited my strength as
to be capable my ordinary occupations in the meantime
the pecuniary difficulties to which we were exposed
hourly increased and the cheerful but insignificant labours
 charles could contribute little to the support a family
the melancholy nature our situation might perhaps
have been expected to prevent the restoration my health
at first however it had not that effect the debilitated
state my animal functions led me by a sort irresisu
 travels op st leon
able instinct to reject ideas and reflections which i thou
then have been unable to endure i saw the anxiety and
affection my family and i was comforted i saw the
smiles marguerite and i seemed insensible to the languor
the saddened cheerfulness they expressed i did not
perceive that while i was provided with every thing necessary
in my condition my family were in want the very
bread that should sustain existence
my health in the mean time improved and my perceptions
became proportionably clearer symptoms desolation
and famine though as much as possible covered from
my sight obtruded themselves and were remarked one
day in particular i observed various tokens this nature in
silence and with that sort bewildered understanding
which at once labours for comprehension and resists belief
the day closed and what i had perceived pressed upon my
mind and excluded sleep now for the first time i exerted
myself to recollect in a methodical way the state 
my affairs for the severity my illness had at length
succeeded to banish from me all ideas and feelings but what
related to the sensations it produced and to the objects
around me and it was not without effort that i could once
more fully call to mind the scenes in which i had been
engaged the truth then by regular degrees rose completely
to view and i began to be astonished that my poor
wife and children had been able in any manner to get
through the horrible evils to which they must have been
exposed this thought i revolved in my mind for near
two hours and the longer i dwelt upon it the more perturbed
and restless i grew at length it became impossible
for me to hold my contemplations pent up in my own bosom
i turned to marguerite and asked her whether she
were asleep
she answered in the negative she had been remarking
my restlessness and tenderly enquired respecting its
cause
how long said i is it since i was taken with the
fever 
a month tomorrow replied she it was the
most malignant and distressing kind while it lasted and
travels st leon 
i did not expect you to live but ithas left you a fortnight
 and i hope reginald you find yourself getting
strong again
 and so we are here in constance and we have left
switzerland 
 three months my love 
i remember very well the letter we received from monsieur
grimseld has any further intelligence reached us from
that quarter 
none
none no supply any kind has reached you 
my dear reginald talk something else you will
soon i hope be well our children are all alive and the
calamity that has not succeeded to separate us or to diminish
our circle love even by a single member we will
learn to bear let us fix our attention on the better prospects
that open before us 
stay marguerite i have other questions to ask before
you require me to bear the calamities that have overtaken
us let me understand what these calamities are
while we waited for intelligence from switzerland we expended
the whole sum that we brought with us and i was
obliged to hire myself to the episcopal gardener for bread 
was it not so 
indeed reginald you are to blame pray question
me no further 
f this was our condition some time ago and now fora
month past i have been incapable labour marguerite
what have you done 
indeed my love i have been too anxious for you to
think much any thing else we had still some things
you know that we could contrive to do without and those
i have sold charles too our excellenthearted son has
lately hired himself to the gardener and has every night
brought us home a little though it was but little
 i am sorry you must wait but
you must learn to have patience
do you know papa i walked in the garden before
breakfast and so not thinking any thing i came to
the summerhouse and i tried to open the door but i
could not j found it was locked so i thought julia
was there and i knocked and called julia but nobody
answered so then i knew julia was not there for i was
sure she would have opened the door so i climbed upon
the stump the peartree and tried to look in at the window
 but the shutters were shut and i could not get to see
over the top them and i walked all round the summerhouse
and all the shutters were shut papa i wish
you would not let a man get into the summerhouse who
 travels st leon
shuts all the shutters and locks the door you always
used to let me go into every room i liked and do you
know i think none but bad people lock and bolt themselves
up so it puts mind the giants with their drawbridges
and their pitfalls i shall be quite afraid this frightful old
man
this prattle the child was nothing yet it increased
the embarrassment my situation and made the peculiarity
 the case more conspicuous finding her pertinacious
in insisting upon a topic that was disagreeable tome
her mother called her from me and put her upon some
occupation that served to divert her attention i felt like
a person that was guilty some crime and this consideration
and kindness my wife when i seemed to myself to
deserve her reproach had not the power to calm my
uneasiness
these little occurrences appeared like the beginning 
a separation interests and estrangement hearts i
tasked myself severely i summoned the whole force 
my mind that i might strictly consider what it was in
which i was about to engage if this slight and casual
hint a secret is felt by both marguerite and myself with
so much uneasiness and embarrassment what will be our
situation if i go on to accept the stranger's confidence and
become the depository an arcanum so important as he
represents his to be he declares himself able to bestow
upon me the highest opulence what will be the feelings 
my wife and children when they see my condition suddenly
changed from its present humble appearance to splendour
and wealth without being able to assign the source this
extraordinary accession 
it is difficult to conceive a family picture more enviable
that than to which i was now continually present and 
which i formed a part we had been happy on the banks
 the garonne and we had pictured to ourselves a plan 
happiness immediately on our arrival in the city constance
but these were little and imperfect compared with
what i now enjoyed in the first situation my children
were infants and in the second the eldest was but ten years
 age the mother was now thirtyfive and she had
travels st leon 
lost in my eyes at least none her personal attractions
her intellectual accomplishments were much greater than
ever her understanding was matured her judgment decided
her experience more comprehensive as she had a
greater compass materials to work upon her fancy was
more playful her conversation richer and her reflections
more amusing and profound the matron character she
had acquired had had no other effect on her feelings than
to render them more deep more true and magnetical her
disposition was more entirely affectionate than it had been
even in the first year our cohabitation her attachment
to her children was exemplary and her vigilance uninterrupted
 and for myself she was accustomed in all that
related to our mutual love to enter into my sentiments and
inclinations with so just a tone equality and kindness
that we seemed to be two bodies animated by a single soul
if the mother were improved the children were still more
improved in their early years we are attached to our offspring
merely because they are ours and in a way that has
led superficial speculators to consider the attachment less as
the necessary operation a sensible and conscious mind
than as a wise provision nature for the perpetuation 
the species but as they grow up the case is different
our partiality is then confirmed or diminished by qualities
visible to an impartial bystander as really as to ourselves
they then cease to be merely the objects our solicitude
and become our companions the partners our sentiments
and the counsellors our undertakings such at least was
my case at the present period charles who was now
sixteen was manly beyond his years while the native fire
 his disposition was tempered by adversity by an humble
situation and by the ardour filial and fraternal affection
julia who was two years younger became daily more interesting
by the mildness her disposition and the tenderness
 her sensibility louisa was only twelve but as
she was extremely notable and had an uncommonly quick
and accurate spirit imitation she rendered herself exceedingly
useful to her mother marguerite the plaything
and amusement the family had as i have said just
completed the eighth year her age

one exquisite source gratification when it is not a
source uneasiness to speak from my own experience
which a parent finds in the society his children is their
individuality they are not puppets moved with wires
and to be played on at will almost from the hour their
birth they have a will their own to be consulted and
negotiated with we may say to them as adam to the
general mother mankind but now thou wert flesh

and reason a living being to be regarded with attention
and deference to be courted not compelled susceptible 
the various catalogue human passions capable resentment
and gratitude indignation and love perverseness
and submission it is because thou art thus
formed that i love thee i cannot be interested about objects
inanimate or brute i require a somewhat that shall
exercise my judgment and awaken my moral feelings it
is necessary to me to approve myself and be approved by
another i rejoice to stand before you at once the defendant
and the judge i rejoice in the restraint to which your
independent character subjects me and it will be my pride
to cultivate that independence in your mind i would negotiate
for your affections and confidence and not be loved
by you but in proportion as i shall have done something
to deserve it i could not congratulate myself upon your
correspondence to my wishes if it had not been in your
power to withhold it
while i indulge this vein reflection i seem again to
see my family as they surrounded me in the year fifteen
hundred and fortyfour marguerite the partner my life
charles the brother my cares the blooming julia the
sage louisa and the playful cadette the family how
richly furnished how cheerful how heart reviving appeared
to me the apartment in which they were assembled i
dwell upon the image with fond affection and lingering delight
where are they now how has all this happiness
been maliciously undermined and irrevocably destroyed 
to look back on it it seems like the idle fabric a dream
i awake and find myself alone were there really such
travels st leon 
persons where are they dispersed whither are they
gone oh miserable solitude and desertion to which i
have so long been condemned i see nothing around me
but speechless walls or human faces that say as little to my
heart as the walls themselves how palsied is my soul 
how withered my affections but i will not anticipate
chapter xii
i carried food to the stranger as occasion required in the
course the day he seemed indisposed to speak and we
exchanged scarcely more than two or three words the
next morning was the implied time to which the question
 his confidence was deferred and i went to him with the
full resolution refusing it whether it were that he
discerned this resolution in my countenance or that in the
interval that elapsed he had formed a meaner opinion 
my character and thought me unfit for the purposes he intended
i should answer certain it is that he anticipated me
at the same time he magnified the importance the gifts
he had to communicate he expressed himself astonished
at the precipitateness his yesterday's conduct it was
not till after much trial and long probation that he could
choose himself a confidant i was not at present fit for the
character nor perhaps ever should be the talent he possessed
was one upon which the fate nations and the
human species might be made to depend god had given
it for the best and highest purposes and the vessel in
which it was deposited must be purified from the alloy 
human frailty it might be abused and applied to the
most atrocious designs it might blind the understanding

might overturn kingdoms and change the whole order 
human society into anarchy and barbarism it might
render its possessor the universal plague or the universal
tyrant mankind
go st leon added the stranger you are not quae

travels op st leon
lifted for so important a trust you are not yet purged 
imbecility and weakness though you have passed through
much and had considerable experience you are yet a child
i had heard your history and expected to find you a different
man go and learn to know yourself for what you are
frivolous and insignificant worthy to have been born a
peasant and not fitted to adorn the rolls chivalry or the
rank to which you were destined 
there was something so impressive in the rebuke and
contempt this venerable sage that made it impossible to
contend with them never was there a man more singular
and in whom were united greater apparent contradictions
observe him in a quiet and unanimated moment you might
almost take him for a common beggar a poor miserable
wretch in whom life lingered and insensate stupidity
reigned but when his soul was touched in any those
points on which it was most alive he rose at once and appeared
a giant his voice was the voice thunder and
rolling in a rich and sublime swell it arrested and stilled
while it withered all the nerves the soul his eyebeam
sat upon your countenance and seemed to look through you
you wished to escape from its penetrating power but you
had not the strength to move i began to feel as if it were
some mysterious and superior being in human form and
not a mortal with whom i was concerned
what a strange and contradictory being is man i had
gone to the summerhouse this morning with a firm resolution
to refuse the gifts and the communication the
stranger i felt as if lightened from a burthen which the
whole preceding day had oppressed me while i formed this
resolution i was cheerful and conscious rectitude and
strength mind how cheaply we prize a gift which we
imagine to be already in our power with what philosophical
indifference do we turn it on every side depreciate
its worth magnify its disadvantages and then pique ourselves
upon the sobriety and justice the estimate we have
made thus it was with me in the present transaction 
but when i had received the check the stranger and
saw the proposed benefit removed to a vast and uncertain
distance then it resumed all its charms then the contrast
travels st leon 
 wealth and poverty flashed full upon my soul before
i had questioned the reality the stranger's pretensions
and considered whether he might not be an artful impostor
but now all was clearness and certainty the advantages 
wealth passed in full review before my roused imagination
i saw horses palaces and their furniture i saw the splendour
 exhibition and the trains attendants objects
which had been for ever dear to my puerile imagination i
contemplated the honour love obedience troops friends
which are so apt to attend upon wealth when disbursed
with a moderate degree dignity and munificence when
i compared this with my present poverty and desertion the
meanness our appearance our daily labours the danger
that an untoward accident might sink us in the deepest distress
and the hopelessness that my son or his posterity
should ever rise to that honour and distinction to which they
had once been destined the effect was too powerful
another feeling came still further in aid this it was
the humiliating impression which the stranger had left upon
my mind this seemed to be his great art if in reality his
conduct is to be imputed to art there is no enemy to
virtue so fatal as a sense degradation selfapplause is
our principal support in every liberal and elevated act 
virtue if this ally can be turned against us if we can be
made to ascribe baseness effeminacy want spirit and
adventure to our virtuous resolutions we shall then indeed
feel ourselves shaken this was precisely my situation 
the figure i made in my own eyes was mean i was impatient
 my degradation i believed that i had shown
myself uxorious and effeminate at a time that must have
roused in me the spirit a man if there had been a spark
 manly spirit latent in my breast this impatience cooperated
with the temptations the stranger and made me
anxious to possess what he offered to my acceptance
i reasoned thus with myself what excites my scruples is
simply the idea having one single secret from my wife
and family this scruple is created by the singular and
unprecedented confidence in which we have been accustomed
to live other men have their secrets nor do they
find their domestic tranquillity broken by that circumstance
 travels st leon
the merchant does not call his wife into consultation upon
his ventures the statesman does not unfold to her his policy
and his projects the warrior does not take her advice upon
the plan his campaign the poet does not concert with
her his flights and his episodes to other men the domestic
scene is the relaxation their cares when they enter it
they dismiss the business the day and call another cause
i only have concentrated in it the whole my existence
by this means i have extinguished in myself the true energy
 the human character a man can never be respectable
in the eyes the world or in his own except so far as he
stands by himself and is truly independent he may have
friends he may have domestic connections but he must
not in these connections lose his individuality nothing
truly great was ever achieved that was not executed or
planned in solitary seclusion
but if these reasons are sufficient to prove that the plan
i have lately pursued is fundamentally wrong how much
more will the importance what is proposed by the stranger
plead my excuse for deviating from it how bitterly have
i lamented the degradation my family shall i not
seize this opportunity reinstalling them in their hereditary
honours i deemed the ruin i had brought upon
them irreparable shall i not embrace the occasion 
atoning for my fault no man despises wealth who fully
understands the advantages it confers does it not confer the
means cultivating our powers does it not open to us
the career honour which is shut against the unknown
and obscure does it not conciliate the prepossessions 
mankind and gain for us an indulgent and liberal construction
 does it not inspire us with graceful confidence
and animate us to generous adventure the poor man is
denied every advantage education and wears out his life
in labour and ignorance from offices trust from opportunities
 distinction he is ignominiously thrust aside 
and though he should sacrifice his life for the public cause
he dies unhonoured and unknown if by any accident he
comes into possession those qualities which when discerned
and acknowledged command the applause mankind
who will listen to him his appearance is mean 
travels st leon 
and the fastidious auditor turns from him ere half his words
are uttered he has no equipage and attendants no one
to blow the trumpet before him and proclaim his rank 
how can he propose any thing that shall be worthy attention
 aware the prepossession mankind in this
respect he is alarmed and overwhelmed with confusion
before he opens his lips filled with the conscience his
worth he anticipates the unmerited contempt that is prepared
to oppress him and his very heart dies within him
add to these circumstances the constitution our nature
the various pleasures which it is adapted to partake and
how many these pleasures it is in the power wealth to
procure yes an object like this will sufficiently apologise forme
to those for whose sake alone it was estimable in my sight
it is indeed nothing but our poverty and the lowness 
our station that have thus produced in us an habitual and
unreserved communication sentiments wealth would
to a certain degree destroy our contact and take off the
wonder that we had each our thoughts that were not put
into the common stock
these considerations decided my choice i was not indeed
without some variations mind and some compunction
 heart for the resolution i had espoused the longer
the stranger remained with me the more evident it was
that there was something mysterious between us and the
unreserved affection and union that had lately reigned under
my roof suffered materially the effects it the stranger
had been led to my cottage in the first instance by the entire
solitude in which it was placed there was nothing
about which he was so solicitous as concealment the most
atrocious criminal could not be more alarmed at the idea 
being discovered i was unable to account for this but i was
now too anxious for his stay and the promised reward not
to be alert in gratifying all his wishes the most inviolable
secresy therefore was enjoined to the whole family and
the younger branches it particularly the little marguerite
it was necessary to keep almost immured to prevent the
danger their reporting any thing out the house that
might be displeasing to the stranger and fatal to my expectations
upon the whole my situation was eminently
 travels op st leon
an uneasy one no experiment can be more precarious than
that a halfconfidence and nothing but the sincere affection
that was entertained for me could have rendered it
successful in this instance my family felt that they were
trusted by me only in points where it was impossible to
avoid it and that i was not therefore properly entitled to
their cooperation i was conscious ingratitude in
making them no return for their fidelity they kept my
secret because they were solicitous to oblige me not from
any conviction that they were conferring on me a benefit 
but on the contrary suspecting that the object as to which
they were blindly assisting me would prove injurious tome
as well as to themselves
the health the stranger visibly declined but this was
a circumstance which he evidently regarded with complacency
it was the only source consolation which he
appeared susceptible his mind was torn with painful remembrances
and agitated with terrible forebodings he
abhorred solitude and yet found no consolation in society
i could not be much with him my duty to my family
who were principally supported by my labour was a call
too imperious to be neglected even when i was with him
he commonly testified no desire for conversation stay
with me he was accustomed to say give me as much 
your time as you can but do not talk upon these occasions
he would sit sometimes with his arms folded and
with the most melancholy expression imaginable he would
then knit his brows wring his hands with a sadness that
might have excited pity in the hardest breast or with both
hands closed the one clasping the other strike himself impatiently
on the forehead at other times he would rise
from his seat pace the room with hurried and unquiet
steps and then again throw himself on his couch in the
greatest agitation his features were often convulsed with
agony often have i wiped away the sweat which would
suddenly burst out in large drops on his forehead at
those seasons he would continually mutter words to himself
the sense which it was impossible for me to collect i
could perceive however that he often repeated the names
 clara henry a wife a friend a friend 
travels st leon
and then he would groan as if his heart were bursting
sometimes in the midst these recollections he would
pass the back his hand over his eyes and then looking
at it shaking his head and biting his under lip exclaim
with a piteous accent dry dry all the moisture 
my frame is perished then as if recovering himself he
would cry with a startled and terrified voice who is there
st leon come to me let me feel that there is a
human being near me i often call for you but i find
myself alone deserted friendless friendless 
at times when his recollection was more complete he
would say i know i tire you why should i tire you 
what gratification can it be to me to occasion emotions 
disgust upon these occasions i endeavoured to soothe
him and assured him i found pleasure in administering to
his relief but he replied no no do not flatter me 
it is long since i have heard the voice flattery i never
loved it no i know i am precluded from ever exciting
friendship or sympathy why am i hot dead why do i
live a burthen to myself useful to none my secret i
could almost resolve should die with me but you have
earned and you shall receive it
the stranger was not always in this state extreme anguish
nor always indisposed to converse he had lucid
intervals and could beguile the sorrow his heart with
social communication we sometimes talked various
sciences and branches learning he appeared to be well
informed in them all his observations were ingenious 
his language copious his illustrations fanciful and picturesque
 his manner bold and penetrating it was easy
to observe in him the marks a vigorous and masculine
genius sometimes we discussed the events at that time
going on in the world when we discoursed events that
had passed and persons that had died more than a century
before the stranger often spoke them in a manner as if
he had been an eyewitness and directly acquainted with
the objects our discourse this i ascribed to the vividness
 his conceptions and the animation his language
he however often checked himself in this peculiarity and
always carefully avoided what could lead to any thing per
 travels op st leon
sonal to himself i described to him the scenes my youth
and related my subsequent history he on his part was
invincibly silent on every circumstance his country his
family and his adventures
the longer i was acquainted with him the more my curiosity
grew i was restless and impatient to learn something
respecting a man who thus wrapped himself up in
mystery and reserve often i threw out as it were a line
by which to fathom his secret i talked various countries
i mentioned different kinds calamities and even crimes
that by some incidental allusion i might discover at unawares
his country his connections or the nature his
story when any thing that offered seemed to lead to the
desired point i doubled my questions and endeavoured to
construct them with the skill a crafty litigant in a court
 justice there were some subjects the very mention 
which gave him uneasiness and upon which he immediately
silenced me but these were not themselves enough to
afford me a clue or to furnish materials out which forme
to construct the history the stranger he did not
always perceive the drift my questions and snares but
ashen he did he generally became loud resentful and
furious there was nothing else that so completely roused
his indignation
st leon said he to me one day silence this inquisitive
temper yours check your rash and rude curiosity
the only secret i have that can be any importance
to you you shall one day know but my country my
family my adventures i have once told you and i tell
you again you shall never know that knowledge can be
 moment to no one and it shall never be disclosed when
this heart ceases to beat that tale shall cease to have a place
on the face the earth why should my distresses and
disgraces be published to any one is it not enough that
they have lacerated my bosom that they have deprived me
 friends that they have visited me with every adversity
and every anguish that they have bowed me down to the
earth that they have made thought and remembrance and
life itself a burthen too heavy to be borne your present
injudicious conduct if persisted in will have the effect 
travels op st leon 
driving me from your roof turning me once more upon
the world upon that world that i hate upon that world
whose bruises and ill treatment i feel in every fibre my
frame j exposing me again to fresh persecutions and
causing me to perish miserably in a dungeon or die upon
a scaffold spare me my generous host i know you are
capable generosity indeed i have endured enough to
satiate the rage malice itself you see what i suffer from
the rage and tempest my own thoughts even without the
assistance any external foe let me die in that degree 
tranquillity i am able to attain i will not trouble you long
at another time he addressed me in a different style
 you see st leon that the anguish mind i endure is
such as is ordinarily attributed to the recollection great
crimes and you have very probably conjectured that in my
case it arises from the same source if you have i forgive
you but i assure you that you are mistaken take from
yourself that uneasiness if it has ever visited you you
are not giving sanctuary to a villain i am innocent i
can take no crime to my charge i have suffered more
almost than man ever suffered but i have sinned little
the cause my uneasiness and prime source all my
misfortunes i dare not disclose to you be contented with
the plan my conduct i have digested my purpose i
have determined where to speak and where to be silent
the more i saw this man the more strange and unaccountable
appeared to me every thing that related to him
why was he so poor possessing as he pretended inexhaustible
wealth why was he unhappy with so great
talents and genius and such various information why
was he friendless being as he solemnly assured me so perfectly
innocent and consequence so respectable that
he was an impostor every thing that i saw him forbade
me to believe his sorrows were too profound and excruciating
for it to be possible for me to rank them among
the actions that a man may play the greatness his
powers the dignity his carriage the irresistible appearance
 sincerity that sparkled in his eye and modulated
his voice fully convinced me that he really was what he
pretended to be i had heard men who under the prest
travels op st leon
hence alchemy fastened themselves upon persons possessing
sums money and beguiling them with a delusive
expectation wealth reduced them to beggary and ruin
one such person i had had a brief connection with during
my residence in the bordelois though finding the incident
by no means essential to the progress my history i have
passed it over together with many others in silence but
nothing could be more unlike than that man and the person
respecting whom i was now concerned in reality i possessed
at that time if i may be allowed to say so a more
than common insight into the characters mankind so as
to be little likely except under the tyranny passion as
in the instance gaming to be made the prey imposition
i had studied my species as it exhibits itself in history
and had mixed with it in various scenes and under
dissimilar aspects i had accordingly in the transaction i
have just alluded to soon detected the plans the villain
who expected to delude me but what could be the purpose
 the stranger in this respect the pretended alchemist
in france had obtained a certain sum money me
and demanded more the stranger never made such a demand
 me and perfectly knew that even if i had been
inclined i was not able to supply him the alchemist
had amused me with descriptions various processes for
the transmutation metals had exhibited his crucibles and
retorts and employed a sort dramatic coup d'aeil for the
purpose awakening my curiosity and stimulating my
passions the stranger had simply stated in the plainest
and most direct manner that it was in his power to enrich
me but had been silent as to the manner producing the
wealth he promised and had abstained from every effort to
intoxicate my mind i felt therefore in this instance the
effect that without being able to solve the difficulties and
contrarieties that hung about him i yet believed his assertions
 nor was the inscrutability his history and his motives
capable shaking my confidence
one day during the period his concealment certain
officers the bishop constance accompanied by a foreigner
in a neapolitan habit came to my house and as
it proved with the express purpose searching for the
travels st leon 
man who had put himself under my protection charles
and myself were at work in the fields within sight the
lake their appearance first caught the attention charles
as they approached the shore and he enquired me respecting
the habit the foreigner which was different from
any he had been accustomed to see while we were yet
speaking i observed in them an intention to land within
sight my cottage this was an uncommon circumstance
our privacy was rarely invaded and we lived almost as
much out the world as we should have done in the remotest
island the atlantic ocean i reasoned in my own
mind upon their appearance they had little resemblance to
a party pleasure the habit the officers justice i
was perfectly acquainted with and the suspicion the real
nature their errand immediately darted on my thoughts
without saying a word to charles on the subject i hastened
with all the speed i could exert to the apartment the
stranger and acquainted him with what i had seen he
concurred with me in the ideas i had formed and appeared
much shocked at the intelligence there was however
no time to be lost and after having for a moment given
vent to an anguish which was too powerful to be suppressed
he withdrew as hastily as he could from the summerhouse
and betook himself to the woods he recommended to me
to leave him telling me that he could conceal himself most
effectually alone and observing that it would be necessary
for me to meet the officers and endeavour as much as possible
to remove their suspicions
accordingly as soon as he was gone i threw open the
windows the summerhouse removed the shutters and
took from it as effectually as i could all appearance 
having served as a place concealment this was a precaution
which the stranger had on a former occasion recommended
to me it fortunately happened that julia and
the little marguerite were gone out together in the fields on
the eastern side my cottage otherwise infallibly the child
foy her innocent prattle and perhaps julia by the apprehensive
sensibility her temper would have betrayed our
secret or at least have suggested to the officers a feeling as
if by a longer stay and a more diligent search they might
l
 travels st leon
possibly succeed in the object their expedition as it
was i received them at the door and learned from their
own mouths the nature their errand charles whom
they had crossed in the fields they had simply asked whether
they were right as to the name the person who was proprietor
 the cottage before them they described to me
with great accuracy the appearance the stranger and insisted
that he had been an inhabitant my cottage they
told me they were well informed that the summerhouse
in my garden had carefully been shut up for more than a
month past and that some person had been concealed there
i was interested in the distress the stranger i was impressed
with the dignity his character i implicitly confided
in his assertions innocence and the unjust persecution
that he suffered i was not insensible to the proposed
reward the realising which probably depended on his
safety but most all i considered my honour as pledged
for the protection the man who had thus cast himself
upon my fidelity and believed that i should be everlastingly
disgraced if he suffered any evil through treachery or neglect
on my part i therefore answered confidently to
the officers that they were misinformed and offered to conduct
them over every part my house and demesnes that
they might satisfy themselves by inspection that there was
no person concealed any where within my possessions i
should have been better pleased openly to have defied their
interrogatories and to have asked them whether allowing
their suspicions to be just they were entitled to believe that
i was such a villain as to betray a man who had thrown
himself upon my generosity but though this conduct
would have had a greater appearance gallantry i believed
it would have less the reality as it would have strengthened
their idea my participation and increased the danger
 the person i was bound to protect
they accepted my offer submitting to their search
and made a strict examination every place about my habitation
in which the stranger could be concealed disappointed
here they endeavoured by threats to discover
whether i was able to give them any information to these
i calmly answered that they had mistaken my character 
travels st leon 
that though i was a poor man i had not forgotten that i
was noble that they were already in possession my spontaneous
answer to their enquiries and that in no case and
upon no supposition should tyranny and ill treatment extort
from me what i was not in the first instance disposed
to give my wife was present during this conversation and
i could perceive felt an alarm for my danger that she would
have been incapable feeling for a danger to herself
though i was extremely anxious that these men should
be disappointed in the object their expedition yet i did
not neglect this opportunity endeavouring to obtain satisfaction
for my own curiosity i remarked at first that the
neapolitan was an inquisitor and this circumstance had
given additional poignancy to the uneasiness marguerite
but the accusations which the inquisition at this time
took cognisance were so numerous the ecclesiastical power
continually usurping upon the civil that i was little assisted
in the judgment i was desirous to frame by any inference to
be deduced from this circumstance i questioned directly
with an air as if it were merely in the way conversation
what was the crime the man whom they were in pursuit
and what was the cause forcible enough to induce a
neapolitan inquisitor to follow so decrepit and forlorn an
individual as he described beyond the alps and almost to
the banks the danube to this he answered roughly
that though he was not able to discover the object his
search he was by no means convinced that i was not his
abettor and accomplice and that as to his crime that was
not to be named the welfare christendom demanding
that the criminal and the memory his offences should
be buried together at the same time he warned me to
consider well what i did before i exposed myself to fce
overwhelmed by the vengeance the court which he
was a member to this i answered haughtily that i had
already condescended to repel his suspicion and that no
other man than an inquisitor would have had the stupidity
or the audaciousness to question my veracity i added
that i was perfectly acquainted with the nature his court
which was an object abhorrence to the whole christian
world but that he was mistaken if he supposed that the
l 
 travels st leon
detestable nature its proceedings would enable him to
practise every sort outrage with impunity the officers
withdrew into the little inclosure in front my cottage
and i overheard them consulting whether having failed in
their principal object they should carry me a prisoner
along with them the firmness my manner however
had awed them and the fearlessness i expressed seemed to
them to arise from a consciousness innocence they at
length departed as they came
i watched them from my cottage as they descended to
the shore and it was with no little pleasure that i perceived
them reembark and stand off for the opposite side the
lake this spectacle for a time entirely engaged me and
when i turned from the door i observed that my beloved
marguerite had been in tears she endeavoured to hide
this circumstance from my sight i took her affectionately
by the hand and pressing her to my bosom entreated her
not to make herself uneasy
ah reginald said she how can i avoid being uneasy
when i see you exposed to this imminent danger i
thought that in forfeiting our fortune and our rank and
retiring to this obscure and sequestered situation we might
at least promise ourselves the blessing the poor oblivion
and security and that should have consoled me for all i
have lost who is this man that is thus mysteriously hidden
among us what is the guilt from the punishment 
which he thus anxiously withdraws himself what can
be the nature your connection with such a man and
what will be the issue so perilous an adventure 
i hesitated i knew not what to answer to so earnest
an anxiety i was melted at the distress and the affection
 marguerite she saw my embarrassment and proceeded

mistake me not my beloved said she i have no
desire to pry into what you are willing to conceal forgive
the perturbation which has poured itself out in these involuntary
questions i repose an entire confidence in you
i would sooner die than interfere with any object you have
at heart go on according to the dictates your own
judgment undisturbed by me i will not doubt that you
travels op st leon 
have sufficient reasons for what you communicate and what
you suppress i am grieved indeed at the interruption 
our obscure and unambitious tranquillity but i had resolved
not to trouble you with my uneasiness and apprehensions
the incident this morning has extorted them from me 
but i will behave better in future
this scene was extremely distressing to me my wife
was oppressed with fears and i had nothing to answer her
the consolations that rose up in my own mind i was prevented
from communicating the more generously she
confided in me the more i felt the ungracious and disagreeable
nature the concealment i practised i endeavoured
however to encourage myself with the idea that the labour
would not be long and the harvest would prove abundant
i said in my own mind the worst is now over the business
has been commenced the shock to my own family
has actually occurred i must go on resolutely and shut
my eyes to the temporarily displeasing circumstances that
may be connected with the completing my object
chapter xiii
another source uneasiness was added to the distraction
my mind already endured the stranger did not appear
it was in the morning that the officers justice arrived
they departed about noon and in two hours afterwards i
entered the wood in search my guest the wood was
 some leagues in extent it was intersected by paths in
various directions it was interspersed with caverns j its
growth was all kinds in some places lofty trees that
seemed to form a support for the clouds in others an underwood
impenetrable alike to the feet and to the eye as
i entered the wood i however conceived that the discovery
 the stranger to me who was acquainted with its lurkingplaces
would be an affair little toil his feebleness and
decrepitude would not suffer him to proceed to any great
distance in this i was mistaken i looked carefully on
i 
 travels st leon
all sides i examined every recess and corner with which
i was acquainted but i found no trace the stranger
the scene was so complicated and involved that even this
was a labour considerable duration at length i became
satisfied that he was not in the nearer division the
wood
i paused i felt at once that it was little less than a
herculean task to hunt through the whole its dimensions
it would probably be little use to call and endeavour
by that means to discover his retreat i knew 
no name by which he was to be recognised and if my own
voice was but a slight resource to penetrate this immense
labyrinth foliage the voice the stranger weakened by
age and now probably still more enfeebled by hunger and
fatigue could not be expected to make itself heard beside
which as i knew not what the source information had
been to the officers who had just left me i was unwilling
to expose my guest to the danger that might arise from this
mode seeking him i could not even be sure though i
had seen their boat stand off from the shore that they might
not afterwards land one or more their party and be at
this very moment within earshot me i therefore proceeded
in anxiety and silence
my search was no more successful in the part the
wood with which i was little acquainted than in the part
with which i was most familiar i had already been engaged
four hours in the task and night began to come on
it shut in with heavy clouds that on all sides appeared
deeply loaded with rain i now began to consider my own
situation and by comparing circumstances found that i
was at a great distance from my own habitation there
was no direct path by which for me to return i had proceeded
to the right and the left backward and forward
sometimes by more open paths and sometimes forcing my
way through briars and brushwood as caprice or the hope
 effecting the object my search happened to guide me
it was therefore no easy matter to guess how i was to
return or even now that the lowering clouds had covered
the horizon with one uniform tint in which direction lay
the cottage or the lake while i stood contemplating what
travels st leon 
was to be done i heard the howling the wolves at a distance
 and their howl had that particular melancholy and
discomfiting sound which is well known to precede a coming
storm there was no time to be lost and accordingly
i set out i was less anxious to be at home on my own
account than for the sake quieting the alarms my
family to whom i had already occasioned too great a portion
 uneasiness
i had not proceeded far before the rain descended in
torrents intermingled with peals thunder and sheets 
lightning the thunder interrupted as it were from time
to time with the noise the wild beasts that inhabited the
wood deafened me while the excessive and instantaneous
brilliancy the lightning occasioned me an intolerable
aching in the organ sight it rained incessantly for two
hours and i found myself drenched and fatigued with the
wet during this time my progress was small and i was
ever and anon intercepted by the underwood and could not
without repeated experiments discover the means proceeding
at length the rain subsided and seemed to give
place to a gloomy and motionless calm soon after i discovered
a light at a distance and advanced towards it as
i approached i perceived that it proceeded from a set 
banditti to the amount fourteen or fifteen persons sitting
round a fire in the mouth a cavern i was glad to turn
my steps another way and was for some time afraid that
the noise i made in occasionally forcing my way through
the bushes would alarm them and cost me my life i
however fortunately escaped their notice this was in a
part the wood remote from the path i ought to have
taken and near the road to linda
the day began to dawn before i reached my own habitation
the conjecture i had made when i was unawares
upon the point falling into the hands the banditti
that the road linda was on the other side their retreat
was some service to me as an indication where to
find the cottage and the lake this road skirted the wood
on the side nearly opposite to that by which i entered it
the difficulties however i had to encounter were inconceivably
great in endeavouring to preserve my line direction
l 
 travels op st leon
after having been compelled four or five times to deviate
from the line it is seldom that a traveller will find himself
right in his conjecture as to the direction he is pursuing
unless he has some sensible object as a sort polestar by
which to govern his route it happened in this instance
that i was more fortunate than i was entitled to expect i
laboured indeed till daybreak without getting out the
labyrinth that inclosed me but the sun no sooner began
to lend an imperfect light than i recognised certain objects
which upon some former occasions i had observed and
perceived that my journey was nearly at an i entered
my cottage and found marguerite alone awake and expecting
me
she had been somewhat uneasy on account my absence
both from the extreme tempestuousness the night
and in consequence the painful sensations the events 
the preceding morning had introducedevents with which
it was almost unavoidable for her to imagine that my absence
was in some way connected the period my insanity
in switzerland might indeed have accustomed her
to the irregularity my motions but a term more than
six years which had intervened had produced in her expectations
and habits a different sort i related to this
admirable woman the adventures the night and the fruitlessness
 the search in which i had been engaged and
this openness communication resembling the nature
 the intercourse which had lately existed between us relieved
in some degree my burthened heart and cheered the
drooping spirits marguerite she dropped some consolatory
and sadly pleasing tears and her manner seemed to
say though she would not suffer her tongue to give the idea
words how sweet are cordiality and confidence oh do
not let our situation which has deprived us many other
comforts ever again be robbed this comfort which is
alone worth all the rest though she necessarily felt the
presence the stranger as an evil the bane our domestic
peace yet it was impossible for her not to compassionate
his fate and suffer some distress from his strange and
abrupt disappearance
after the conversation which had so eminently served as
travels st leon 
a relief to our minds marguerite left me to repose myself
from the extraordinary fatigue i had undergone but my
ttind was too much disturbed to suffer me to sink into the
arms forgetfulness i felt something tragical in the sad
destiny my unfortunate guest it was but too probable
that in his peculiarly weak state body and with his declining
health the being thus exposed for a day and a night
to the effects hunger the inclemency the air and
the tempestuousness the elements would put a close to
his existence i was determined soon to recommence my
search but how could i be sure that i should be more
fortunate today than the day before if i found him it
was most likely i should find him either dead or dying
the degree intercourse that had taken place between us
had made him occupy a considerable space in my thoughts
the prospects he had opened to me the conduct he had
induced me to adopt the painful effects and dissatisfaction
 mind which had been produced by that conduct as it
respected my family all combined to give me an interest
in his fate i had seen his talents i had felt his ascendancy
 had experienced that sort conflict which appearances
 guilt on the one hand and asseverations 
innocence on the other are calculated to produce in the
thoughts and emotions a bystander he was no common
man the expectations and conjectures he excited were
 no ordinary sort and i felt that an army might be
destroyed and a spacious plain covered with the wounded
and the dying without producing greater commotion in my
soul
in the anxious and disturbed state mind in which i
was the thoughts flow with extraordinary rapidity it will
be found attended with a strange and previously to the
experiment incredible mixture reasoning and passion 
philosophising and fury i was accordingly conscious at
this moment the truth the stranger's assertion that in
me he had a protector not a friend friendship is an object
 a peculiar sort the smallest reserve is deadly to it
i may indeed feel the emotions a friend towards a man
who in part conceals from me the thoughts his heart 
but then i must be unconscious this concealment the
 travels st leon
instant i perceive this limitation confidence he drops
into the class ordinary men a divorce is effected between
us our hearts which grew together suffer amputation
 the arteries are closed the blood is no longer
mutually transfused and confounded i shall be conscious
 all his qualities for i stand in the place an impartial
umpire i consider him as a machine capable so much
utility to myself and so much utility to other men but
i do not regard him as the brother my soul i do not
feel that my life is bound up in his i do not feel as if
were he to die the whole world would be at an to me
and that my happiness would be buried with him for ever
in the darkness the grave i am not conscious those
emotions which are the most exquisite and indescribable
the human mind can experience and which being communicated
by a sort electrical stroke to him who is their
object constitute the solace all his cares the alleviator
 all his calamities the only nectar and truest balm 
human life for me he stands alone in the world having
companions and associates the connections as it were 
mercantile selfishness or casual jollity and good humour
but no friend it was thus that i thought the stranger
he obtained from me the compassion due to a human being
and the respect extorted by his qualities but nothing calculated
radically to disturb the equilibrium the mind i
looked forward to his death with unruffled thoughts and an
moistened eye there was one thing indeed that shook
me more deeply the thought losing the promised reward
and having exposed myself to the evil an unquiet and
dissatisfied mind in vain
i rested but a few hours before i set out again upon the
search to which the interposition the darkness the
preceding night had put an abrupt close i had the precaution
to take with me a slight provision food and cordials
believing that if i found the stranger he would at
least be in the greatest need something reviving and restorative
charles earnestly intreated to assist me in the
search but upon this i put a peremptory prohibition it
would have been in direct contradiction to what the stranger
had most solemnly required me
travels st leon 
i had already spent several hours in anxiously tracing
the wood in every direction and the period noon was
past when approaching an obscure and almost impenetrable
thicket my ear was caught by a low and melancholy sound
which at first i knew not to what i was to ascribe it
however arrested my attention and caused me to assume
an attitude listening after the lapse little more thana
minute the same sound was repeated i now distinctly
perceived that it was the groan some creature in a very
feeble and exhausted state and immediately suspected that
it was the stranger i went almost round the thicket before
i could discern an entrance and though i looked with the
utmost care could perceive nothing that the thicket inclosed
the groan was repeated a third time the long intervals
between the groans gave a peculiar melancholy to the effect
and each seemed so much lower than the groan before that
nothing but the ear anxious attention would have caught
it at the same time that the tone conveyed an idea stupefied
yet vital anguish at length i perceived the legs
and something the garb a man it was the stranger 
he appeared to have crept into the thicket upon his hands
and knees when i forced my way to him he seemed in
the very act expiring he was lying on his face and i
raised him a little his eyes were fixed his mouth was
open his lips and tongue were parched and dry i infused
a few drops a cordial into his mouth for a moment
it appeared to produce no sensation but presently my
patient uttered a deep and longdrawn sigh i repeated my
application as a principal cause the condition in which
i found him was inanition the stimulant i administered
produced a powerful effect he moved his hands shuddered
turned his eyes languidly upon me and having appeared
to recognise me shut them hastily again i moved
him slowly and softly into a freer air and bathed his temples
with one the liquids i had about me by this time he
looked up and then suddenly round him with a wild and
hurried air he spoke not however he was speechless
in about a quarter an hour he relapsed into convulsions
in which it seemed probable he would expire they lasted
a considerable time and he then sunk into a state ingens
travels st leon
nobility i thought he was dead thus circumstanced it
was some relief to my humanity to have found him yet
alive and to have received his parting breath but in a
moment his secret and his promises recurred to me with
inexpressible anguish and i inwardly reproached him for
having deferred his communication so long as now to preclude
its ever being made i cannot describe the keenness
the burning and intolerable bitterness my sensation
keen it may well be supposed to have been from its having
so instantaneously and forcibly recurred at a time when
other objects seemed to press upon my senses no one
who has not felt what it is to fall in a moment from hope
or as i should rather say from assured possession what
his soul most loved and desired into black and interminable
despair can imagine what was then the state my mind
the body my patient sliced from my nerveless arms i
lifted up the eyes rage and phrensy as if to curse the author
 my being and then fell helpless and immoveable
by the side the stranger
i felt him move i heard him sigh i lifted up my
head and perceived stronger marks life and sense about
him than had yet displayed themselves i threw my arms
about him i pressed him to my heart the emphatically
gesture i used seemed to have a sort magnetical force to
rouse his dying powers with a little assistance from me
he sat upright my assiduity produced wonders it fortunately
happened that this thicket was but a half a mile
from my habitation and indeed was one the spots
which i had searched without success the day before
about the hour sunset partly by leading and partly
by supporting him i restored my guest to his former apartment

he remained speechless or nearly so he vented his
sensations in sighs in inward and inarticulate sounds and
even when he arrived at the power making himself understood
by words it was only by monosyllables and half
sentences that he conveyed to me his meaning i now gave
up my time almost entirely to an assiduous attendance on
the stranger every day i expected to be his last everyday
was more or less interspersed with symptoms that
travels st leon 
seemed to menace his instant dissolution during all this
time i remained in the anxious suspense contending hope
and fear was it probable that he would ever recover
strength enough to confer on me the legacy he had announced
 the particulars his secret i knew not but
judging from what i had heard the pretences and pursuits
 alchemy it was natural to suppose that he had a
process to communicate which would require on his part
considerable accuracy recollection as well as the power
 delivering himself in a methodical and orderly discourse
i was fortunate enough however to perceive after a tormenting
and tedious crisis that he appeared to be in a progress
 convalescence and that his strength both body
and mind were recruited daily after the lapse a fortnight
from the adventure the wood he one evening
addressed me in the following manner 
st leon i have been to blame i have put you to a
sufficient trial i have received from you every assistance
and kindness that my situation demanded i have imposed
on you much trouble and anxiety i have excited your
expectations by announcing to you in part what it was in
my power to bestow and i have finally risked the defrauding
your hopes and your humanity their just reward
do me the justice however to remember that i had no
presentiment the event which has so inauspiciously come
between you and your hopes fool that i was i imagined
i had suffered enough and that as i had obtained a longer
respite from external persecution than i almost ever experienced
i should be permitted to spend the short remainder
 my days uninterrupted i now however look back upon
this last assault with complacency it has cut off something
from the last remnant a life to the close which
i look forward with inexpressible longing at the same
time that i am still in prospect obtaining the final wish
 my heart the stealing out the world unperceived and
thus in some measure eluding the last malice my enemies
after my death i have but one injunction to leave
with you the injunction hercules to philoctetes that
no inducement may move you to betray to mortal man the
place in which you shall have deposited my ashes bury
 travels op st leon
them in a spot which i will describe to you it is not far
and is only recommended to me by its almost inaccessible
situation and that once done speak me and if possible
think me no more never on any account mention me
or allude to me never describe me or relate the manner 
our meeting or the adventure which has at length brought
on the desired close my existence
believe me in the feeble and helpless condition in which
i have spent the last fortnight your wishes and expectations
have been uppermost in my mind and there is
nothing i have felt with so much compunction as the danger
 leaving them unsatisfied to you perhaps i at present
appear to be rapidly recovering i feel the dart 
death in my vitals i know i shall not live four days it
is necessary therefore that i should finish without delay all
that remains for me to finish i will devote this night to
the arranging my thoughts and putting in order what i have
to communicate that no mistake or omission may have part
in a transaction so important come to me tomorrow
morning i will be prepared for you
as soon as i heard this discourse and provided the stranger
with every thing he could want during the night i withdrew
my heart was big with expectation my thoughts
all night were wild and tumultuous when the hour 
assignation arrived i hastened along the garden to the
summerhouse conscious that upon that hour depended all
the colour my future life since the stranger had been
in his present dangerous condition the door was not bolted
it was only locked the key was in my possession and
remained night and day attached to my person i opened
the door i panted and was breathless
i immediately saw that the stranger had undergone some
great alteration for the worse he had suffered a sort 
paralytic affection he lifted up his face as i entered it
was paler than i had ever seen it he shook his head
mournfully and intimated by signs the disappointment
which this morning must witness he was speechless
te fate fate exclaimed i in an agony despair am i to
be for ever baffled is the prize so much longed for and so
ardently expected at last to escape me it is not to be
travels op st leon 
imagined how much these successive endless disappointments
increased my impatience and magnified in my eyes
the donation i sought
the whole this and the following day the stranger
remained speechless the third day in the morning he
murmured many sounds but in a manner so excessively
inarticulate that i was not able to understand one word in
six that he said i recollected his prediction that he should
die on the fourth day the fever my soul was at its
height mortal sinews and fibres could sustain no more
if the stranger had died thus it is most probable that i
should have thrown myself in anguish and rage upon his
corpse and have expired in the same hour
in the evening the third day i visited him again he
had thrown his robe around him and was sitting on the side
 his couch the evening sun shot his last beams over
the windowshutters there were about eight inches between
the shutter and the top the window and some
branches vines with their grapes already ripe broke the
uniformity the light the side the couch faced the
west and the beams played upon the old man's countenance
i had never seen it so serene the light already softened
by the decline day gave it a peculiar animation and a
smile that seemed to betoken renovation and the youth 
angels sat upon it he beckoned me to approach i
placed myself beside him on the couch he took my hand
in his and leaned his face towards me
i shall never witness the light the setting sun
again were the first words he uttered i immediately
perceived that he spoke more collectedly and with better
articulation than at any time since the paralytic stroke
still however it was no easy matter to develop his words
but i wound up every faculty my frame to catch them 
and assisted as i was by the habit listening to his
speech for many weeks which during the whole that
time had never been distinct i was successful enough to
make out his entire discourse
it continued though with various interruptions for more
than half an hour he explained with wonderful accuracy
the whole his secrets and the process with which they
 travels st leon
were connected my soul was roused to the utmost stretch
 attention and astonishment his secrets as i have
already announced in the commencement this history
consisted two principal particulars the art multiplying
gold and the power living for ever the detail these
secrets i omit into that i am forbidden to enter my
design in writing this narrative i have said is not to teach
the art which i am in possession but to describe the
adventures it produced to me
the more i listened the more my astonishment grew
i looked at the old man before me i observed the wretchedness
 his appearance the meanness his attire his
apparent old age his extreme feebleness the characters
 approaching death that were written on his countenance
after what i had just heard i surveyed these things with
a sensation novelty as if i had never remarked them in
him before i said to myself is this the man that possesses
mines wealth inexhaustible and the capacity living forever

observing that he had finished his discourse i addressed
to him these words by a sort uncontrollable impulse
and with all the vehemence unsated and insuppressible
curiosity
tell me i adjure you by the living god what use
have you made these extraordinary gifts and with what
events has that use been attended 
as i spoke thus the countenance the old man underwent
a surprising change its serenity vanished his
eyes rolled with an expression agony and he answered
me thus 
be silent st leon how often must i tell you that
no single incident my story shall ever be repeated have
i no claim upon your forbearance can you be barbarous
and inhuman enough to disturb my last scene with these
bitter recollections i was silent
this is all that is material that passed at our interview
the stranger died the next day and was buried according
to his instructions
travels op st leon ll
chapter xiv
from the moment my last interview with the stranger
i was another creature my thoughts incessantly rolled upon
his communications they filled me with astonishment and
joy almost to bursting i was unable to contain myself 
i was unable to remain in any posture or any place i
could scarcely command myself sufficiently to perform the
last duties to his body in the manner he had directed i
paced with eager step the sands the lake i climbed the
neighbouring hills and then descended with inconceivable
rapidity to the vales below i traced with fierce impatience
the endless mazes the wood in which i so hardly
recovered my bewildered guest the uninterruptedness
and celerity bodily motion seemed to communicate some
ease to my swelling heart
yet there was one thing i wanted i wanted some
friendly bosom into which to pour out my feelings and
thus by participation to render my transports balsamic and
tolerable but this was for ever denied me no human
ear must ever be astonished with the story my endowments
and my privileges i may whisper it to the woods
and the waters but not in the face man not only am
i bound to suppress the knowledge the important secret
i possess but even the feelings the ruminations the visions
that are for ever floating in my soul it is but a vain and
frivolous distinction upon which i act when i commit to
this paper my history and not the science which is its cornerstone
the reason why the science may not be divulged
is obvious exhaustless wealth if communicated to all
men would be but an exhaustless heap pebbles and dust
and nature will not admit her everlasting laws to be so
abrogated as they would be by rendering the whole race 
sublunary man immortal but i am bound as far as possible
not only to hide my secrets but to conceal that i have
any to hide senseless paper be thou at least my confidant
 to thee i may impart what my soul spurns the
task to suppress the human mind insatiably thirsts for a
 travels op st leon
confidant and a friend it is no matter that these p
shall never be surveyed by other eyes than mine they
afford at least the semblance communication and the unburdening
 the mind and i will press the illusion fondly
and for ever to my heart
to return to the explanation my feelings immediately
after receiving possession my grand acquisition for without
that explanation the spirit and meaning my subsequent
narrative will scarcely be sufficiently apprehended
happy happy happy man exclaimed i in the
midst my wanderings and reveries wealth thy power
is unbounded and inconceivable all men bow down to
thee the most stubborn will is by thee rendered pliant as
wax all obstacles are melted down and dissolved by the
ardour thy beams the man that possesses thee finds
every path level before him and every creature burning
to anticipate his wishes but if these are the advantages
that wealth imparts to such as possess only those scanty
portions which states and nations allow to the richest how
enviable must his condition be whose wealth is literally
exhaustless and infinite he possesses really the blessing
which priestcraft and superstition have lyingly pronounced
upon the charitable he may give away the revenues 
princes and not be the poorer he possesses the attribute
which we are accustomed to ascribe to the creator the
universe he may say to a man be rich and he is rich
he can bestow with equal facility the smallest gifts and the
greatest palaces as if they were the native exhalations 
the soil rise out the earth at his bidding he holds the
fate nations and the world in his hand he can remove
forests and level mountains drain marshes extend
canals turn the course rivers and shut up the sea with
doors he can assign to every individual in a nation the
task he pleases can improve agriculture and establish manufactures
can found schools and hospitals and infirmaries
and universities he can study the genius every man
and enable every man to pursue the bent his mind
poets and philosophers will be fostered the sublimest flights
 genius be produced and the most admirable discoveries
effected under his auspicious patronage the whole world
travels op st leon l
are his servants and he if his temper be noble and upright
will be the servant the whole world nay it cannot
happen otherwise he has as few temptations to obliquity
as omnipotence itself weakness and want are the parents
 vice but he possesses every thing he cannot better
his situation no man can come into rivalship or competition
with him i thank god i have known the extremes
 poverty and therefore am properly qualified to enjoy my
present happiness i have felt a reverse fortune driving
me in one instance to insanity in another instance threatening
to destroy me my wife and children together with
the plague hunger my heart has been racked with
neverdying remorse because by my guilt and folly my
children have been deprived the distinction and rank to
which they were born and plunged in remediless obscurity
heaven has seen my sufferings and at length has graciously
said it is enough because i have endured more than
man ever endured from the privation fortune god in his
justice has reserved for me this secret the transmutation
 metals i can never again fall into that wretchedness
by which my understanding was subverted and my heart
was broken
from this part the legacy the stranger my mind
reverted to the oth i surveyed my limbs all the joints
and articulations my frame with curiosity and astonishment
 what exclaimed i these limbs this complicated
but brittle frame shall last for ever no disease
shall attack it no pain shall seize it death shall withhold
from it for ever his abhorred grasp perpetual vigour
perpetual activity perpetual youth shall take up their abode
with me time shall generate in me no decay shall not
add a wrinkle to my brow or convert a hair my head to
grey this body was formed to die this edifice to crumble
into dust the principles corruption and mortality are
mixed up in every atom my frame but for me the
laws nature are suspended the eternal wheels the
universe roll backward i am destined to be triumphant
over fate and time 
months years cycles centuries to me all these are
but as indivisible moments i shall never become old j i
m 
 travels op st leon
shall always be as it were in the porch and infancy 
existence no lapse years shall subtract any thing from
my future duration i was born under louis the twelfth 
the life francis the first now threatens a speedy termination
 he will be gathered to his fathers and henry his
son will succeed him but what are princes and kings and
generations men to me i shall become familiar with
the rise and fall empires in a little while the very name
 france my country will perish from the face the
earth and men will dispute about the situation paris as
they dispute about the site ancient nineveh and babylon
and troy yet i shall still be young i shall take my most
distant posterity by the hand i shall accompany them in
their career and when they are worn out and exhausted
shall shut up the tomb over them and set forward
there was something however in this part my speculation
that did not entirely please me methought the
race mankind looked too insignificant in my eyes i
felt a degree uneasiness at the immeasurable distance
that was put between me and the rest my species i
found myself alone in the world must i for ever live
without a companion a friend any one with whom i can
associate upon equal terms with whom i can have a
community sensations and feelings and hopes and
desires and fears i experienced something less than a
wish yet a something very capable damping my joy
that i also were subject to mortality i could have been
well content to be partaker with a race immortals but i
was not satisfied to be single in this respect i was not
pleased to recollect how trivial would appear to me those
concerns a few years about which the passions men
are so eagerly occupied i did not like the deadness 
heart that seemed to threaten me i began to be afraid 
vacancy and torpor and that my life would become too uniformly
quiet nor did it sufficiently console me to recollect
that as one set friends died off the stage another
race would arise to be substituted in their stead i felt that
human affections and passions are not made this transferable
stuff and that we can love nothing truly unless we
devote ourselves to it heart and soul and our life is as it
were bound up in the object our attachment
travels op st leon 
it was worse when i recollected my wife and my children
when i considered for the first time that they were now ina
manner nothing to me i felt a sensation that might be
said to mount to anguish how can a man attach himself
to any thing when he comes to consider it as the mere
plaything and amusement the moment in this statement
however i am not accurate habit is more potent than any
theoretical speculation past times had attached me deeply
irrevocably to all the members my family but i felt
that i should survive them all they would die one by one
and leave me alone i should drop into their graves the
still renewing tear anguish in that tomb would my
heart be buried never never through the countless ages
 eternity should i form another attachment in the
happy age delusion happy and auspicious at least to the
cultivation the passions when i felt that i also was a
mortal i was capable a community sentiments and a
going forth the heart but how could i an immortal
hope ever hereafter to feel a serious an elevating and expansive
passion for the ephemeron an hour 
as the first tumult my thoughts subsided i began as
is usual with persons whose minds are turned loose in the
search visionary happiness to picture to myself more
steadily and with greater minuteness the objects i would
resolve early to accomplish i would in the first place
return to france my adored country the residence my
ancestors whose annals they had adorned whose plains had
witnessed their heroic feats and whose earth enclosed their
ashes to france i was endeared by every tie that binds
the human heart her language had been the prattle my
infancy her national manners and temper were twined
with the fibres my constitution and could not be rooted
out i felt that every frenchman that lived was my brother
banishment had only caused these prejudices to strike their
tendrils deeper in my heart i knew not that i should
finally limit my abode to france a man who like 
is without life may well consider himself
as being also like him without father without mother
and without descent but at all events i would first fix
my children who did not participate in my privileges in
m 
 travels op st leoif
their native soil i would reside there myself at least till
they were fully disposed and till the admirable partner 
the last seventeen years my life had resigned her breath i
would immediately repurchase the property my ancestors
which had been so distressfully resigned the exile should
return from his seven years banishment in triumph and
splendour i would return to the court my old patron
and friend the gallant francis and present to him my boy
the future representative my family now one year older
than i had been at the field the cloth gold though
an exile from my country i had not been an inattentive
witness her fortunes the year fifteen hundred and
fortyfour was a remarkable and interesting year in the
history france the endless animosities francis and
the emperor had broken out with new fury about two years
before in the spring the present year the count d'an
guien had won a battle in piedmont in which ten thousand
imperialists were left dead upon the field and which
might be considered as having at length effaced the defeat
 pavia in the same part the world nineteen years before
the moment it had been announced that a battle was resolved
on the young nobility france with their characteristic
ardour had hurried to the scene and the court 
paris was in an instant as it were turned into a desert
on the other hand the emperor and the king england
had concerted for the same season a formidable plan 
attack against our northern frontier with an army 
twentyfive thousand men respectively the one on the side
 champagne and the other picardy they agreed to
advance directly into the heart the kingdom and to unite
their forces in the neighbourhood paris the last intelligence
that iad leached me was that chateau theory
about twenty leagues from the metropolis was in the hands
 the emperor and that the inhabitants the capital
filled with consternation were seeking their safety by flight
in every direction these circumstances had passed idly
by me and left little impression so long as i considered
myself as an obscure peasant cut off for ever from the bosom
 my country but vested with the extraordinary powers
the battle cerisoltes
travels st leon l
now intrusted to me the case was altered i felt even a
greater interest in my sovereign now pressed down with
disease and calamity yet retaining the original alacrity and
confidence his soul than i had done when i saw him in
all the pride youth and all the splendour prosperity
i was anxious that charles should now enter into his service
 and i determined once again to assume the cuirass
and the falchion that i might he the instructor his
youth and his pattern in feats war i resolved that my
shepherdboy bred in obscurity among woods and mountains
should burst with sudden splendour upon his countrymen
and prove in the field his noble blood and generous
strain i also proposed to myself both out sympathy
for my king and to give greater eclat to my son's entrance
into life to replenish with my treasures the empty coffers 
france and thus to furnish what at this period seemed to
be the main spring upon which the fortune war depended
with the advantages i could afford him the career 
charles could not fail to be rapid and illustrious and he
would undoubtedly obtain the staff constable france
the possessor which montmorency was now in disgrace
i would marry my daughters to such the young nobility
as i should find most distinguished in talents and spotless
in character when by the death her i most loved my
affections should be weaned from my country and the scenes
to which i had been accustomed were rendered painful and
distressing i would then set out upon my travels i would
travel with such splendour and profusion expense for
this though mortified in me by a reverse many years
duration continued to be the foible my heart as should
supersede the necessity letters recommendation and
secure me a favourable reception wherever i appeared i
might spend a life in a manner in every country that was
fortunate enough to allure my stay spreading improvements
dispensing blessings and causing all distress and calamity
to vanish from before me

chapter xv
my mind was occupied in these and similar reveries for
several weeks after the death the stranger my wife and
children had hoped after that event that i should have
returned to the habits which had pervaded the last six years
 my existence and which they had felt so eminently productive
 gratification and delight in this hope they
found themselves deceived my domestic character was
for the present at least wholly destroyed i had a subject
 contemplation that did not admit a partaker and from
this subject i could not withdraw my thoughts so much as
for an instant i had no pleasure but in that retirement
where i could be unseen and unheard by any human eye or
ear if at any time i was compelled to join the domestic
circle i despatched the occasion that brought me there as
speedily as possible and even while i remained in it was
silent and absent engrossed with my own contemplations
and heedless and unobservant every thing around me
my abstraction was not however so entire as to prevent
me from sometimes stealing in a sort momentary interregnum
 thought in that pause where the mind rests
upon the chain already passed over and seems passively to
wait for the sequel a glance at my family i looked at
them without knowing what it was that i did and without
the intention to notice what i saw yet even in this state
 mental abstraction visible objects will sometimes succeed
in making their impression i perceived that my wife
and children suffered from my behaviour i remarked a
general air disconsolateness and a mild expostulating
submission to what nevertheless the heart deeply deplored
they did not presume to interrupt me they did not by
prying and inquisitive speeches attempt to extort from me
the secret the alteration they saw but it was manifest
they conceived some great and radical calamity had poisoned
the heart our domestic joy
it was these symptoms thus remarked by me that first
roused me from the inebriation my new condition i
travels op st leon 
was compelled to suspect that while i revelled in visions 
future enjoyment i was inflicting severe and unmerited
pains on those i loved it was necessary if i valued their
happiness that i should descend from the clouds speculation
and fancy and enter upon the world realities
but here i first found a difficulty to which during the
reign my intoxication i had been utterly insensible i
was rich i could raise my family as far as the power 
money extended money which may in some sense be sty led
the empress the world to what heights i pleased i
had hitherto committed the fault so common to projectors
 looking only to ultimate objects and great resting places
and neglecting to consider the steps between this was an
omission high importance every thing in the world
is conducted by gradual process this seems to be the
great principle harmony in the universe nothing is
abrupt one thing is so blended and softened into another
that it is impossible to say where the former ends and the
latter begins
this remark is fully applicable to the situation which was
now before me yesterday i was poor today i was possessor
 treasures inexhaustible how was this alteration
to be announced to dissipate the revenues princes
to purchase immense estates to launch into costly establishments
are tasks to which the most vulgar mind is equal
but no man stands alone in the world without all trace 
what he has been and with no one near that thinks himself
entitled to scrutinise his proceedings and his condition
least all was this my case i was bound to certain
other persons by the most sacred obligations i could not
separate myself from them i could not render myself a
mere enigma in their eyes though in the language the
world the head my family they were my natural censors
and judges i was accountable to them for my conduct it
was my duty paramount to all other duties to stand as a
fair upright and honourable character in their estimation
if these remarks be true taken in a general view they
are much more so when applied to my particular case
there are men who live in the midst their families like
an eastern despot surrounded with his subjects they are
 travels op st leon
something too sacred to be approached their conduct is not
to be reasoned upon the amount their receipts and disbursements
is not to be inspected their resources are unknown
 no one must say to them what dost thou or
why hast thou thus conducted thyself even these persons
will not escape the tax to which all men are liable they
cannot kill the general spirit enquiry the mystery in
which they wrap themselves will often serve as an additional
stimulus they will finally encounter the judgment and
verdict all for myself i had lived in the midst my
family upon a system paternal and amicable commerce
i had suffered too deeply from a momentary season 
separation and mystery not to have been induced to renounce
it decisively and for ever
firm however as i had imagined my renunciation to
have been i was now thrown back upon what i had most
avoided i had a secret source advantage the effects 
which were to be participated by those i loved while the
spring was to remain for ever unknown what i most
sought upon this occasion was that my family should
share my good fortune and at the same time be prevented
from so much as suspecting that there was any thing mysterious
connected with it to effect this i presently conceived
that it would be necessary to sacrifice the sudden
and instantaneous prosperity i had proposed to myself and
introduce the reverse our condition by slow and as far
as possible insensible degrees
one thing on which i determined preparatory to the
other measures i had in view was to remove from my present
habitation and take up my residence for a time in the
city constance in the cottage the mountains it was
impossible o make any material alteration m my establishment
my property was the narrowest extent nor
would it be easily practicable in a country the inhabitants
 which were accustomed to a humble allotment considerably
to enlarge it my house was frugal if not mean 
and unless it were first pulled down and built over again
the idea introducing servants equipage or splendour into
it would be absurd my design was not to make a long
abode where i now was but as soon as my family should
travels op st leon 
be sufficiently prepared for the transition to return to my
native country i believed in the mean time that in the
capital the bishopric where my name was scarcely remembered
by a single individual i should be more at
liberty to proceed as circumstances suggested than in my
present rural situation where every neighbour regarded
himself as vested with a sort inquisitorial power over all
around him
to account for this measure to my family i felt it incumbent
on me to confess to them a certain pecuniary acquisition
the story that most readily suggested itself was
that the stranger having left behind him a certain sum
 which he made a donation to me this though in the
plain and direct sense the terms it were false yet in its
spirit bore a certain resemblance to the truth and with
that resemblance in spite the rigid adherence to veracity
that first ornament a gentleman that most essential prerequisite
to the regard arid affection others which i had
hitherto maintained i was induced to content myself
what could i do i was compelled to account for appearances
 i was forbidden by the most solemn injunctions to
unfold the truth i should indeed have felt little complacence
in the disclosure i should have been reluctant to
announce a circumstance which as i began to feel introduced
a permanent difference and separation between me
and my family
the sum at which i fixed the legacy the stranger was
three thousand crowns i was not inattentive to the future 
i should have been glad by my present account to have
furnished a more ample solution for circumstances which
might occur hereafter but some regard was due to probability
an unknown a solitary man broken with age
who arrived on foot and who declined all aid and attendance
must not be represented as possessing mines treasure

it was some time before i could prevail on myself to
break my story to the inhabitants my cottage as the
time approached when i was to bid an everlasting farewell
to rural obscurity and a humble station they seemed to
adorn themselves in new charms i was like the son a
 travels st leon
king who had hitherto been told by his attendants that
was a mere villager and who while his youthful imagination
is dazzled by the splendour that awaits him yet looks
back with a wistful eye upon his mirthful sports his former
companions and the simple charms her who first
obtained his guileless love i announced my acquisition
and my purpose with a faltering tongue and a beating
heart
i could perceive that my tale produced few emotions 
pleasure in those who heard it julia and her mother
especially were warmly attached to their retirement and
the scenes which had witnessed so many pleasurable incidents
and emotions chagrin in spite themselves made
a transient abode upon their countenances but the unresisting
mildness the one and the considerate attachment
 the other prevented for the present their sensations
from breaking out into words the feelings however
that they consigned to silence did not entirely escape the
notice the lively little marguerite she sympathised
with them probably without being aware that they were
sad she came towards me and with much anxiety in
her enquiring face asked why we must go away from the
cottage if i had got some money i might go to the
town and buy sweetmeats and ribands and new clothes
and a hundred more pretty things and bring them home
for her part she should be better pleased to put on her
finery and make her feast in the pretty old summerhouse
now she was again permitted to go and play in it than ina
palace all stuck over with emeralds and rubies her
mother wiped away a tear at the innocent speech her
darling kissed her and bid her go and feed the hen and
her chickens charles was the only one in whom i could
observe any pleasure at my intelligence he was not as
yet skilful enough to calculate the advantages that three
thousand crowns could purchase but i could see joy
sparkle in his eyes as i announced my intention bidding
adieu to retirement and taking up my rest in the capital 
the district his veins swelled with the blood his ancestors
 his mind was inured to the contemplation their
prowess already sixteen years age he hacusecretly
travels st leon 
burned to go forth into the world to behold the manners
 his species and to establish for himself a claim to some
rank in their estimation he had pined in thought at the
mediocrity our circumstances and the apparent impossibility
 emerging for he regarded the duty contributing
his labour to the subsistence the family as the first 
all obligations and the more the bent his spirit struggled
against it the more resolutely he set himself to comply
the rest the family were no sooner retired than marguerite
finding in what i had just announced to all an
occasion from the use which she could not excuse herself
took this opportunity unburthening the grief which
had long been accumulating in her mind
st leon said she listen kindly to what i am going
to say to you and assure yourself that i am actuated by
no spleen resentment or illhumour but by the truest
affection i perceive i have lost in your apprehension
the right advising you i am no longer the partner
 your counsels i am no longer the confident your
thoughts you communicate nothing but what you cannot
suppress and that you communicate to your whole
family assembled heaven knows how dear to me is every
individual that family but my love for them does not
hide from me what is due to myself i know that a husband
who felt as a husband ought and give me leave to
say as i have deserved you should feel towards me could
not act as you have acted tonight
you must excuse my reminding you some things
which you seem to have forgotten i would not mention
them if they had not been forgotten when they ought to
have been remembered i have lived seventeen years with
you my whole study had been your advantage and pleasure
have you any thing to reproach me with point
out to me if in any thing i could have added to your
pleasure and have neglected it what i have done has not
been the ceremonious discharge a duty it has been the
pure emanation an attachment that knew no bounds i
have passed with you through good fortune and ill fortune
when we were rich i entered with my whole heart into your
pleasures because they were yours when we were poor i
 travels op st leon
endured every hardship without a murmur i watched hy
you i consoled you i reconciled you to yourself i do
not mean to make a merit all this no reginald i
could not have acted otherwise if i would
t do me the justice to recollect that i have not been a
complaining or irritable companion in all our adversities
in the loss fortune and the bitter consequences that
loss i never uttered a reproachful word what poverty
sorrow hunger and famine never extorted from me you
have at length wrung from my bleeding heart st leon 
i have known your bosomthoughts in no former instance
has your affection or your confidence been alienated from
me and that consoled me for all the rest but now for
three months the case has been entirely altered you have
during all that time been busy pensive and agitated but
i have been as much a stranger to your meditations as if
i had never been accustomed to be their depository you
have not scrupled to inflict a wound upon me that no
subsequent change will ever be able to cicatrise nor indeed
do i see any likelihood a change you announce
our removal to constance what we are to do next with
what views or for what purpose i am ignorant
i have made my election my heart is formed for
affection and must always feel an uneasy void and desolation
without it if you had thus robbed me your
attachment in an early period our intercourse i know
not upon what extremity my disappointment and anguish
might have driven me they are harder to bear now
but i submit it is too late either for relief or remedy
what remains my powers and my strength i owe to my
children i will not seduce them from their father they
may be benefited by his purse or his understanding though
like me they should be deprived his affection you
may be their friend when i am no more i feel that this
will not last long i feel that the main link that bound
me to existence cannot be snapped and thus snapped by
unkindness worse than death without promising soon to
put a period to my miseries i shall be your victim in
death after having devoted my life to you in a way in
which few women were ever devoted to their husbands
travels op st leon 
but this is not what i purposed chiefly to say this is
what my situation and my feelings have unwillingly wrung
from me though you have injured me in the tenderest
point i still recollect what you were to me i still feel
deeply interested in your welfare and the fair fame you are
to transmit to your children i entreat you then to reflect
deeply before you proceed further you seem to me to
stand upon a precipice nor do the alteration that has taken
place in your manners and the revolution your heart
lead me to augur favourably the plans you have formed
what is this stranger whence came he why did he
hide himself and why was he pursued by the officers 
justice had he no relations was his bequest the
sum he had about him his own act and who is the witness
to its deliberateness or its freedom you must not think
that the world is inattentive to the actions men or their
circumstances if it were the fame we prize would be an
empty bauble no sir a fair fame can only be secured by
unequivocal proceedings what will what can be thought
 your giving shelter to an unknown a man accused 
crimes a man never beheld even by an individual your own
family and upon the strength whose alleged bequest
you are about to change the whole mode your life 
nor reginald must you think me credulous enough to
imagine that you have now disclosed the whole or the precise
truth three thousand crowns is not a sum sufficient
to account for what you propose for the long agitation 
your thoughts or for the change character you have sustained
you must either totally deprived rational
judgment or there must be something behind that you
have not communicated what do you purpose in going
to reside in the midst a city foreign to the manners 
a frenchman distracted with internal broils and embittered
to us by the recollection the extremities we personally
suffered in it is your ambition sunk so low that ifc
can be gratified by such a transition no you mean more
than you have announced you mean something you are
unwilling to declare consider that meaning well put
me out the question i am nothing and no longer desire
to be any thing but donot involve yourself in in
travels st leon
delvile disgrace or entail upon your memory the curses 
your children 
what a distress was mine who in return to so generous
and noble an expostulation could impart no confidence and
indulge no sincerity i felt a misery which till this
hour i had been unable to form a conception fool that
i was i had imagined that when endowed with the bequests
 the stranger no further evil could approach me 
i had in my visionary mood created castles and palaces
and expatiated in the most distant futurity and here i
was stopped and disappointed at the threshold in the very
first step my proceedings what i could however i
did i poured forth to marguerite not the secrets my
understanding but the overpowering emotions my soul
best most adorable women cried i how you
rend my heart with the nobleness your remonstrances i
never was man blessed with a partner so accomplished and
exemplary as i have been do you think your merits can
ever be obliterated from my memory do you think the
feelings gratitude and admiration can ever be weakened
in my bosom or that the strength and singleness my attachment
can suffer decay bear me witness heaven i
know no creature on the face the earth that can enter
into competition with you there is not the thing in nature
that i prize in comparison i love you a thousand times
better than myself and would die with joy to purchase
your ease and satisfaction i can never repay the benefits
you have conferred on me i can never rise to an equality
with you
what anguish then do you inflict upon me when you
talk becoming the victim my unkindness believe
you i can endure after having dissipated your patrimony
and drawn you with me into exile after having experienced
from you a tenderness such as man never in any other instance
obtained from woman to entertain the idea embittering
the remainder your life and shortening your
existence i should regard myself as the most execrable 
monsters i could not live under the recollection so
unheardof a guilt if you would not have me abhor myself
and curse existence live confide in me and be happy 
travels op st leon 
oh marguerite how wretched and pitiable is my
situation make some allowance for me i have a secret
that i would give worlds to utter but dare not do not
imagine that there is or can be any decay in my affection 
confide in me allow to necessity what never never
could be the result choice in all things else you shall
know my inmost heart as you possess the boundless and
unalterable affections my soul
marguerite was somewhat but not wholly soothed by
the earnestness my protestations she saw for the prescience
 the heart is never deceived that a blow was
given to the entireness our affection from which it would
never recover she felt for in truth and delicacy sentiment
she was much my superior that the reserve in which
i persisted and for which i deprecated excuse might be
sufficiently consistent with a vulgar attachment but would
totally change the nature ours she was aware that it
related to no ordinary point that it formed the polestar 
my conduct that it must present itself afresh from day today
and that in its operation it amounted to a divorce 
the heart she submitted however and endeavoured to
appear cheerful though she felt the worm sorrow
gnawing her vitals she was unwilling to occasion me an
uneasiness it was in her power to withhold she was struck
with the consistency and determination my resistance
and expostulated no more
we went to constance we bade adieu to the scene 
a six years happiness such as the earth has seldom witnessed
i alone had occasioned some imperfection in that
happiness there were times indeed when sitting in
affectionate communion with my wife and surrounded by
my children my sensations had been as delicious as the
state human existence ever had to boast i felt my
heart expand i was conscious to the unreserved union
that subsisted among us i felt myself identified with all
that i loved and all for whom my heart was anxious but
the curse entailed upon me from the earliest period to
which my memory can reach operated even in the cottage
 the lake i was not formed to enjoy a scene pastoral
simplicity ambition still haunted me an uneasiness
n
 travels st leon
scarcely defined in its object from time to time recurred to
my mind if i thought i wanted nothing for myself i
deemed a career honour due to my children again
when i regarded honour as an empty phantom and persuaded
myself that all conditions life were intrinsically
equal i recollected the fearful scene where hunger and destruction
had hung over us in constance and in imagination
often pictured to myself that scene as on the point 
being renewed the sword the demon famine seemed
to my disturbed apprehension to be suspended over us by a
hair such had been the draught bitterness that occasionally
detracted from this most enviable as in retrospect
i am willing to denominate it period my existence
we quitted our rural retreat and took up our abode ina
prosperous mercantile city i hired commodious apartments
in one the grand squares not far from the spot
where the fairs are usually held undoubtedly there was
nothing in this residence very congenial to the bent my
disposition or the projects that fermented in my mind i
had merely chosen it by way interval and to soften the
transition from what i had been to what i purposed to be
in the multitude irresolute thoughts with which i laboured
the small distance constance from the cottage 
the lake made me feel as if the removal thither was one 
the gentlest and most moderate measures to which i could
have recourse
i had never been less happy and at peace with myself than
i was now from general society and the ordinary intercourse
 acquaintance i had long been estranged and it
was in vain that i endeavoured to return to habits that
sort the society which the city constance afforded had
few charms for me it had no pretensions to the politeness
the elegance the learning or the genius an intercourse
with which had once been familiar to me it scarcely
contained within its walls any but such as were occupied in
merchandise or manufacture the attention its inhabitants
were divided between these objects and the encroachments
which were making upon the ancient religion by the
confession augsburg and the dogmas calvin the
majority the inhabitants were protestants and a few
travels op st leon 
years before they had expelled their bishop and the canons
 their cathedral having however miscarried in a religious
war into which they had entered these dignitaries
had been reinstalled in their functions and emoluments
the situation thus produced was an unnatural one and a
storm was evidently brewing more violent than any which
the city had yet sustained the gloomy temper and melancholy
austerity the reformers were as little congenial to
my temper as the sordid ignorance and selfishness the
trading spirit the community
i therefore lived in a state seclusion i endeavoured
to seek amusement in such novelties and occupations as
might present themselves to a person disengaged from the
general vortex but if the distinguished sphere in which
i had once moved disqualified me for taking an interest in
these puerilities the anticipations in which i indulged 
the future disqualified me still more my domestic scene
too no longer afforded me the consolation and relief i had
been accustomed to derive from it marguerite exerted
herself to appear cheerful and contented but it was an
exertion i began to fear that the arrow disappointment
had indeed struck her to the heart i was anxiously occupied
in considering what i was to do next i hoped that
our next step might operate to revive her gaiety and by
additional splendour amuse her solicitude i began to fear
that i had taken a wrong method and entered the career 
a better fortune with too much caution and timidity at
all events i felt that we no longer lived together as we had
done there was no more opening the heart between us
no more infantine guilelessness and sincerity no more 
that unapprehensive exposure every thought the soul
that adds the purest zest to the pleasures domestic life
we stood in awe each other each was to the other in
some degree an intrusive and unwelcome spy upon what
was secretly passing in the mind there may be persons
who regard this as an evil very capable being endured 
but they must be such as never knew the domestic joys i
once experienced the fall from one these conditions 
life to the other was too bitter

chapter xvi
anxious to divert my thoughts from what i hoped was only
a temporary evil i determined accompanied by charles to
make a tour some the cities germany dresden
was the capital to which i was most desirous conducting
him maurice duke saxony who held his court there
and who was now only twentythree years age was incomparably
the most accomplished prince the empire
desirous as i was that my only son should fill a distinguished
career i thought i could not better prepare him for the
theatre his native country than by thus initiating him
beforehand in scenes distinction and greatness
he was delighted with his tour we had not proceeded
many leagues from constance before indulging in the bent
 my mind i laid aside the humbleness our appearance
and the obscure style in which we travelled and having
procured a numerous cavalcade horses and servants i set
forward with considerable magnificence we passed through
munich ratisbon and prague at munich we found the
court the elector palatine the diet the empire was
sitting at ratisbon when we arrived at that city charles
had been almost entirely a stranger to every thing princely
and magnificent from the time he was nine years age 
and he was now exactly at that period human life when
external appearances are apt to make the strongest impression
to him every thing that occurred seemed like transportation
into a new world the figure we made procured us as
strangers unquestioned admission into every circle we
mixed with princes ourselves in garb and figure confounded
with those we saw i had lived too much and too
long in the most splendid society to find difficulty in resuming
the unembarrassed and courtly manners which i had
for years laid aside and charles might be said to see his
father in a new character novelty prompted his admiration
 he was intoxicated with wonder his disposition
travels op st leon 
had always led him to bold and adventurous conceptions 
nothing less than an imperious sense duty could have restrained
him from quitting our cottage and casting himself
upon the world in search honour and distinction his
generous heart had beat to burst away from the obscurity
 his station and it was with impatience and discontent
that he looked forward to the life a swain yet he knew
not how to break through the obstacles that confined him
it was therefore with transports pleasure that he saw
them vanishing as themselves and the career glory
opening as if by enchantment to his eager steps
the court dresden was infinitely more delightful to
him than the court munich or the imperial display at
ratisbon here charles saw a young prince in the flower
 his age whose talents and spirit rendered him the universal
object attention and adoration he remarked in
the fire his eyes the vivacity his gestures and the
grandeur his port something inexpressibly different from
those princes whom it is necessary that their rank should
be announced to you by some extrinsic circumstance that
you may not mistake them for a merchant's clerk or a city
magistrate the sentiment that he breathed as it were instinctively
as we returned from the first time our seeing
duke maurice was ef at twentythree years age may i
in appearance accomplishments and spirit resemble this
man 
here i was desirous making a longer stay than at the
cities through which we had previously passed and procuring
for my son some personal intercourse with this great
ornament the age i judged this to be the more easy
as in our first visit to the palace i had perceived some
french noblemen the protestant persuasion who had resorted
to the duke's court in search employment they
appeared not to know me but that was little to be wondered
at considering that i had been seven years absent from my
country and that the calamities by which i had been overtaken
more than once during that period might be supposed
to have produced a greater effect upon me than the
mere lapse years would have done among the rest i
remarked gaspar de coligny who was only twentyone
n 
 travels op st leon
years age at the time i quitted france and had then
been remarked as one the most promising young men his
country had to boast his stay here was expected to be
short his hopes in his own country from the greatness 
his connections were the highest class and he had only
come to dresden at the earnest invitation duke maurice
who entertained an ardent affection for him my heart led
me towards him policy concurred in dictating the application
as if i were fortunate enough to gain his favour my
son could not have a friend better qualified either to form
his character or forward his advancement
i wrote to coligny to announce my request to him and
in a few hours after the delivery my letter that young
nobleman came in person to wait on me he informed
me that he had done so because he had something delicacy
to mention which he did not choose to trust to the
intermission a third person and upon which as he
hoped i could remove his scruple he did not like even to
bestow the formality putting it on paper
i am a gentleman france said coligny you
will excuse my frankness i am a gentleman france 
you will not wonder at the niceness my honour mixing
in society i do not pretend minutely to investigate the
character every person with whom i converse but what
you ask me obliges me to consult my understanding and
enquire into facts i cannot consent to vouch for any
man's character to another till i have paid some attention
to the ground upon which that character rests
i remember the count de st leon with pleasure and
advantage at the court my own sovereign every one
admired his accomplishments his gallantry and his learning
every one spoke him with respect unfortunate
circumstances as we all understood deprived you your
patrimony that is nothing to me i respect a nobleman in
misfortune as much as when he is surrounded with wealth
and splendour you retired into voluntary exile i heard
with great grief some subsequent calamities that have
overtaken you but here in saxony i see you resuming
all your former splendour and coming forward with the
magnificence a prince other your countrymen have
travels st leon 
remarked it as well as myself and feel themselves at a loss
to account for what they see
e excuse me count by your application to me you
oblige me to speak freely i dare say you can clear up the
difficulty and account for this second revolution in your
fortune upon which i shall then be the first to congratulate
you i cannot suspect a man with your high descent
and the illustrious character you formerly maintained
 any thing dishonourable but you have not sufficiently
considered the account we all owe to one another
and the clearness proceeding we are obliged to maintain
not only to our own hearts but in the face the world
the present occasion is i trust fortunate for you and
when you have assisted me in complying with the rules by
which every honourable man governs himself i shall be
eager to publish your justification and render you all the
service in my power
i was ready to burst with astonishment and vexation
during this representation coligny i could feel my
colour change from pale to red and from red to pale i
could only answer with suffocation and inward rage that i
was much obliged to him i would consider what he said 
i would acquaint him with my justification and whenever
it was made he might be assured it should be an
ample one i was cautious as to what i uttered i could
not immediately foresee what it was eligible or what it was
possible to do and i was resolved that i would not by
an idle or hasty expression preclude myself in a matter 
so much moment from the benefits future deliberation
if what i had just heard had come from any other person
i should probably have despised it but i felt at once that
gaspar de coligny might be considered in a case this
sort as the representative all that was most honourable
and illustrious in my native country finding that i was
indisposed to any further communication on the subject he
took a polite leave and departed
i was no sooner alone than i felt myself overwhelmed
with mortification and shame i had rejoiced in the bequests

means restoring me to splendour and replacing my child

drew in the situation to which they were entitled by their
birth was that which i had regarded as the instrument
 their glory to become the medium their ignominy
and disgrace i had suffered all other misfortunes but
tie whisper dishonour had never been breathed against
me i was a son honour descended a race heroes
and cradled in the lap glory and fame when we
quitted paris in the year my incomparable wife had
set to sale our entire property resolved that though driven
into exile we would not leave it in the power the meanest
individual to controvert the sacred attention we yielded
to every just obligation since that time had declined
from the splendour rank to the humble situation a
rustic cultivating my little property with my own hands 
nay i had even for a short time hired myself as a labourer
in the garden the bishop constance but the same
disdain every thing disgraceful had followed me to my
cottage and my truckle bed which i had originally learned
in the halls chivalry and the castle my ancestors
accordingly i had uniformly retained the same honourable
character and spotless fame st leon the virtuous cottager
had in nothing blemished the name st leon surrounded
with glory in the siege pavia often and with
pride had i pointed out this circumstance to my son adding
wherever fortune calls you for whatever scenes you
may be reserved remember that your father was unfortunate
but that through life he never acted a deed nor conceived
a thought that should stain your manly cheeks with
the blush shame i stand before you a culprit as having
robbed you your patrimony but i have preserved
for you entire the inheritance our honour 
this had been the first lesson imprinted upon my infant
mind all other possessions i had ever held cheap and
worthless in comparison with that an illustrious name
my indignation at the attack it now sustained was boundless
the more i thought the more intolerable it appeared
i was impatient and furious like a lion struggling
in the toils i could with joy have trampled under my
feet whoever aspersed me i could have wantoned in blood
and defied my adversaries to mortal combat alas all my
travels st leon
fury was useless here it was no tale whispered in the
dark that i had to contend with it was the commentary
 the world upon incontestable facts though a hecatomb
 souls should be sacrificed at the shrine my blasted
name the facts would still remain the mystery still require
to be solved coligny the virtuous coligny had made no
observations on the circumstances he mentioned j he merely
proposed a difficulty and waited my answer
i was called upon to exercise the whole my deliberative
powers as to the reply which was to be returned or
the conduct to be held upon the question coligny
every thing i most valued was now at issue and a false
step taken under the present circumstances could never be
retrieved i had another sort party to deal with here
than when i had told marguerite the tale the stranger
and his legacy nothing would pass now but what bore
an open fair and unequivocal appearance i must vent
no assertion that could not bear to be sifted to the bottom
and that did not fully accord with all the vouchers with
which it could be collated i had written to marguerite
immediately after launching into the expense with which
our tour had been attended that i had received an unexpected
acquisition from the death a relation my
own family in france i knew that the story the three
thousand crowns would no longer account for the style in
which i was proceeding and this fabrication suggested
itself upon the spur the moment i hated to think 
the difficulties in the way explanation in which i was
involved i abhorred the system falsehood i was driven
to practise it did not occur to me at the time infatuated
as i was that i should have occasion to account for this
accession wealth to any one out my own family
marguerite i well knew had no correspondence in france
nor therefore any obvious means verifying or refuting
this second deception but such a story could not be told
to noblemen france without being instantly liable to be
compared with known facts and eventually investigated
upon the spot where the scene was laid marguerite herself
i well knew had listened with incredulity to the explanation
i had made and the alleged legacy the stranger 
 travels op st leon
what could i expect from indifferent hearers they might
not all possess her good sense and sagacity in judging but
they were destitute that personal kindness and partiality
which were calculated to induce her to credit whatever i
affirmed most men have a malignant pleasure in the detection
 specious pretences in humbling the importunate
superiority that obscures their claims and removing the
rival who might otherwise acquire the prize which they
are in pursuit
my mind was still torn and distracted with these contemplations
when in the afternoon the same day on
which i had received the visit coligny my attention
was suddenly roused by the abrupt entrance my son into
the chamber where i was sitting he opened the door
with a hurried action as he entered and having closed it
impetuously after him advanced directly towards me he
then stopped himself and turning from me i could perceive
a rush crimson in his face like that a man suffocated
a passion tears succeeded that shook his frame
and sufficiently proved that his feelings had sustained some
extraordinary shock my whole soul was alarmed at what
i saw and following him as he retired to the other side
 the room in the gentlest accents i endeavoured to soothe
him while i enquired with earnestness and trepidation into
the cause his grief
chapter xvii
he repelled me sit down sir sit down do not follow
me i beg you but sit down 
his manner was earnest and emphatically mechanically
and without knowing what i did i obeyed his direction
he came towards me
i have no time added he for qualifying and form
tell me am i the son a man honour or a villain 
he saw i was shocked at the unexpected rudeness 
his question
travels st leon 
forgive me my father i have always been affectionate
and dutiful i have ever looked up to you as my
model and my oracle but i have been insulted it never
was one your lessons to teach me to bear an insult 
is it replied i with the sternness that the character
 a father will seldom fail to inspire under such circumstances
 because you have been insulted that you think
yourself authorised to come home and insult him to whom
you owe nothing but respect and reverence 
stop sir before you claim my reverence you must
show your title to it and wipe off the aspersions under
which you at present labour
f insolent presumptuous boy know that i am not by
you to be instructed in my duty and will not answer so rude
a questioner the down as yet scarcely shades your schoolboy's
cheek and have you so forgotten the decencies 
life as to scoff your father his eye brightened as i
spoke
ei you are right sir it gives mepleasure to see your
blood rise in return to my passion your accent is the
accent innocence but indeed the more innocent and
noble you shall prove yourself the more readily will you
forgive my indignation
i cannot tell my temper does not fit me to bear the
rudeness a son nor do i think that such behaviour as
this can be any credit to you whatever may have been the
provocation tell me however what is the insult that has
thus deeply shaken you 
i went this afternoon to the tenniscourt near the river
and played several games with the young count luitmann
while we were playing came in the chevalier dupont my
countryman the insolence his nature is a subject 
general remark and he has though i know not for what
reason conceived a particular animosity to me a trifling
dispute arose between us we gradually warmed he
threatened to turn me out the court i resented the
insult and he passionately answered that the son an
adventurer and a sharper had no business there and he
would take care i should never be admitted again i attempted
to strike him but was prevented and presently
 travels op st leon
learned that the sudden and unexplained way in which we
have emerged from poverty was the ground his aspersion
as i gained time and reflected more distinctly upon
what was alleged i felt that personal violence could never
remove an accusation this sort i saw too though intoxicated
as i had idly been with the unwonted splendour
to which i was introduced i had not adverted to it at the
time that the case was a nature that required explanation
i had been accustomed to reverence and an implicit faith
in the wisdom and rectitude my parents and therefore
encountered in silent submission the revolution our fortune
but this neutrality will suffice no longer
to you sir i resort for explanation send me back
to the insolent youth and his companions with a plain and
unanswerable tale that may put to silence for ever these
brutal scoffs and reproaches let it be seen this night
which the two has most fully merited to be thrust out 
honourable society i trust i have not so demeaned myself
but that our mutual companions will join to compel
this unmannered boor to retract his aspersions
fc charles you are too warm and impetuous 
too warm sir when i hear my father loaded with
the foulest appellations 
you are young and ill qualified to terminate in the
proper way a business this serious aspect leave it to me 
 travels op st leon
from you and disown your name i shall be involved in the
same disgrace
saying thus he left me and in about half an hour returned
his return i had not foreseen i had made no use his
absence my mind was overcome my understanding was
stupefied by a situation and events i had so little expected
i had stood unmoved leaning against the wall from the
instant his departure i seemed rooted to the spot incapable
 calling up my fortitude or arranging my ideas
my eyes had rolled my brow was knit i had bit my lips
and my tongue with agony from time to time i had muttered
a few words my son my son wealth
wealth my wife my son but they were incoherent
and without meaning
charles reentered the apartment where the preceding
conversation had passed and the noise he made in entering
roused me he had his hat in his hand which he threw
from him and exclaimed with an accent dejection and
anguish my father farewell 
tf cruel cruel boy can you persist in your harsh and
calamitous resolution if you have no affection for me yet
think your mother and your sisters 
seek not sir to turn me from my purpose the struggle
against it in my own bosom has been sufficiently severe 
but it must be executed his voice as he spoke was inward
stifled and broken with the weight his feelings
then farewell i replied yet take with you
some provision for your long and perilous adventure name
the sum you will accept and whatever is its amount it
shall instantly be yours
i will have nothing it is this wealth with whose
splendour i was at first child enough to be dazzled that has
destroyed us my fingers shall not be contaminated with
an atom it what is to be my fate as yet i know not
but i am young and strong and enterprising and courageous
the lessons honour and nobility live in my
bosom though my instructor is lost his instructions shall
not be vain 
once more farewell from my heart i thank you for
your protestations innocence never will i part with
travels st leon 
this last consolation to believe them i have recollected
the manner in which they were uttered it was the manner
 truth if there be any evidence a contrary tendency
that i will forget though to the world i shall be
without father and without relatives i will still retain this
sacred consolation for my hours retirement and solitude
that my ancestors were honourable and my father in spite
 all presumptions to the contrary was innocent
how hard it is to quit for ever a family love and
affection as ours has been bear witness for me how
deeply i sympathised with you at paris in switzerland in
constance though now you dissolve the tie between us
yet till now never had a son greater reason for gratitude
to a father you and my mother have made me what i
am and that i may preserve what you have made me i
now cast myself upon an untried world the recollection
 what i found you in the past period my life shall befor
ever cherished in my memory 
i quit my mother and my sisters without leavetaking
or adieu it will be a fruitless and painful addition to
what each party must learn to bear dear excellent peerless
protector and companions my early years my
wishes are yours my prayers shall for ever be poured out
for you you sir who rob them a son and a brother
be careful to make up to them a loss which i doubt not
they will account grievous i can do nothing for them i can
throw myself into the arms poverty it is my duty
but in doing so i must separate myself from them assuredly
innocent and worthy more and greater benefits
than i could ever confer on them farewell 
saying this he threw himself into my arms and i felt
the agonies a parting embrace
chapter xviii
fob some time i could not believe him departed when i
retired to rest i felt the want charles to press my hand
and wish me refreshing slumbers and i passed on sad
and solitary to my chamber when i came next morn
o 
 travels st leon
ing into the breakfasting room charles was not there to
greet me with looks affection and duty and the gilding
and ornaments the apartment were to me no less disconsolate
than the damps and sootiness a dungeon
i hoped he would return i knew how tenderly he was
attached to his mother and his sisters i was fully convinced
that the affection for me which had been the perpetual
habit his mind could not be entirely eradicated
from his heart i mentioned him not in my letters to
constance the pen lingered my hand trembled when i
thought him i could neither pretend that he was with
me nor announce the catastrophe his absence but i
opened the letters marguerite with still increasing impatience
finding that he did not return to me i hoped
that some alteration the extraordinary resolution he had
formed would lead him to constance in vain i hoped 
there reached me by no conveyance from no quarter
tidings my son 
how surprising an event a youth not seventeen years
 age forming and executing in the same instant the purpose
 flying from his parents and his family deserting
all his hopes all his attachments all his fortune refusing
the smallest particle assistance or provision in his entrance
upon the wide scene the world oh charles exclaimed
i you are indeed an extraordinary and admirable youth 
but are you fortified against all the temptations the world
and all its hardships do your tender years qualify you to
struggle with its unkindness its indifference and its insults
in how few quarters is merit ever treated with the attention
and benevolence it deserves how often is it reduced to
tremble with indignation at the scoffs and brutality to which
it is exposed and at the sight folly and vice exalted in
its stead and appointed its despot and its master my son
my son what will be your fate is your unseasoned
frame reserved to perish by hunger in barren deserts and
beneath inclement skies will you not in some hour 
bitter disappointment and unpitied loneliness lay yourself
down in despair and die will you not be made the slave
 some capricious tyrant for bread generous as is your
nature will it be eternally proof against reiterated tempttravels
 st leon q
action upon what a world are you turned adrift a world
 which you know as little as the poor affrighted soul a
dying man knows when launching into the mysterious
impenetrable abyss eternity unnatural father to have
reduced my only son to this cruel alternative i should
with a less aching and agonising heart have accompanied
his senseless remains to the grave dreadful as that parting
is there at least the anxious mind the survivor has
rest there are no thoughts and devices in the silence 
the tomb there all our prospects and we are no
longer sensible to pain to persecution to insult and to
agony but charles thus departed wandering on the face
 the globe without protector adviser or resource no lapse
 years can put a close upon my anxiety for him if i
am in ease and prosperity i cannot relish them for my
exposed and living son may be at that moment in the depth
 misery if i am myself oppressed and suffering the
thought what may be his fate will form a dreadful addition
to all my other calamities what am i to say 
him upon my return to constance if he had died this
was a natural casualty and whatever grief it might occasion
time no doubt would mollify and abate it but what
account can now be rendered him to his disconsolate
mother and terrified sisters how can i lift up my head in
their presence or meet the glance their reproachful eyes 
the idea had occurred to me in the instant charles's
departure and immediately after his exit detaining or
bringing him back by force he was by his extreme youth
according to the maxims the world still in a state 
guardianship and unqualified to be the chooser his own
actions but to this mode proceeding however deeply
i felt the catastrophe which had taken place i could never
consent it was in utter hostility to the lessons chivalry
and honour with which i had been familiarised from my
earliest infancy there might be cases in which this restraint
laid by a father upon his child would be salutary
but the idea which had occasioned the secession charles
was decisive in this instance what right had i to chain
him to dishonour the whole bent his education had
been to impress him with the feelings by which he was
o 
 travels st leon
now actuated if i detained him for a short time was
there any vigilance on earth that could finally prevent him
from executing a purpose upon which his whole soul was
resolved or suppose there were must not the consequence
be to break his spirit to deprive him all manliness and
energy and to render him the mere drooping and soulless
shadow that conspicuous hero i had been anxious to
make him it might be said indeed that this was the determination
 a boy formed in an hour and that if i
detained him only long enough for deliberation and revisal
he would his own accord retract so desperate a project
but i felt that it was a resolution formed to endure and
was built upon principles that could not change so long as
an atom his mind remained no i was rather disposed
to say however grievous was the wound he inflicted on me
go my son act upon the dictates your choice as i
have acted on mine i admire your resolution though i
cannot imitate it your purpose is lofty and godlike and
he that harbours it was not born to be a slave be free 
and may every power propitious to generosity and virtue
smooth your path through life and smile upon your desires 
the anguish i felt for having lost my son and in this
painful and reproachful manner was not diminished to me
either by society or amusement i dared not go out my
house i saw no one but my own attendants i had not
the courage to meet the aspect a human creature i
knew not how far persons in dresden might have heard the
injurious reports which occasioned the flight my son or
even have been acquainted with the nature that flight
i had promised to see coligny again but alas the affair
which had at first led me to wish to see him was now at
an i had no heart to seek him nor indeed did i
know what story i was to tell him or how i was to remove
the suspicions he had urged against me the machine 
human life though constituted a thousand parts is in
all its parts regularly and systematically connected nor is
it easy to insert an additional member the spuriousness 
which an accurate observation will not readily detect how
was i to assign a source my wealth different from the
true which would not be liable to investigation and when
travels st leon 
investigated would not be seen to be counterfeit this
indeed is the prime source individual security in human
affairs that whatever any man does may be subjected to
examination and whatever does not admit being satisfactorily
accounted for exposes him whom it concerns to
the most injurious suspicions this law our nature so
salutary in its general operation was the first source all
my misfortunes
i began now seriously to consider what judgment i was
to pass upon the bequests the stranger were they to
be regarded as a benefit or a misfortune ought they to
be classed with the poisoned robe nessus which being
sent as a token affection was found in the experiment
to eat into the flesh and burn up the vitals him that
wore it should i from this instant reject their use and
returning to the modes life established among my fellowmen
content myself with the affection those with whom
i had intercourse though poverty and hardships mingled
with the balm 
the experiment i had made these extraordinary gifts
was a short one but how contrary were ah the results i had
arrived at from those i looked for when the stranger had
appeared six months before at the cottage the lake he
had found me a poor man indeed but rich in the confidence
and happy in the security and content every
member my family i lived in the bosom nature
surrounded with the luxuriance its gifts and the sublimity
 its features which the romantic elevation my
soul particularly fitted me to relish in my domestic scene
i beheld the golden age renewed the simplicity pastoral
life without its grossness a situation remote from cities and
courts from traffic and hypocrisy yet not unadorned with
taste imagination and knowledge never was a family
more united in sentiments and affection now all this
beauteous scene was defaced all was silence suspicion
and reserve the one party dared not be ingenuous and
the other felt that ah the paradise attachment was dwindled
to an empty name no questions were asked for no
honest answer was given or expected though corporeally
we might sit in the same apartment in mind a gulf wide
o 
 travels op st leon
impassable and tremendous gaped between us my wife
pined in speechless grief and it was to be feared had sustained
a mortal blow my son my only son a youth 
such promise that i would not have exchanged him for empires
had disappeared and as he had solemnly protested
for ever my heart was childless my bosom was bereaved
 its dearest hope it was for him principally that i had
accepted that i had rejoiced in the gifts the stranger
my darling vision was to see him clothed in the harness
surrounded with the insignia a hero there was nothing
i so earnestly desired as that his merits graced with the
favours fortune might cause him to stand confessed the
first subject france a situation more enviable than that
 its monarch since he who holds it is raised by deeds and
the other only by birth and if less respected by interested
courtiers is certain to be more honoured by the impartial
voice history but if i felt thus desolate and heartbroken
for the loss my son what would be the sentiments
 his mother more susceptible to feel and in her present
weakness spirits less vigorous to bear than myself when
the dreadful tidings should be communicated to her 
yet i could not resolve to renounce donations which i
had so dearly appropriated i held it to be abase and cowardly
to surrender gifts so invaluable upon so insufficient
an experiment he i thought must be a man ignoble
and grovelling spirit who could easily be prevailed on to part
with unbounded wealth and immortal life i had but just
entered the vast field that was opened to me it was the
nature all great undertakings to be attended with difficulties
and obstacles in the commencement to present a
face calculated to discourage the man that is infirm purpose
but it became my descent my character and pretensions
to show myself serene in the midst storms
perseverance and constancy are the virtues a man
affairs this extensive compass often prove in the issue
the reverse what they seemed in the outset the tempest
might be expected to disperse difficulties to unravel
themselves and unlookedfor concurrences to arise all
opposition and hostile appearance give way before him who
goes calmly onward and scorns to be dismayed
travels st leon 
chapter xix
it was thus that i spurred myself to persist in the path
upon which i had entered having remained some time
at dresden flattering myself with the hope that charles
might yet join me before i quitted that city i began to
think once more turning my steps towards the residence
 my family this was no cheerful thought but upon
what was i to determine i had a wife whom i ardently
loved and three daughters the darlings my heart because
i had lost a beloved son was i to estrange myself
from these i already felt most painfully the detachment
and widowhood to which i was reduced and i clung with
imperious affection to what remained my race the
meeting i purposed must be a melancholy one but in the
sorrows the heart there is a purer and nobler gratification
than in the most tumultuous pleasures where affectionis
silent i looked forward indeed to scenes endless
variety and attraction but in the mean time what seemed
first to demand my attention was the beloved circle i had
left behind in the city constance
i retraced upon the present occasion the route i had
lately pursued with my son how different were now my
sensations my heart was then indeed painfully impressed
with the variance and dissolution confidence that had
arisen between me and his mother it was perhaps principally
for the sake banishing this impression that i had
had recourse to the splendour equipage and attendance
which was first assumed upon the journey from constance
to dresden nor frivolous as this expedient may appear
in the unattractive dispassionateness narrative had it
been by any means weak effect at the time it was employed
when charles was once mounted on his proud
and impatient steed and decorated in rich and costly attire
i felt as it were the sluggishness my imagination roused
i surveyed his shape and his countenance with inexpressible
complacence and already anticipated the period when he
was to become the favourite his sovereign and his count
 st leon
try's pride now i returned with the same retinue but
the place that had been occupied by my son was empty i
sought him with frantic and restless gaze i figured him
to my disturbed and furious imagination till the sensations
and phantoms my brain became intolerable i raved
and imprecated curses on myself i endeavoured to divert
my thoughts by observing the scenes that passed before me
they talked to me charles they had been pointed outby
each to each and had been the subject our mutual
comment though charles was endowed with a high relish
for the beauties nature and in our little retreat on the
borders the lake had lived in the midst them he had
seen little the variety her features and the journey
we made through the heart germany had furnished him
with continual food for admiration and delight nor did
the scenes i beheld merely remind me the sensations
they produced in charles they led me through a wider
field i recollected long conversations and digressive excursions
which had been started by the impression they
made i recollected many passages and occurrences to
which they had not the slightest reference but which
having arisen while they constituted the visible scene were
forcibly revived by its reappearance thus from various
causes my lost and lamented son was not a moment out 
my thoughts during the journey while i continued at
dresden i seemed daily to expect his return but no
sooner did i quit that city than despair took possession 
my heart
thus anxious and distressed i arrived at prague and
soon after at ratisbon i travelled slowly because though
i was desirous returning to constance i anticipated my
arrival there with little complacence as i drew nearer to
my family i felt more distinctly the impossibility presenting
myself before them without first endeavouring to
take off the shock they would sustain at seeing me return
without my son i therefore resolved to send forward a
servant from ratisbon whom i directed to make all practicable
speed as i designed to wait for an answer he should
bring me at the city munich to attempt to write to
marguerite on this subject was a severe trial to me the
travels st leoiv 
whole however that i proposed to myself was to remove
the surprise which would be occasioned hy seeing me alone
and to anticipate questions that it would be impossible forme
to hear without anguish mind and perturbation 
countenance i therefore took care to express myself in
such terms as should lead marguerite to believe that i had
voluntarily left her son in saxony and that in no very longtime
he would rejoin his family i trusted to subsequent
events to unfold the painful catastrophe and could not prevail
on myself to shock her maternal feelings so much as i
must necessarily do if i informed her the whole at once
charles had not been mentioned but in ordinary terms and
the accustomed language affection in the letters i had
recently received from constance and i was therefore convinced
that he had neither gone to that place nor had
conveyed thither any account his proceedings
the answer i received from marguerite by my messenger
was as follows 
 your absence has been long and critical and the welfare
 your daughters seems to require that we should rejoin
each other as speedily as may be whether we should
meet here or at any other place you must determine it
is however right i should inform you that during your
absence rumour has been busy with your reputation what
the extent or importance the ill reports circulated you
may be i am scarcely competent to judge we have lived
in uniform privacy and it is natural to suppose that the
portion censure that has reached us is but a small part
 what really exists the mode in which you have proceeded
and the extraordinary figure you have made in a
progress through germany have given weight to these insinuations
but it is not my intention to comment on
what you have done
you appear to design that i should understand you
have left my son behind you in saxony poor charles i
had a letter from him three weeks ago in which he informs
me what has happened and apologises in the most pathetic
terms for any seeming want regard to me in his
conduct at the very moment that his heart bleeds for my
fate i did not think it necessary to communicate this cir
 travels st leon
constance to you i have done with complaining now
that i have fallen into the worst and most unlookedfor
misfortunes i have a gratification that i do not choose to
part with in shutting up my sorrows in my own breast
oh charles my son my idol what is become 
you for what calamities are you reserved he tells me
it is necessary that i should never see or hear him again
never i his mother reginald there are some wounds
that we may endeavour to forgive but they leave a sentiment
in the heart the demonstrations which may perhaps
be restrained but which it is not in nature wholly to
subdue if i did but know where to find or to write to
my poor boy i would take my girls with me and partake
his honest and honourable poverty and never again join
the shadow him who was my husband forgive me
reginald i did not intend to say this if i should prove
unable to control the impatience my grief do not inflict
the punishment my offence on your innocent daughters

as to your fiction voluntarily leaving him behind
for further improvement it corresponds with every thing
you have lately attempted to make me believe i no longer
expect truth from you for seventeen years i had a husband
well well i ought not perhaps to repine i have
had my share the happiness which the present life is
calculated to afford
reginald i have not long to live when i tell you
this i am not giving way to melancholy presentiment i
will exert myself for the benefit my girls they will
have a grievous loss in me and for their sake i will live
as long as i can but i feel that you have struck me to
the heart my nights are sleepless my flesh is wasted 
my appetite is entirely gone you will presently be able
to judge whether i am deceiving myself the prospect
for these poor creatures who are at present all my care is
a dismal one i know not for what they are reserved but
i can hope for nothing good when i am dead remember
and be a father to them i ask nothing for myself i have
no longer any concern with life but if my dying request
can have weight with you make up to them the duty you
travels st leon 
have broken to me by all our past loves by the cordiality
and confidence in which we have so long lived by the
singleness and sincerity our affection by the pure delights
so seldom experienced in married life that have
attended our union i conjure you listen to me and obey
me in this
if i were deeply distressed for the loss my son if i
looked forward with a mingled sensation eagerness and
alarm to the approaching interview with my family it may
easily be imagined that this letter formed a heavy addition
to my mental anguish i confess i thought it a cruel one
marguerite might well suppose that the departure charles
was a circumstance i must strongly feel and she should
not have thus aggravated the recent wounds paternal
grief some allowance however was to be made for a
mother when we are ourselves racked with intolerable
pain that certainly is not the time at which we can rationally
be expected to exert the nicest and most vigilant consideration
for another add to which she was innocent
 the calamities she suffered and could not but know that
i was their sole author but whatever may be decided as
to the propriety the letter its effect upon my mind waseminently
salutary i instantly determined on the conduct
it became me to pursue
i lost not a moment from dresden to munich i had
advanced with slow and unwilling steps from munich to
constance i proceeded as rapidly as the modes travelling
and the nature the roads would permit i left my retinue
at the gates the town and flew instantly to the
apartments my family i hastened up stairs and as i
entered the sittingroom i saw the first and most exemplary
 matrons surrounded by her blooming daughters i instantly
perceived a great alteration in her appearance her
look was dejected j her form emaciated her countenance
sickly and pale she lifted up her eyes as i entered but
immediately dropped them again without any discernible
expression either congratulation or resentment i embraced
my children with undescribable emotion i said
within myself the love and affection i had reserved for
charles shall be divided among you and added to the share
travels st leon
you each possess my heart having saluted them in
turn i addressed myself to marguerite telling her that i
must have some conversation with her instantly my manner
was earnest she led the way into another apartment
i felt my heart overflowing at my tongue
tf i am come to you cried i a repenting prodigal
take me and mould me at your pleasure 
she looked up she was struck with the honest fervour
 my expression she answered in almost forgotten terms
and with a peculiar fulness meaning my husband 
it seemed as if the best years and the best emotions 
our life were suddenly renewed
most adorable women i continued c do you
think i can bear that you should die and i your murderer
no man in any age or climate the world ever owed so
much to a human creature as i owe to you no woman was
ever so ardently loved no woman ever so much deserved
to be loved if you were to die i should never know
peace again if you were to die the victim any miscalculation
 mine i should be the blackest criminals 
 reginald replied she i am afraid i have been
wrong i am afraid i have written harshly to you you
have a feeling heart and i have been too severe forgive
me it was the effect love affection cannot view with
a tranquil eye the faults the object beloved
let them be forgotten let the last six months be
blotted from our memory be as though they had never
existed 
she looked at me her look seemed to say though she
would not give the sentiment words that can never be the
loss charles and certain other calamities that period
are irretrievable 
 i resign myself into your hands i have been guilty 
i have had secrets meditations engendered and shut up in
my own bosom but it shall be so no more the tide 
affection kept back from its natural channel now flows with
double impetuousness never did i love you not when
you first came a virgin to my arms not on the banks 
the garonne not in the cottage the lake so fervently
so entirely as i love you now be my director do with
travels op st leon 
me as you please i have never been either wise or virtuous
but when i have been implicitly guided by you 
 i have wealth i am forbidden by the most solemn obligations
to discover the source that wealth this only
i may not communicate in all things else govern me despotically
 shall i resign it all shall i return to the
cottage the lake shall i go a houseless and helpless
wanderer to the farthest quarter the globe speak the
word only and it shall be done i prefer your affection
your cordial regard in the most obscure and meanest retreat
to all that wealth can purchase or kings can give 
cc reginald i thank you i acknowledge in your present
language and earnestness the object my first and
only love this return to your true character gives me all
the pleasure i am now capable receiving but it is too
late my son is lost that cannot be retrieved your reputation
is blasted i am sorry you are returned hither 
constance is in arms against you and i will not answer for
the consequence for myself i grieve to tell you so i
am ashamed my weakness but my heart is broken 
i loved you so entirely that i was not able to bear any
suspension our confidence i had passed with you through
all other misfortunes and the firmness my temper was
not shaken for this one misfortune that seemed the entire
dissolution our attachment i was not prepared i
feel every morning as i rise the warnings my decease
my nights are sleepless my appetite is gone from me
oh marguerite talk not thus distract me not with
the most fatal images our confidence shall return 
all the causes your malady shall be removed with the
causes the symptoms depend on it will disappear your
youth your tranquillity your happiness shall be renewed
oh no you shall not die we will yet live to love and
peace 
flatter not yourself with vain hopes my love i feel
something wrong within me which is rapidly wearing my
body to decay reconcile your mind to what very soon
must happen prepare yourself for being the only parent
to your remaining offspring i have composed my spirit
and calmly wait my fate you have now administered to
 travels st leon
me the only consolation i aspired to by this return to your
true character which affords me a sanguine hope that you
will faithfully discharge the duty to your offspring which
when i am gone will be doubly urgent on you
i was grieved to see that the mind marguerite was so
deeply impressed with the notion that she had but a short
time to live i could not bear to imagine for a moment
that her prognostic was just the thought seemed capable
 driving me to distraction i however conceived that
the best thing that could be done for the present was to
turn the conversation to some other topic
well well my love i answered there are some
things that are immediately pressing direct me direct a
husband so amply convinced your discretion what i am
to do at present shall i instantly annihilate all that has
made this unfortunate breach between us j shall i resign
my wealth from whatever source derived whither shall
we go shall we return to the cottage the lake shall
we retreat into some distant part the world 
how can you expect me said marguerite faintly
smiling to advise you respecting the disposal a wealth
 the amount which i am uninformed and the source
 which is invisible but i guess your secret the
stranger who died your guest was in possession the philosopher's
stone and he has bequeathed to you his discovery
i have heard this art though i confess i was not
much inclined to credit it i do not ask you to confirm my
conjecture i do not wish that you should violate my engagements
into which you have entered but upon putting
circumstances together which i have been inevitably
compelled to do i apprehend it can be nothing else i am
astonished that a conjecture so obvious should have offered
itself to my mind so late
if your wealth is any other nature ample as it apparently
is it is a natural question to ask to whom is it to
be resigned the ordinary wealth the world is something
real and substantial and can neither be created nor
dissipated with a breath but if your wealth be the
kind i have named let me ask is it possible to resign it 
a secret is a thing with which wq may choose whether we
travels st leon 
will become acquainted but once known we cannot become
unacquainted with it at pleasure your wealth upon
my supposition will always be at your beck and it is
perhaps beyond the strength human nature to refuse
under some circumstances at least in some emergencies to
use the wealth which is within our reach
it has been our mutual misfortune that such an engine
has been put into your hands it has been your fault to
make an indiscreet use it gladly would i return to the
tranquil and unsuspected poverty the cottage the lake
but that is impossible you have lost your son you have
lost your honest fame the life your marguerite is undermined
and perishing if it were possible for us to
return to our former situation and our former peace still
my reginald forgive me if i say i doubt the inflexibleness
 your resolution the gift unbounded wealth if
you possess it and with wealth apparently at least distinction
and greatness is too powerful a temptation nor
though i should trust your resistance could i be pleased ina
husband with the possession these extraordinary powers
it sets too great a distance between the parties it destroys
that communion spirit which is the soul the marriagetie
a consort should be a human being and an equal but
to this equality and simple humanity it is no longer in your
power to return
circumstanced then as we now are the marriage union
you must allow me to say irreparably dissolved your son
lost your fair fame destroyed your orphan daughters to be
provided for i know not if i should advise you ta forget
the prerogative that has been bought for you at so dreadful
a price beside if i am not mistaken there are great trials
in reserve for you i am afraid your present situation is
extremely critical i am afraid the suspicions you have
excited will cost you dear at all events i believe it to
be but a necessary precaution that we should fly from
constance i have nothing therefore to recommend to
you on the subject wealth but discretion i shall not
long live to be your adviser i shall always regard the
donation you have received you cannot wonder that i
should so regard it as one the most fearful calamities ta
 travels op st leon
which a human being can be exposed if you had used
your prerogative with discretion you might perhaps
though i confess i do not see how have escaped the obloquy
 the world into your domestic scene where the interest
is more lively and the watch upon you more unremitted it
must have introduced alienation and distrust as it is
i see you surrounded with dangers a thousand denominations
police has its eyes upon you superstition will
regard you as the familiar demons avarice will turn
upon you a regard jealousy and insatiable appetite if i
could recover from the weakness that at present besets me
and continue to live i foresee more and severer trials both
at home and abroad than any i have yet sustained and i
am almost thankful to that providence which has decreed
to take me away from the evil to comet
one thing further let me add i will speak it not in
the character a censor but a friend it must ever be
right and useful that a man should be undeceived in any
erroneous estimate he may make himself i have loved
you much i found in you many good qualities my imagination
decorated you in the virtues that you had not but
you have removed the veil an adept and an alchemist is
a low character when i married you i supposed myself
united to a nobleman a knight and a soldier a man who
would have revolted with disdain from every thing that was
poorspirited and base i lived with you long and happily
i saw faults i saw imbecilities i did not see them with
indifference but i endeavoured and with a degree success
to forget and to forgive them they did not contaminate
and corrupt the vitals honour at length you have
completely reversed the scene for a soldier you present
me with a projector and a chemist a coldblooded mortal
raking in the ashes a crucible for a selfish and solitary
advantage here is an all genuine dignity and the
truest generosity soul you cannot be ingenuous for
all your dealings are secrecy and darkness you cannot
have a friend for the mortal lives not that can sympathise
with your thoughts and emotions a generous spirit
reginald delights to live upon equal terms with his associates
and fellows he would disdain when offered to him
excessive and clandestine advantages equality is the soul
travels st leon 
 real and cordial society a man rank indeed does
not live upon equal terms with the whole his species 
but his heart also can exult for he has his equals how
unhappy the wretch the monster rather let me say who
is without an equal who looks through the world and
in the world cannot find a brother who is endowed
with attributes which no living being participates with
him and who is therefore cut off for ever from all cordiality

in the advice marguerite i saw that sound wisdom
and discernment by which in all the periods our connection
she had been so eminently characterised with her
views the future i was not disposed to accord i regarded
them as obscured and discoloured by the unfortunate state
 her health i could not indeed refuse to believe that
the prerogative i had received had been the parent much
domestic unhappiness willingly would i have resigned
all that i had derived from the stranger to be replaced in
the situation in which his pernicious legacies had found me
he had robbed me my son he had destroyed my domestic
peace he had undermined the tranquillity and
health the partner my life these calamities pressed
with a heavy and intolerable weight at my heart but if
as marguerite affirmed they were irretrievable or if they
could once be removed and the domestic advantages i had
heretofore enjoyed be restored i was not disposed to fear
those external mischiefs which marguerite so feelingly predicted
i could not believe that i should have such a
league foreign enemies to encounter nor could i easily
image to myself any external evils which it was not in the
power gold to remedy these considerations i urged to
my beloved partner and by enforcing them endeavoured to
remove those gloomy apprehensions from the prevalence 
which i feared much injury to her health there was
another circumstance i was led particularly to insist on j i
mean the nature the secret intrusted to me
p 
 travels st leon
tf i admire your discernment and ingenuity marguerite
said i in your conjecture respecting the source my
wealth i admire your delicacy in not pressing me to decide
upon the truth your conjecture this only i must
be permitted to say on that subject it is a secret and you
will perceive that the same reasons whatever they are
which make that secret obligatory on me require that it
should be respected by you the same evils that my own
indiscretion may draw on me i shall be equally exposed toby
any error or miscalculation yours i have therefore
most earnestly and solemnly to conjure you whatever misfortunes
may hereafter befall me in whatever perilous situation
i may be involved that you will never utter a syllable
on this subject and that as i am the selected depository 
this secret and alone know with certainty what is its nature
you will trust our prosperity in this point to me marguerite
engaged to conduct herself as i desired
the night which succeeded this explanation was particularly
soothing and grateful to me i was relieved from
a great and oppressive burthen i was conscious that
particular species pleasure which arises from the resolute
discharge an heroic duty the peace i felt within shed
its gay and reviving beams upon all around me reconciled
to myself i was filled with sanguine and agreeable
visions the future my mind obstinately rejected all
dark and hateful presages i had intrusted myself and the
direction my conduct as far as it was possible to that
better pilot under whose guidance if i had not avoided the
rocks and quicksands life i had at least escaped with
little comparative injury i felt therefore as if my domestic
enjoyments were restored and the pleasures my better
years were about to run over again their auspicious career
not so marguerite she was mild gentle and soothing
displeasure and resentment towards me were banished from
her mind she endeavoured to conquer her melancholy
and to forget the wounds that had been so fatal to her
hopes but her endeavours were fruitless a fixed dejection
clung to her heart nor could the generous sweetness
that pervaded her manners hide from me entirely what was
passing in her bosom
during this interval we had talked over the plan our
travels st leon
future operations marguerite was exceedingly urgent with
me to quit constance nor did i though not impressed
with her presentiments feel any reluctance to that change
 scene which i believed would materially contribute to
the serenity her mind and the restoration her health
we determined on some the cities italy as the next
place our residence and fixed if possible to set out
some time in the next day or the day after the plan 
proceeding to france which had lately been a favourite
with me was a favourite no longer that had been the
project cheerful and wanton prosperity it had had for its
object the reestablishment my family honours and the
elevation my son now my son was lost my wife was
oppressed with languor and disease my house was overwhelmed
with sorrow this was no time for wantonness
and triumph if i could ever hope to resume the plans
my frolic fancy had sketched an interval at least soberer
hue must first be suffered to elapse
my mind at this time sustained a revolution sufficiently
remarkable but which the urgency events that immediately
succeeded prevented me from ever ascertaining
whether it would have proved temporary or permanent
when i first received the donation the stranger my
thoughts as i have already said were in a state enthusiastic
transport and amidst the golden visions in which
my fancy revelled i became in a considerable degree alienated
from domestic sentiments and pleasures if i still
loved my wife and children it was the love habit rather
than sympathy more an anxiety for their prosperous success
in the world than an earnest craving for their presence
and intercourse this state intoxication and rapture had
now subsided the events the few last weeks had sobered
my thoughts having lost my son and being threatened
with the loss his mother i was roused to a sense
 their value the influx wealth and supernatural gifts
had grown familiar to my mind and now only occupied
the background the picture i was once more a man
and i hoped to partake the privileges and advantages 
a man the fate reserved for these hopes will speedily be
seen

the morning after my return to my family as i sat surrounded
with my girls and endeavouring to make myself
their playmate and companion certain officers justice
belonging to the supreme tribunal the city entered my
apartment they were sent as they informed me to conduct
me to prison my blood at this intelligence mounted
into my face
 to prison cried i wherefore what have i
done i am no citizen your state what is the charge
against me lead me not to prison lead me to your
chief magistrate 
f you will be called up for examination when his honour
is at leisure to hear you in the mean time you must
go to prison
do those who sent you know that i am a native and
a gentleman france they will be made to repent this
insolence upon what pretence do they dare to act thus 
f you will please not to talk insolence to us if you
do not demean yourself quietly 
silence fellow answered i fiercely lead the
way 
travels st leon 
by this time the children astonished at a scene so alarming
and unintelligible to them began to express their terror
in various ways julia who was ready to faint occupied
the attention her mother the little marguerite clung
round my knees and expressed her emotions by shrieks and
cries to see her father about to be torn from her by four
strangers the peculiarity whose garb office aggravated
the rudeness their countenances and the peremptoriness
 their behaviour was a spectacle which the affectionately
 her nature was unable to endure
ff i will go with you presently said i to the officers
ff see how you have terrified the children 
nay sir if you will behave civilly and make it worth
our while we do not desire to hurry you
i was stung with the brutal assurance with which they
thus set the liberty a few moments at a price to me but
i checked my impatience i felt that it would be both
foolish and degrading to enter into contention with such
wretches i turned from them proudly and took my child
in my arms
i will not be long gone my love said i these
people have made a mistake and i shall soon be able to
rectify it
i fancy not muttered one them surlily
they shall not take you away papa that they shall
not i will hold you and will not let you go 
e you are a good girl marguerite but i know best
what is proper and you must not think to control me
the men will not do me any harm child they dare not
perhaps i shall be back to dinner and mamma will then
tell me how good you have been
as i spoke she looked steadfastly in my face and then
flinging her arms round my neck cried goodby papa 
and burst into a flood tears
i embraced the other children and their mother and
saying to the latter significantly fear nothing you
know i have nothing to fear departed with my conductors

the way to the citadel lay through the marketplace
the scene was already crowded and i had the mortified

travels st leon
tin to be led along as a criminal in the midst a thousand
gazing eyes and enquiring tongues new as everything
connected with my present situation was to me i had
not anticipated this vexation i was stung with shame and
impatience to my dungeon said i to my conductors
sternly if you had shown yourself better humoured
cried the most brutal them we would have led you
round by the back way
the master the prison was somewhat less a savage
than his officers he knew my person and had heard 
my wealth does monsieur choose the best apartment
said he any where that i can be alone answered
i hastily he hesitated a moment i looked in his face 
oh yes you will be paid he bowed and showed
me to a room
i shut the door as he retired what had happened tome
was little importance in itself the impertinence 
bailiffs and thieftakers is no more real moment than the
stinging a gnat but i was so utterly unacquainted with
scenes this nature the pride rank that swelled
within me made every appearance restraint galling to
my sense from the instant i was able to write man no
one except in the voluntary compact military service
had ever said to me go there or do this and now
was i to be directed by the very refuse the species was
i to learn the prudence not replying to their insults 
was i to purchase at a stipulated price their patience and
forbearance i request the reader to pardon me for troubling
him with my noviciate feelings i soon learned to
understand the world the world a prison better 
but what was more importance i was apprehended
as a criminal i had been dragged a prisoner justice
through the streets constance i was by and by to be
subjected to the interrogatories the municipal tribunal
i could scarcely credit my senses that such an indignity
had happened to the blood st leon it is true i was
innocent i was conscious whatever might be my imprudences
and offences towards my own family that i had
done nothing to merit the animadversion public justice
but this was no consequence nothing in my opinion
travels st leon 
could wipe away the disgrace being interrogated examined
 having for an instant imputed to me the possibility
 being a criminal i writhed under this dishonour
and felt it as a severer attack than the question which was
comparatively ceremony and etiquette that had oppressed
me in my residence at dresden
the next day when i was brought up for examination
i had expected to be the complainant in demanding redress
for the injury i had sustained but i was mistaken

i entered the room haughtily and with the air a man
that felt himself aggrieved this however the magistrate
took no notice do you know sir said i that i ama
citizen and a gentleman france are you acquainted
with the treatment i have experienced have you lent
your authority to that treatment 
wait a few minutes replied he with an imperious
tone and i shall be at leisure to attend to you
i was silent after the interval nearly a quarter 
an hour he resumed
you call yourself the count de st leon 
i do
perhaps sir you are uninformed the purity with
which justice is administered in the city within whose jurisdiction
you now stand our state is a small one and its
magistrates are therefore enabled to discharge the office 
a parent not only to its proper citizens but to all strangers
that place themselves under its protection
i remember sir that seven years ago i and my wife
and four children sick and unfriended were upon the
point perishing with hunger within the walls this
city the fact i mentioned was wholly foreign to the
point with which i was at present concerned but the
parading arrogance the man brought it forcibly to my
memory and wrung it from my lips
monsieur le comte replied he you are petulant
it is not the office a state to feed the souls it contains 
it could not do that without making them slaves its
proper concern is to maintain them in that security and
freedom action which may best enable them to support
themselves
 travels st leon
i suppressed the emotions which the tone this speech
excited i was unwilling to enter into contention with a man
whom i regarded as inexpressibly my inferior
is it cried i sternly a part the justice you boast
 to drag a man rank and a stranger from his home
without any intimation the cause his being so treated
and then instead investigating immediately the charge
against him to send him to prison unheard i disdain to
mention the behaviour your officers those things naturally
grow out the abuses practised by their superiors
the mode our proceeding replied he depends
upon the seriousness the crime imputed if a man 
distinction labours under a slight accusation only we then
treat him with all proper forbearance and respect but
when he is suspected a crime more than ordinary
magnitude that alters the case the man who has ceased
to respect himself must look for no respect from others
i was for a moment thunderstruck and speechless at
length fiercely i cried produce my accusers 
that is not the mode proceeding in constance i
have certain questions to propound to you when you have
answered them we shall see what is to be done next
carry me before the princebishop your city if i
am to be examined further let it be by your sovereign 
the princebishop moved by the state our affairs in
matters religion has been prevailed on to delegate his
juridical authority i am the person to whom the cognisance
 your business belongs and at certain times aided
by my assessors have the power life and death within
this city you have had every indulgence to which you
are entitled and it will be your wisdom to be no further
refractory
propose your questions 
e a person apparently greatly advanced in years arrived
in the autumn last year at a miserable farm you at that
time cultivated called the cottage the lake it is to
him that my questions will principally relate
i stood aghast the words the magistrate were most
unwelcome sounds i remembered that the stranger had
said to me when i am once buried speak me and
travels op st leon 
if possible think me no more i replied with eagerness
and alarm
 that person i have nothing to say spare your
questions i have no answer to return you 
what was his name 
i know not
his country
i cannot inform you
it is understood that he died or in some manner disappeared
while under your protection yet in the registers
 the church there is no notice that event if he
died no application was made for the rites religion to
him dying or to his body when his spirit had deserted it
you are required to answer what became him or his
remains 
i have already told you that from me you will obtain
no information
one question more sir seven years ago you tell me
you and your family were perishing with hunger soon
after you removed from obscure lodgings in this city to
the cottage the lake and seemed to be laudably employed
in earning for yourself a scanty livelihood with the labour
 your hands but within the last six months the scene
is wholly changed you appear to have suddenly grown
rich and here and in other parts germany have actually
disbursed considerable sums whence comes this
change
the train questions thus proposed to me impelled me
to a serious reply
 monsieur le juge said i c i am a stranger a native
 france and a man rank in my own country i have
paid your state the compliment choosing it for my residence
i have expended my industry i expend my wealth
among you i have comported myself as a peaceable inhabitant
no action my life has brought scandal upon
your state or disturbed the peace and tranquillity your
affairs i cannot collect from any thing you have said
that i have any accuser or that any charge has been alleged
against me till that happens i cannot fall under
your animadversion i am a man generous birth and
travels st leon
honourable sentiments to myself and my own conscience
only am i accountable for my expenditure and my income
i disdain to answer to any tribunal on earth an enquiry 
this sort and now sir in conclusion what i demand 
you is first my liberty and secondly an ample reparation
for the interruption i have sustained and the insults to
which i have causelessly been exposed
you are mistaken sir said the magistrate what
you mention may be the rule administering justice in
some states they may decide if they think proper that
some open act apparently a criminal description must
be alleged against a man before he can become an object 
animadversion to the state but in constance as i have
already told you the government assumes to act the part 
a parent to its subjects i sit here not merely to investigate
and examine definite acts but as a censor morum and
i should violate the oath my office if i did not lend a
vigilant attention to the behaviour and conduct every one
within my jurisdiction the city constance requires
that nothing immoral licentious or suspicious character
shall be transacted within its walls your proceedings
have escaped notice too long much longer than they would
have done but for your late absence in cases where what
is committed is merely immoral or licentious we content
ourselves with sending the offender out our walls but
your case is a complicated nature it has scandalised
all the inhabitants our virtuous and religious city unless
you answer my enquiries and give a clear and satisfactory
account your wealth i am bound to believe that
there is something in the business that will not bear the
light the coincidence times obliges me to connect the
disappearance your guest and the sudden growth your
fortune this connection gives rise to the most alarming
suspicions i have therefore to inform you that unless
you honourably clear up these suspicions by the most ample
communication my duty directs me to remand you to
prison and to assure you that you will not be liberated
thence till you have satisfied the whole my interrogatories

c think deliberately answered i your decision
travels st leon 
before you form it your prisons i despise but i will
not suffer my reputation and my honour to be trifled with
i came before you willingly though i could easily have
avoided doing so because i was eager to clear my fame
i expected accusers and i knew i could confound accusation
but what is this that you call justice you put
together circumstances in your own mind you form conjectures
 and then without information accuser or oath
without the semblance guilt you condemn me to prison
and expect to extort from me confession in defect 
articles charge i disdain to answer the only return a
man honour should make to loose conjectures and random
calumnies is silence i am descended from a race 
heroes knights the cross and champions france and
their blood has not degenerated in my veins i feel myself
animated by the soul honour and incapable crime
i know my innocence and i rest upon it with confidence
your vulgar citizens habituated to none but the groveling
notions traffic and barter are not the peers st leon
nor able to comprehend the views and sentiments by which
he is guided
ee you are mighty wellspoken monsieur st leon replied
the magistrate and your words are big and sounding
but we know that the devil can assume the form an angel
and that the most infamous and profligate character can
pronounce with emphasis sentiments the purest virtue
you are pleased to decide that the presumptions against you
are nothing but calumnies is it nothing that having received
a stranger and retained him with you for months
you endeavoured to conceal this fact and never suffered
him to be seen by a human creature is his final disappearance
nothing is it nothing that supposing him to be
dead as he probably is you denied to his remains the rites
 funeral and refuse to tell what is become the body 
is it nothing that upon the death this stranger you
who were before in a state almost penury suddenly appear
to be possessed unbounded riches where is the
will this stranger in what archives have you deposited
the declaration his wealth let me tell you sir that
these presumptions which you call nothing form a body 
 travels st leon
circumstantial evidence that in many countries would have
led you to the scaffold as a murderer but the laws 
constance which you audaciously revile are the mildest in
the universe here we never put a man to death but on
his own confession we simply condemn him to perpetual
imprisonment or until he makes a declaration his guilt
you refuse to declare the name or country the man
whom you are suspected murdering and then have the
assurance to boast that no private accuser rises against you
no sir we know there can be no private accuser where the
connections the party can be successfully concealed but
shall this concealment which is an aggravation the murder
prove its security in conclusion you boast your
blood and heroic sentiments and rail at our citizens as
shopkeepers and merchants let me tell you sir shopkeepers
and merchants though we are we should scorn to
conduct ourselves in the obscure and suspicious manner
that you have done and now i have taken the trouble
to refute your flimsy pretences which it was wholly unnecessary
for me to do i have done with you you know
your destination unless you are prepared immediately to give
a satisfactory account yourself and your proceedings
finding it impossible to make on this man the impression
i desired i declined entering into further parley and
telling him that i should convey a representation my
case to my native sovereign and did not doubt soon to
make him feel the rashness his proceeding i withdrew
in the custody the officers who had conducted me to the
scene audience i was i confess struck with the coincidence
 circumstances which the magistrate had placed
in a light equally unexpected and forcible and which i
now saw calculated to subject me to the most injurious
suspicions i was not disposed in the smallest degree to
yield to the attack but i felt a desire to act deliberately
and with caution the whole what i had heard was
utterly unforeseen and it was with peculiar anguish that i
became aware this new consequence the stranger's pernicious
donation this was a consequence that no resignation
no abjuration his bequests could cure and that
must be stood up to with manly courage if any hope were
entertained averting it

chapter xxi
the appearance wealth that accompanied me had by
this time made its impression upon my keepers and one
 them now informed me that monsieur monluc an agent
 the court france who was making a tour several
 the german states hy order his sovereign had arrived
the night before at the city constance there was no
representative my country regularly resident here and
i immediately felt the presence monluc to be the most
fortunate event that could have occurred for effecting my
honourable deliverance selfishness and avarice it may bethought
would rather have impelled the persons who had
me in custody to conceal from me a circumstance calculated
to deprive them an advantageous prey but in
those groveling souls from whom riches never fail to extort
homage however strange it may seem the homage often
appears disinterested they pay it by a sort irresistible
instinct and admiring what they covet at an awful distance
with difficulty assume the courage to pollute their
worship with ideas calculation and gain
i immediately addressed a memorial to this gallant soldier
with whose person indeed i was unacquainted but
the fame whose spirit and enterprise had not failed to
have reached me i represented to him that i was a
frenchman family and distinction that i had been
seized upon and was retained in prison by the magistrates
here without accuser or the hope a trial that i had not
been guilty the shadow a crime and that i knew the
benignity and courage my sovereign would never permit
a subject france to languish under calumny and oppression
in a foreign country i added that he would do an
acceptable service to king francis to whom i had the honour
to be known by interfering in my favour and therefore
entreated him to obtain for me immediate justice and
deliverance monluc returned me an answer by the bearer
 my memorial assuring me that he would lose no time
in enquiring into the merits my case and that i might
travels st leon
depend upon receiving every assistance from him that a
man honour could desire
the warmth and frankness this answer filled me with
hope for there was no deliverance from my present situation
that i could contemplate with satisfaction but such
a one as should be accompanied with reparation and eclat
three days however elapsed before i heard again from the
french envoy on the morning the fourth he announced
his intention visiting me and about an hour after
arrived at the prison his appearance was striking he
was tall slender and well made with a freedom carriage
not derived from the polish courts but which appeared
to flow from the manliness and active energies 
his mind his hair and complexion were dark the former
though he was still young rather scantily shaded a high
and ample forehead his features were expressive the
sanguine and dust temper his mind and though his
eye was animated his countenance as he entered struck
me as particularly solemn
 you are the count de st leon said he
i am
you sent me a memorial a few days ago complaining
 the tribunal this city i am afraid sir i can do nothing
for you
my countenance fell as he spoke i gasped for breath
i had conceived a most favourable anticipation as he entered
and my disappointment was particularly cruel i
had said in my heart this is the very man to rescue my
injured fame
i see sir you are disappointed resumed he
have not given up the affair if i had this visit which i
design as a mark attention would be an insult the
moment i received your memorial i paid the utmost regard
to it if the affair had been as you represented it i
know i could not do any thing more acceptable to my sovereign
than interfere in your behalf i have spent the
whole interval in investigating the case i have seen the
magistrate who committed you i have visited the spot
where your crime is alleged to have been perpetrated i
have had an interview with your wife
travels st leon 
well sir cried i alarmed and impatient well
sir and the result 
appearances are uncommonly strong against you they
can scarcely be stronger but you have a right to be heard 
it is for the sake discharging that last act justice that
you see me this morning
f great god exclaimed i overwhelmed with chagrin
f is if possible that my countryman the man to whom i
was proud and happy to appeal the gallant monluc should
believe me a murderer i swear by every thing that is
sacred by the blood him that died for me on the cross
and by my eternal salvation that i am as innocent as the
child unborn 
i am glad to hear you express yourself with this emphasis
and fervour i cannot but say that to my own
feelings it has great weight but i must not suffer myself
as a man and still less in the public capacity in which i
stand to heovercome and confounded by your asseverations
there is a connected and most unfavourable story against
you this it is incumbent on you to clear up
and you say you have seen my wife i was distracted
and overwhelmed by monluc's way putting the
question i was divided between my anxiety to be justified
and the solemn mystery the affair to which his enquiries
led and i probably spoke thus from an unconscious desire
to gain time
 yesthat is another presumption in your favour madame
de st leon is perhaps the most striking and extraordinary
woman i ever saw the husband such a woman
especially when he appears to be the object her attachment
i should be always inclined to think well madame
de st leon pleaded for you with earnestness and affection
but amidst all her ardour i could perceive that she felt
there was something mysterious and unpleasant in the affair
that she was unable to developed
as monluc spoke i saw that i had failed in one the
main anchors my hope i thought that no one could
have talked with my beloved marguerite and have left her
with the opinion that i was a murderer how did this happen
 was she lukewarm and unfaithful in my vindication 
 travels st leon
what she continued my countryman i could see
was not only unable to explain hut did not fully understand
it is you alone can clear the concealment the
stranger his disappearance what became the body and
your own sudden transition from poverty to wealth
i was by this time fully sensible the nature my
situation i summoned my fortitude i felt that i had no
longer any hope but in the dignity innocence
you call on me for explanation replied i can
you not conceive gallant monluc that i may be able to
resolve your doubts and yet that i will not explanation
is not the business a man honour he cannot stoop
to it he will win the applause and approbation mankind
if won in silence he will hold on the even course
 a generous spirit and turn neither to the right nor to the
left to court the suffrage or deprecate the condemnation 
a giddy multitude such my brave countryman have been
the maxims my past life such will be the maxims 
my future
i admire answered monluc at least the gallantry
 these sentiments though i may be inclined to doubt their
prudence but if such is your determination permit me
to say you have no concern with me he who resolutely
withholds explanation must arm himself with patience and
either wait the operation time or rest satisfied with the
consciousness his innocence
and is that all will there not be some noble spirits
who separating themselves from the herd will judge 
him by what they feel in their own breasts and be drawn
to him with an irresistible impulse was it not natural
that i should expect monluc to be one these it would
be hard indeed if he who disdains to temporise with
popularity and to vindicate himself from the ungenerous
constructions sordid minds should not by that very proceeding
secure the friendship and sympathy those whose
friendship it will be most grateful to him to possess
the friends an innocent man whom a combination
 circumstances has exposed to the most painful suspicions
must always be few he can scarcely expect the acquittal
and sympathy a stranger i must know i must have
travels st leon 
felt and observed in a man a thousand virtues before i can
be entitled to treat accumulated presumptions against him
as nothing
and thus then are to my hopes in monluc he
does not feel that i am innocent he does not recognise
in me the countenance the voice the turn thought a
brother a man no less incapable than himself every thing
disgraceful and ignominious be it so i will as you advise
me rest upon the consciousness my innocence a
frenchman the descendant illustrious ancestors long an
exile long the victim adversity but at all times conscious
 the purity my sentiments and the integrity my
conduct i will not suffer myself to be overwhelmed with
this last desertion this ultimate refusal justice 
count de st leon your appeal is full energy in
whatever way i decide it will leave an unpleasant sensation
in my breast let us suppose that as a private man
i could take you to my arms and dismiss every unfavourable
appearance from my mind you must remember that
i am here in a public character and that only in a public
character am i capable affording you assistance thus
situated i am bound to resist the impulses a romantic
and irregular confidence and to do nothing which i shall
not be able to render a clear and intelligible account
tf let us not part thus it is not the vindication 
your character to the world with which we are at present
concerned it is only necessary that you should furnish a
sufficient ground to justify me to myself for interfering in
your behalf explain to me the particulars your casein
confidence if you will but fully and without reserve i
will not abuse your confidence i will make no use your
communication but such as you shall yourself approve
only enable me to have a reason for acting that is not
merely capable being felt but that i may know is in its
own nature capable being stated to another it is upon
me that you call to take certain measures you must enable
me to judge their propriety
you are mistaken when you suppose the appearances
against you to be slight it is not a slight circumstance
that you profess to be ignorant or have refused to disci

 travels st leon
close the country the connections and even the name 
the stranger whom you so anxiously concealed the disappearance
 his body is still more extraordinary what
intelligible motive except a guilty one can i assign for
that but your sudden wealth immediately after this disappearance
is especially material it is a broad and glaring
fact that men cannot shut their eyes on if they would
the chain and combination events that proceeds systematically
from link to link is the criterion guilt and
the protector reputation your case as it now stands
is scarcely to be termed equivocal upon the supposition 
your criminality all is plain and easy to be accounted for 
upon any other supposition it appears an inscrutable mystery
place but the balance even present to me an exposition
 these facts that shall make your innocence not less
probable than your guilt and as i feel myself interested
for you and your family and as the presumption when
matters are doubtful ought always to be on the favourable
side i consent to be your friend 
how unfortunate i exclaimed am i doomed to be 
your proposal is liberal and generous but i must refuse
it my story is an unhappy one particulars have been
reposed in my fidelity which i am not at liberty to communicate
but which if communicated you would not regard
as dishonourable i may be made the martyr infamy
and the abhorrence my species i can endure
adversity and anguish i can die but that which you
demand from me never can be confided to any mortal ear 
as you please rejoined monluc the secrets a
dead man to be preserved after his death and that to the
ruin him who is their depository must i believe be
villanous secrets and the secret a villain no one is bound
to observe you must further give me leave to tell you
that whatever a high strained sense honour might dictate
in that point the fortune you possess is your own affair
and to dissipate or not the mystery which hangs upon that
is wholly at your discretion but i have already advanced
as far perhaps further than circumstances or propriety
could justify and there can now be no more parley between
us
travels st leon 
monluc cried i i submit however harsh your
decision is as towards me however painful and unfortunate
its consequences i will admit it to be that which duty prescribes
to you i struggle i contend no further one
thing only i would willingly obtain you that you would
interpose your influence to obtain for me the society and
intercourse my family the transaction this day will
then be remembered by me with respect towards you and
a melancholy regret that i could riot entitle myself to your
esteem i shall recollect with pleasure that i owe something
to the generosity monluc
incredible pertinacity exclaimed my visitor with a
voice perplexity and astonishment what am i to
conceive you under what appearance shall i consider
you in the records my memory your silence is the indication
 guilt and in that indication i ought to acquiesce
yet the fortitude your manner and something i
know not what emotion that your manner produces in
my own bosom would fain persuade me you are innocent
why will you leave me a prey to this contention thought
if all men constituted as i am were to feel in you as it
were the magnetism innocence shame the simple inference
 understanding and the general sense mankind
would oblige them to treat you as guilty what i can
however be assured i will cheerfully do for you i cannot
deliver you from prison but i will not fail to obtain the
mitigation you ask farewell 
such was the issue my interview with monluc it
was clear that my reputation was wounded beyond the power
 remedy while the question had only been a magistrate
haughty supercilious insolent and unfeeling i flattered
myself that the harshness the conclusions that were
drawn might be ascribed to the depravity his character
but monluc was the reverse this man he was not less
generous and heroic than the magistrate was gross and illiberal
his desire to relieve me was not less apparent than
the magistrate's eagerness to oppress yet his conclusion
was the same and was felt by me so much the more bitterly
in proportion to the humanity the kindness the intrepidity
and the virtue the man from whom it flowed
q 
travels st leon
virtue and vice barbarism and refinement were equally
engaged in the concert against me and there was no chance
i should triumph in a contention with so many enemies
i might now be said to have reached the my adventure
 i had closed one grand experiment upon the
donation the stranger what had it produced to me 
not one atom the benefits i anticipated not a particle 
those advantages which a little while ago had made the in
toxicationsof my waking dreams its fruits had been distasteful
and loathsome whether i looked to my person
my family or my fame i had felt in all the miserable
effects this treacherous and delusive gift my person
was shut up in prison and i was now to make an experiment
whether by clandestine and secret proceedings wealth
could restore to me the liberty which wealth had deprived
me my family was blasted my wife was struck to the
heart and no mortal skill could restore the wound she had
suffered my son was gone unaided into voluntary exile
that he might shun the contagion my follies what was
i to do with the poor remains my house forlorn dejected
and wretched the wound my good name had
received was the most decisive species when i first
encountered contumely at dresden and was called on for
explanation by coligny the difficulties my condition
struck anguish to my soul but what were they compared
with what had now overtaken me i was charged with
robbery and murder with every thing that combines the
whole species against the perpetrator and determines them
without sense compunction to extirpate him from the
face the earth perhaps it was only by the courtesy 
the laws this state that i was permitted my choice between
an ignominious death and perpetual imprisonment
i might possibly indeed escape from my confinement i
might pass into a distant country i might be fortunate
enough to cut off all connection between my past and my
future life and thus enter upon a new career but this to
a man honourable mind is a miserable expedient with
what feelings does he recollect that there is a spot where
his name is abhorred where a story is told against him to
excite the wonder the ignorant and the torpid feelings 
travels st leon 
the sluggish soul a story to darken with new infamy the
records guilt and to infect the imagination the solitary
man with nameless horrors to be the theme such a
tale is no common evil no matter how far the man to
whom it relates shall remove from the detested spot the
spot itself with all its chain circumstances will often
recur the voices that repulsed and humbled him will ring
in his ear the degraded figure he made will rise for ever
fresh to his imagination he cannot ascend to any free and
lofty sentiment he cannot attain the healthful tone unblemished
virtue j wherever he goes he carries the arrow
 disgrace in his bosom and when he would erect his head
on high it reminds him the past and stings him to the
heart
if the consciousness all this would have been painful
to any other man what was it to me who had been
brought up from my infancy in the opinion that fame was
the first all human possessions and to whom honour
and an unimpeached integrity had ever been more necessary
than my daily food or than the life which that food supported
 what would i not have given could i have returned
to the situation in which the inauspicious arrival the
stranger had found me but that was impossible if all
that i had recently passed through could but have proved a
dream if i could have awakened and freed myself from the
phantoms this horrible vision how happy beyond all
names happiness should i by such an event have been
made what a lesson would it have taught me the
emptiness and futility human wishes what a sovereign
contempt would it have impressed upon me for wealth and
all its train ostentation how profound a feeling contentment
with humble circumstances and a narrow station
would it have produced in my mind alas the conception
 those advantages and that peace was the illusion and not
the evils i had sustained and from which i could not
escape 
q

meanwhile it was necessary that i should make the best
 the present circumstances my heart was wounded my
spirit was in a manner broken but not so utterly withered
and destroyed as to make me rest supine in perpetual imprisonment
i felt with equal conviction and pungency
that my character and my happiness had sustained the
deepest injuries but i felt it incumbent on me to collect
and improve the fragments that remained for some days
indeed after the conference with monluc i was sunk in the
deepest dejection but as that dejection subsided i began
to turn a steady attention upon the future i recollected
that an eternal and inexhaustible gift deserved to be made
the subject more than one experiment before a decision
was formed upon its merits i shall become wiser said i
as i go forward experience however bitter will teach
me sagacity and discrimination my next experiment shall
be made with more prudence and a soberer gradation i
will remove to some distant country where the disadvantages
 my past adventures shall not follow me i will
take a new name i shall then enjoy the benefit a tyro
just entering a scene to all the personages which he is
wholly unknown i shall be like a serpent that has stripped
its tarnished and wrinkled skin and comes forth in all the
gloss and sleekness youth surely in an unknown land
with the prejudice wealth in my favour and no prejudices
against me i shall know how to conduct myself so as
to obtain honour and respect it is impossible that inexhaustible
wealth and immortal youth gifts so earnestly
coveted by every creature that lives gifts which if i were
known to possess my whole species from the mere impulses
 envy would probably combine to murder me as not able
to endure the sight one so elevated above his brethren
it is impossible that such gifts should not be pregnant with
variety joy
marguerite greatly contributed to raise me from the
dejection into which my imprisonment and the conference
travels st leon 
 monluc had sunk me she was my better genius i
had been so accustomed to receive consolation from her lips
in the most trying circumstances that now the very sound
 her voice was able to smooth my wrinkled brow and
calm my agitated spirit i listened as to the sound an
angelic lyre i was all ear i drank in the accents her
tongue and in the dear delight my cares were hushed
and my sorrows at an she talked to me her daughters
whom she represented as about to have no protector
but their father she urged me to watch over them and to
take such steps as should most conduce to their future virtue
and happiness she pointed out the practicability 
escape and recommended to me to fly to some distant
country the dreams future prosperity from the gifts 
the stranger were not hers they were all my own it was
inexpressibly affecting at this time to receive consolation
from her who had no consolation in her own breast who
had bid farewell to all the gay attractions the world and
talked familiarly her death as a thing certain to happen
in no very long time she had lost the purest gratifications
 the domestic scene she had lost her son her heart
was broken yet with her dying accents she sought to dispel
retrospect and inspire cheerfulness in the breast her
husband
the reader may perhaps imagine that i was something
too sanguine when surrounded with jailors and all the
precautions a prison i planned the nature and scene 
my next residence exactly as if i had been a person at
large but i took it for granted that the power money
i possessed would easily unlock to me the gates my captivity
i believed that upon the lowest calculation personal
liberty was clearly included among the gifts the
stranger impressed with this opinion t fixed upon a
negro a servant the prison and who had the keys my
apartment as the subject my pecuniary experiment the
idea applying to him had perhaps first occurred to me
from the mere circumstance my seeing him more frequently
than any other attendant the prison when i
thought further the matter i judged from the meanness
 his rank and his apparent poverty that i could not have
 travels st leon
chosen better so far as related to the sum to be paid as
the price my liberty it was indeed indifferent to me
whether it were large or small i had however suffered so
much from the inconsiderate lavishing wealth that i had
no inclination on the present occasion to make ostentation
 more than was necessary but what was most importance
to me i was desirous that my first experiment
should be a successful one though not unaware the
power gold i conceived that among persons middling
rank and easier circumstances there might be varieties
 disposition and i might be mistaken in my choice
some might have the whim integrity or might place a
sturdy sort pride in showing that they were content with
what they had and were too high for a bribe there
might be persons who though plebeian rank might value
reputation as much as ever i had done and be opinion
that no advance station could compensate for the name
or the consciousness dishonour these distinctions may
seem an idle and superfluous refinement when it is considered
that i had the power raising my bribe to the level
 any man's honesty or pride be it as great as it might 
and it may be thought that my offer might be so increased
as to be too dazzling for mortal firmness to resist be that
as it will i am merely stating the reflections that passed
through my mind not entering into their vindication
taking the first opportunity then accosting this man
when he was alone with me i addressed him thus 
my good friend are not you poor 
yes sir
would not you readily do me a kindness 
if my master give me leave i will
you mistake me would you be my friend 
e i do not know what you mean sir i have been used
to call the man i love my friend if you mean that you
know i cannot choose whether i wil be a man's friend it
comes itself
 can i not make you my friend 
that is make me love you 
i was surprised at the propriety his answers i am
unable at this distance time to recall the defects his
travels st leon 
language and i disdain the mimic toil inventing a
jargon for him suitable to the lowness his condition the
sense what he said i faithfully report i had before been
struck with a certain correctness thinking in him 
but i now examined his countenance more attentively than
i had ever before done and thought i could distinctly
trace in it the indications a sound understanding and an
excellent heart
i do not know sir continued he if i see that
you are a good man i believe i shall love you but if it
happened that you were good and generous to me i am sure
i should love you very much
 you are very poor 
so they tell me i never had more than a shilling or
two at a time in my life
it is a very sad thing to be poor 
fe why yes so i have heard sir but for my own
part i am always merry and gay
my good fellow i will make you rich
thank you sir but what good will that do me 
f you are a servant i will make you a master 
servants
now that i should not like at all i am merry because
i am lighthearted if i had money and property
to take care and servants to direct i am afraid they
would make me grave and suspicious and in every respect
unlike what you see me
es is it possible you should be pleased with your present
situation under the orders one man in a house and
obliged to play the tyrant to the rest 
why as you say sir there may be more agreeable
situations than the life a jail but as to being under
orders i have no objection to that i never knew any other
condition and therefore i am contented it is not pleasant
indeed to have a master who is always scolding and dissatisfied
 but the gentleman i serve at present is reasonable
 i know how to content him and when i have done
that he leaves me to please myself you offer me money 
now sir that is not what i call being generous i count
nothing for much except when a man shows me has bowels
 travels st leon
and convinces me that he thinks justice due even to a
negro i dare say however you designed it for generosity
and expected something from me in return tell me what
it is you want and whatever i can do with propriety you
may depend on it i will
do you approve a man's being deprived his
liberty 
 will you please to tell me what you mean by liberty 
you offered me just now what you called liberty and independence
 and i am content to be a servant
would you be pleased instead being a turnkey to
have the key turned on yourself
that i should not i understand the disagreeableness
 that well enough for when i first entered this place it
was as a prisoner
if then my good fellow you were convinced that i
was a man disposed to be generous to you in your own
way and to deserve your attachment and love surely you
would not refuse to deliver me from a situation which you
have yourself felt to be so disagreeable and calamitous

genius temper in this one particular assumed the guise 
cunning never did he tell his love in the ear any indifferent
auditor assiduously did he avoid pronouncing
even the name her to whom he was attached in any
other case he would have announced to me his inclinations
and previously demanded my leave absence for his excursions
but love seemed to him imperiously to command
privacy and he employed every imaginable precaution to
prevent me and all human beings from knowing whither he
went or that he was absent at all
in one his visits to his fair donzella he happened incautiously
to drop some very remote hint the scenes hi
which he had just been engaged with me in my secret
grotto the curiosity the girl was strongly roused she
questioned him further he started and was terrified to
recollect what he had said i had strictly enjoined him
secrecy towards every member my family my precaution
had extended no further for as i have said i
scarcely knew that he had the most casual intercourse with
any person beyond my own roof but hector naturally
dreaded that what i was so earnest to conceal from everyone
in my house he would be highly to blame to communicate
to a stranger he therefore peremptorily refused
and with many signs distress to say another word on the
subject
the donzella piqued at his resistance had recourse to
female arts she was cruel she uttered words sharp
displeasure and disdain she knew that a person who refused
her such a trifle could not have an atom regard for
her she commanded him never to see her more unsuccessful
in these expedients she had recourse to expedients
 a different sort she wept she called him base falsehearted
and unkind she saw he was determined to be the
death her she was seized with strong fits sobbing
and hysterical affection in the midst all this he was
as unmoved as a rock marble he interpreted everything
that passed in its most literal form he felt more
severely her unkindness and sympathised more truly in her
distress than perhaps any human creature would have done
but no further could she gain upon him the confidence
travels st leon 
 his master was in question and he would sooner have
died upon the rack than run the slightest risk betraying
it
from these arts she descended to arts more congenial to
the habits her life she summoned all her skill to perplex
him with cunning and insidious questions from her
questions he ought to have fled but this hector was incapable
he was distressed by her severity he grieved for
the unintentional pain he had caused her all these circumstances
melted his heart and he could not resolve upon
anything that was not considerate and respectful towards her
as the framing artful questions was the stronghold 
the donzella and she might have challenged in this article
the most hoary practitioner the quibbling bar so it was
exactly the weakest side upon which poor hector could be
attacked his simplicity yielded him up a defenceless prey
to the assailant least all human undertakings was he capable
 detecting the various faces a doubtful question
and guarding himself against the traps an insidious
foe it was not till the fourth interview from hector's original
hint that the donzella had recourse to this species 
attack and she did not withdraw her forces till she had
extorted from him all he knew
when hector found that all his guards were baffled and
put to flight he had then recourse to the only expedient
that remained conjuring her by every thing sacred and
every thing tremendous not to betray a trust she had so
ungenerously obtained from him she readily promised
every thing he desired soothed by her compliance he
determined not to mention to me the lapse which he had
been guilty it would in his opinion have been little less
than treason to suspect his dulcinea indiscretion or
frailty in the breast this miracle nature was not his
loyalty as secure as it could be even in his own why
then should he betray the secret his love which had
never yet been confided even to the senseless air why
should he subject himself to the inconceivable anguish and
confusion owning where my interests or where my
wishes were concerned that he had been found tripping
and imperfect why should he inflict a pain or cause
travels op st leon
in me a fear which he knew and he only could know
was groundless thus it happened that had one more
confident what i purposed should be secret than i was
myself in the smallest degree advertised 
the consequences this indiscretion my servant were
not slow in rendering themselves visible the donzella
was by no means so scrupulous or delicate in her sentiments
as my humble but faithful attendant as she had
given her company to hector she had had an opportunity
 observing in him such integrity and goodness heart
as could not fail to extort the esteem any human being
she really honoured him she was unwilling to give him
any cause uneasiness but she had another lover perhaps
she had more the laws chastity she regarded as
prejudices and believed they were never formed for persons
in her situation in society she was opinion that the
more lovers she had provided she satisfied them all the
more completely did she improve the talents with which
heaven had endowed her few women have any secrets
for the man they admit to their embraces in an hour 
amorous dalliance she communicated to agostino the ostler
all that she knew the conjurations and spells monsieur
boismorand such was the name i had assumed upon my
entrance into italy her communication was probably attended
with cautions imitated from those with which hector
had so industriously loaded the donzella in the preceding
example perhaps the illustrissimo agostino had another
mistress with whom he thought it would be unjust to
practise greater reserves than the donzella had done with
him be that as it will the rumours which were whispered
to my prejudice speedily got air and it may be were repeated
with the greater avidity on account the mystery
that attended them and the injunctions secrecy with
which they were accompanied
travels st leon 
chapter xxv
italy may be considered as the very focus and parent 
superstitious credulity the materials which hector had
furnished after all the interrogations the donzella were
slight compared with the superstructure which was presently
erected on them my grotto was said to be the appropriated
haunt where a thousand devils held their infernal
sabbath the terrified imagination the rustics listening
with a temper horribly distracted between curiosity and
alarm created to itself fictitious bowling arid shrieks and
saw pale and sulphureous flames dancing upon the surface
 the stream poor hector was early the victim their
cruel and untamed ignorance they believed that the peculiarity
 his complexion rendered him a singularly agreeable
intercessor between me and my infernal familiars
the colour charon was similar to that my confidential
attendant and he like hector fell under the calumnious
misconstructions the affrighted villagers conspicuously
noble affectionate and useful as he was the
jaundiced eye superstition metamorphosed him into a
devil the storms thunder and lightning to which the
climate in which i resided is particularly subject acquired
new terror from the ill fame which now pursued the name
 monsieur boismorand at those times the shapeless
form monsters vomiting smoke and flames were visible
to the neighbourhood sometimes scudding along the blue
tops the distant hills and at others with audaciousness
incredible brushing even at the elbow the almost lifeless
clowns and dairymaids and then suddenly dissolving into
air their place no longer marked but by the noisome and
deadly stench they left behind all the misfortunes the
district were imputed to me the mortality cattle the
convulsions and death children and the pale and lingering
decay persons recently advanced to an age puberty
innocent and blameless was my conduct to all
around us often was i forward and eager for the relief 
 travels st leon
the poor and afflicted never was i the author the
slightest inconvenience or prejudice to any yet nothing
merely human could be hated in the degree in which i was
hated few were daring and intrepid enough to repeat the
very name i bore and when it was inadvertently pronounced
it produced through the whole extent the
astonished circle an involuntary and supernatural shudder
agostino the first lover who had made an impression on
the heart hector's donzella was as i afterwards found
a fellow a gloomy and ferocious disposition a true italian
spadaccino determined that none should perpetrate an affront
against him with impunity but should expiate in
some refined and cruel vengeance the levity by which they
had been so unfortunate as to give birth to his hatred he
by no means relished or approved the liberal and goodhumoured
sentiments the donzella often had they inflicted
on him the darkest torments jealousy nor had he failed
at least in one preceding instance to make his rival the
victim his resentment the donzella however went on
in her career she was light heart gay in temper and
careless consequences she had always hitherto succeeded
by playful blandishments or more serious demonstrations
 contrition in mollifying the temper her
brute and every pardon she received operated with her asa
new permission to offend she did not sufficiently consider
that she was thus continually raising to a higher pitch
the frenzy his malice hector in the mean time was
utterly unconscious and ignorant the perilous situation
in which he stood while to the apprehension agostino
the giving him a negro for a rival whom his pride regarded
as belonging to an inferior species beings and his devout
ignorance likened to the leader the infernal squadrons
was the last and most intolerable insult
his malice was ingenious and subtle he disdained the
vulgar revenge stabbing his antagonist in the dark and
supposing that his enmity could be gorged by a blow
when the venom his nature was thoroughly put in motion
nothing could restore it to quietness and tranquillity but
some mighty stroke to excite the wonder every bystander
and that should leave behind it a track deso
travels st leon
nation never to be filled up again and erased he heard
therefore with unsated appetite and eager joy the tale necromancy
and infernal machination repeated to him from
hector by the donzella the impression which the narrative
produced upon him was a mixed sentiment 
transport at the apprehension such an instrument 
vengeance and palpitating hatred superstition teaching
him to believe and to view with abhorrence that which he
desired to render tenfold more an object faith and aversion
to his neighbours he struck an auspicious and august
alliance between his revenge and his religion his religion
exciting him to exterminate that the destruction which
would produce inexpressible gratification to his revenge
the darkness his spirit led him to proceed with double
caution and vigilance in his correspondence with the dondella
he discovered nothing to her the dark project
which was engendering in his mind and only betrayed so
much his superstitious feelings and fears as by giving
new emotion might stimulate her to gratify his curiosity
and her own by a detection further particulars he was
assiduous in the underhand and sinister propagation the
tale to which he did not fail to give his own colouring and
affix his own feelings he was desirous that the train
should be laid in silence and that the explosion he designed
should be free from all presignification the event thus
an individual whose animosity i had no apprehension
and the meanness whose appearance would probably have
made me neglect all precaution against him gave method
and direction to an evil which however upon a review
i am not inclined to doubt i should have been the victim
if the enmity and industry this individual had been
wholly withdrawn
the mischief was long in preparation before i received
in any way the slightest intimation the predicament in
which i stood the first circumstance at all calculated to
excite alarm in my mind was the singular manner in which i
found myself regarded if i entered any the neighbouring
villages or met the rustics and their dames as i strayed
along the roads or the fields they fled my approach deserted
the streets and carefully shut themselves up in their
 travels st leon
houses till i had passed where it was impossible to
avoid me they bowed themselves to the earth in the most
submissive guise before me while the most lively terror
was painted in their countenances dreading lest they should
excite the resentment a tremendous and inexorable foe
these tokens however were far from inspiring me with a
conception the truth they perplexed they astonished
they distressed me sore as i was with my recent afflictions
my mind was but too fully prepared for anticipations 
evil i had suffered from suspicions i had suffered from
calumnious imputations i had suffered from the malignant
effects popular rumour had i yielded my confidence
to any person but such a one as hector it is probable my
suspicions would have turned on that side but my reliance
on him was not less than that which alexander the great
yielded to philip the physician i knew his rectitude his
simplicity his fidelity and the singleness his heart and
i could not harbour the shadow a doubt respecting him
my reliance was that entire and perfect sort which did
not express itself by a recollection the physical possibility
and an acquittal founded in deliberation but by a total
vacancy doubt or retrospect that way directed just
such as the state my mind would have appeared if the
thing had been naturally impossible
i was not however ignorant and raw enough to be deceived
by the exterior homage i have described i sufficiently
knew that what i beheld was the offspring 
hatred to feel one's self hated is in all instances a painful
and humiliating state the human mind to me it was
especially so i was not formed to retaliate this species 
injury i could not hate in my turn i was formed to
love i could not look upon my species with dark and
gloomy contemplations i was prompt to admire their
virtues and perhaps even too prompt to extenuate their
errors it may i believe be laid down as a rule that
they who cannot hate can least endure to be made objects
 hatred fettered however as i now was by the tenderest
consideration for the health and tranquillity marguerite
i thought it best to temporise and submit in silence
my principal anxiety was to hide these symptoms from the
travels st leon
notice my family this i could not completely effect 
some them were too glaring and obtrusive entirely to
escape the observation my daughters in their walks but
the filial forbearance they felt towards their mother led them
implicitly and without any concerted plan to concur with
me in my exertions for her quiet
the animosity agostino was restless and inextinguishable
his plans did not terminate in exciting against
me a secret and covered abhorrence they aimed at nothing
less than my utter destruction the next exertion the
conspiracy which was engendering against me was a tragical
nature
it happened one night after all my family was retired
to rest and i was myself sunk into a slumber that i was
suddenly alarmed at the report a musket which seemed
to be fired almost under the window my chamber this
was a very singular circumstance and calculated to convey
an impression danger i leaped from my bed and ran
to the window the night was extremely dark and everything
seemed perfectly quiet presently i discerned a
glimmering light like that a lantern which however appeared
to be gradually retiring to a greater distance i was
not thus satisfied but determined to hasten down stairs and
investigate the cause the disturbance marguerite who
had heard the firing the musket as well as myself now
called me to her and entreated me not to expose myself to
unnecessary danger in compliance with her remonstrances
i promised though unwillingly not to go out into the
court or upon the lawn but to content myself with examining
the state every part the house when i came
to the staircase and the hall i found that the alarm had communicated
to almost every person in the family who presently
assembled round me we parole the house but
found every thing in the situation in which it had been
left and nowhere any appearance violence i opened
several the windows but all was darkness and silence
having thus far satisfied myself i listened with a degree
 amusement to the conjectures and sage remarks several
 the servants a rank society who may usually be found
to derive a degree enjoyment from incidents this sort
 travels st leon
which for the moment strikingly tend to level all artificial
distinctions and confer on every one the liberty uttering
his reflections without apprehension or constraint i did not
however feel myself entirely easy the circumstance which
had just occurred combined with the forebodings which
had lately impressed me had filled me with undefinable
terror and alarm hector would willingly have gone over
the grounds contiguous to the house to see if he could discover
any thing that related to or could explain the incident 
but i had promised marguerite that i would search no
further and the temper my mind would not suffer me
to expose another to a danger which i abstained from encountering
in my own person it was more than an hour
before the conclave in which we were assembled broke up
and every one retired fatigued with attention and prepared
to fall into the soundest sleep my dreams were uneasy
and disturbed my mind was in a tumult imaginary
calamities and i passed the greater part the night in a
state singular anxiety
in the morning i was scarcely sunk into a refreshing
slumber before i was suddenly roused from sleep by a
repetition shrieks astonishment and distress i put
on my clothes as quickly as i could and hastened towards
the spot from which the sounds appeared to proceed the
first object i beheld was the little boy ten years old
whom charon had a short time before dragged out the
river stretched along upon the lifeless body this faithful
and generous animal the musket the report which
had alarmed us the night before had no doubt been aimed
against charon and the greater part its contents appeared
to be lodged in his body as no further sound had succeeded
the firing he had probably been killed on the spot
he was at a small distance from the house near a private
footpath where he had been found in the morning by the
lad whose life he had recently preserved the poor boy
had not at first understood what had happened to his benefactor
but only thought him asleep and prompted by
affection for the generous creature had quietly sat down by
him till he should awake he had not sat long however
before he discerned about him the marks blood he
travels op st leon 
put his hand to the wound the animal stirred not he
passed to his head he saw his eyes fiery and starting and
his lips distorted he endeavoured to awake him as one
would awake a human being to whom some mischief had
happened which he was not aware all his efforts were
fruitless he found his body motionless and his joints
stiff in death the apprehension what had occurred
then suddenly flashed on his mind he burst out into
shrieks astonishment and anguish hector was the first
person who caught the sound and hastened to the spot i
immediately followed the poor negro who in the innocence
 his heart was uninitiated in the proud distinctions
by which civilised man is taught to place so vast a barrier
between the human nature and the brute was struck speechless
with sorrow and amazement he recognised the dead
being before him for his fellowcreature he recollected
in him his friend his companion his intimate acquaintance
between whom and himself there had for some time passed
an uninterrupted reciprocation acts kindness and
assistance
a morose and fastidious reader perhaps will ask me why
i lay so great a stress upon so petty and insignificant an
incident as the death a dog it might have been little
to other persons it was not little to us let the reader
recollect his ingenuity in procuring aid for his dying master
his gratitude to the person by whom that aid was afforded
and his unconquerable antipathy to his master's murderer
these are not common traits there are many men whose
premature fate has been the most unrelentingly avenged
that in moral and useful qualities could not have stood the
comparison with my generous charon it surely was no
common cause for regret that a creature who had distinguished
himself by a conduct so peculiarly admirable should
have encountered so premature and unmerited a fate his
conduct the reader may in some degree comprehend and
appreciate j but i should in vain attempt to delineate those
admirable qualities in this faithful domestic which do not
fall within the province narrative and which to have
justly appreciated you must have been personally and familiarly
acquainted with him beside ours was a family
t
 travels st leon
 love as we were affectionately attached to each other
so we never admitted a servant under our roof who did not
prove himself by his conduct utterly unworthy to whom
we did not extend a share that friendship and affection
which seemed to be the right every one that dwelt in our
family feeling does not stay to calculate with weights
and a balance the importance and magnitude every
object that excites it it flows impetuously from the heart
without consulting the cooler responses the understanding

there was another circumstance which rendered the
catastrophe this generous animal great moment to us
it was a clear proof that there was somewhere a strong
animosity at work against his master it was impossible
he could himself have provoked his fate never was a
creature more gentle and inoffensive though his bulk
was great and his strength uncommon the energies he
possessed were always employed in acts justice and beneficence
never in acts aggression but if a hatred were
at work so busy and fierce as to prompt an action like this
how were we to estimate it what was its source and
whither did it tend these were very interesting and
serious considerations we however dwelt for some time
longer in the centre general antipathy and abhorrence
without being able in the smallest degree to explain to ourselves
what we saw as we knew not in what we had
offended we were unable to atone for our fault or even to
guard ourselves against the repetition it nor were we
by any means prepared to comprehend the extent our
danger happily marguerite whose health was now in a
rapid decline was least exposed to the observation this
new mischief though she felt enough it to confirm her
in the sentiment that she had nothing fortunate and happy
to look forward to in the small remainder her existence

chapter xxvi
it was no long time after the death charon that hector
came home one evening in a state the most violent
anxiety and trepidation he burst upon me in my study
where i was sitting alone buried in one those deep
reveries which especially since the legacy the stranger
had been among the most frequent habits my mind
his perturbation was such as to render it impossible for
him to impose on himself the smallest degree caution
and restraint the noise he made in entering the apartment
startled me i looked up and perceived his features
swelled his face bruised and his garments disfigured with
blood
for heaven's sake hector exclaimed i what is
the matter 
he answered not he advanced towards the upper 
 the room he took down a pistol one those which i
always kept loaded in my apartment he came towards me
he fell upon his knees he tendered the pistol to my acceptance

 hector cried i what am i to understand what
is the meaning this 
kill me dear master for christ's sake i entreat
you to kill me 
i took the pistol from his hand it pointed towards
the floor
and will you not kill me in a mournful accent
exclaimed he
what have you done that deserves that i should kill
you 
t 
 travels st leon
fc kill me only kill me pray kill me he spread
out his hands towards me with a gesture intreaty
 hector what means this agitation what has happened
 you terrify me beyond expression
f e must i speak replied he must i be the accuser
 my guilty self he burst into an agony tears
f would were dead would i had been torn into a
thousand pieces before this had happened indeed sir
i am innocent i thought no harm indeed it is not
my fault 
what have you done whence come these bruises
and this wound 
it is all my fault it is all my doing nobody
else why will you not kill me 
hector i cannot bear this uncertainty recollect
yourself be pacified and tell your story 
will you forgive me 
forgive you what what have you done to deserve
my anger 
no no i do not wish to be forgiven i only wish
you to abhor to detest to curse and to kill me 
 this is beyond all patience
i never loved any body but you and my mistress and
my dear young ladies i never did any body else the
least atom mischief and now my folly will be the ruin
 you all 
pardon me sir i will torment you no longer i
will get the better myself and tell you all that has happened

he then informed me though with many breaks and
passionate interruptions what he had just discovered
my evil repute as a necromancer the many strange and
terrible stories that were circulated me the antipathy
universally entertained against me the active ferociousness
with which this antipathy was accompanied and the
consequences that he feared would result he ascribed
the whole to his own imprudence and to the particulars
which the superior cunning the donzella in spite his
invincible refusal to acquaint her with a single circumstance
had wrung from him hector had collected several
travels st leon 
 these particulars accidentally from a neighbouring rustic
and had been vehement in my defence while they were
eager in debate others had joined them but hector had
found them all opponents not one a supporter irritated
with the contest and the opprobrious language heaped
upon himself and his master hector had been provoked to
strike the most insolent the disputants immediately
several had fallen upon him at once and it was owing to
the uncommon strength and dexterity he possessed that
he had escaped alive out their hands beside innumerable
blows with fist foot and stick he had received
two or three stabs in different parts the body from the
knives with which the italian is too much accustomed to
assail his adversary it was easy to see that the gallant
and generous defence hector had considerably augmented
the danger my situation they dismissed him with a
thousand execrations against both him and myself and
vows that they would sign ah se their vengeance by setting
fire to my house having related his story hector concluded
with again earnestly conjuring me to kill him that
so he might expiate the imprudence and folly by which he
had made himself the author my calamity
the excessiveness the poor fellow's distress excited
me to employ every effort to pacify his mind hector
said i you have been very imprudent but i foresee no
such consequences as your terrified imagination has led
you to forebode the idle threats clowns in the midst
 their brawls are entitled to little regard i am not so
weak and infirm soul as to be moved from my tranquillity
by their senseless prate i entertain no doubt 
your fidelity and affection i am not angry with you
the fault you have been guilty arose from no defect 
vigilance or attachment you did what you could and
where you failed it was only in that to which your powers
were not commensurate you have done well and wisely
now in acquainting me with particulars and the whole
extent the danger doubt not but i will employ such
precautions and be so awake to my situation as to forestal
the possibility mischief
thus i endeavoured to assuage honest hector's per
t 
 travels st leon
duration but with no adequate effect he hung his head
in sorrow and refused to be comforted shame and terror
assailed him together and he knew not how to support
their united pressure he intreated me not to lull myself
in fancied security and fall blindfold on my ruin he entreated
me not to forgive him my clemency and forbearance
served only to make him regard with greater
horror the crime which he had been guilty if however
i refused to punish him and by penance or death to lighten
the remorse that hung upon his heart he would at least
devote himself in opposition to the evil he had created
and die rather than it should touch a hair our heads
this idea he seemed to view with some complacency but
the pleasure it gave was a glimmering and momentary
light he could not remain in any place for an instant 
he wrung his hands with anguish and exhibited every
feature the deepest despair i examined his bruises and
wounds the latter which though attended with a copious
effusion blood did not appear to be dangerous i warned
him to be guilty no further indiscretion to betray nothing
 what had happened to any one my family and
to engage in no further controversies and broils in my
vindication
though i endeavoured to make light what i heard
in compassion to the distress my servant yet when i
came to reconsider the subject in solitude it by no means
appeared to me in a light and trivial point view one
part hector's story had related to the death charon
who i now found had owed his fate to the superstition
 my uncultivated neighbours i had always entertained
a formidable idea the character an italian populace
whom i regarded as more suspicious sanguinary and
violent than any other race men in the world i deplored
my fate that exposed me to their rage i deplored
my folly that had admitted any confidant into my
individual pursuits though my confidence had been so
limited and its receiver so trustworthy that i could not
have imagined any evil would have resulted i determined
that i would not expose myself to the risk such
sinister consequences as in my opinion might in my pretravels
 st leon 
sent situation easily overtake me i grieved for the tender
health and the doubtful state mind my beloved
marguerite which alone opposed themselves to the adoption
 an immediate change scene in the state her
health i had been grievously disappointed i had looked
for amendment i found decay the decay however was
gradual almost imperceptible from time to time i had
even flattered myself that the progress was in an opposite
direction but the delusion was soon banished another
difficulty arose in addition to the rest marguerite appeared
pregnant a circumstance that now first presented
itself after a cessation ten years
the morning after the accident and disclosure hector
i went to pisa determined to consult with the marchese
filosanto elder brother the unfortunate andrea who
was probably more accurately acquainted with the italian
character than myself and understood the shades that
character as they were modified in the particular territory
in which i resided the marchese was a man universally
admired for subtlety reasoning vigorousness comprehension
and refinement taste in the structure his
mind he was scarcely an italian he had resided several
years in england and was the intimate friend henry
howard earl surrey who some time after fell a victim
to the jealous tyranny his native sovereign king henry
the eighth the marchese was frank generous and disinterested
and possessed more fully the affections every one
within the circle his friendship than any other man i ever
knew he was a sanguine temper always contemplating
the world on its brightest side and from the generosity
 his own heart incapable crediting a distant danger
or discerning the storm in the embryo cloud where it
was silently engendering
in the conference we held i was influenced too implicitly
by my consciousness his integrity and the gigantic
powers his mind and did not sufficiently advert to
those peculiarities in his temper which i have now described
the external facts with which the narrative hector had
furnished me i fully detailed to him as to my particular
pursuits i contented myself with stating that i indulged
t 
 travels st leon
freely in the study chemistry and was those persons
ordinarily accounted visionaries who amused themselves
with the expectation finding rhe philosopher's stone
having heard my story to an the marchese ridiculed
my apprehensions he saw nothing in the facts that
alarmed me but a cowardly superstition whose utmost flight
reached no higher than the shooting a dog and a squabble
between a boisterous rustic and a servant too acutely sensitive
for the reputation his master he assured me
that the days such superstition as i contemplated were
long since past and that his countrymen less deserved the
imputation than any others as living at the very centre
and source catholic imposition they saw deeper into the
mystery and were not exposed to the advantage which distance
possesses for augmenting our reverence he expatiated
with great eloquence on the vice a suspicious
temper a spirit alarm and continual apprehension
like the jealousy lovers he said made the meat it fed
on it brooded over plots that had no existence but in the
wanderings a disturbed imagination it was continually
interrupting the quiet its owner and the tranquillity 
society and for the sake avoiding imaginary evils
often plunged into such as were real he advised me to
go home and be contented he recommended to me to
clear up the clouds my mind and cultivate a light
heart a cheerful temper and a generous confidence in the
honest sympathies mankind in fine he bade me continue
my pursuits avoid eclat and trust in his sagacity
that no ill consequences would ensue
the remonstrances the marchese filosanto led me to
suspect that i had been idly credulous i had too easily
participated the feelings and apprehensions a poor uninstructed
negro and had suffered the secret griefs that
brooded in my heart to discolour my perceptions and
aggravate the features circumstances in themselves trifling
or indifferent i began to be half ashamed the
gloominess my conceptions i could not alas follow
the advice the marchese as to the cheerfulness my
heart but i could exert myself to prevent my present
melancholy from disfiguring to me every thing i saw the
travels op st leon 
influence exercised over my conceptions by persons eminent
intellect has always been great not that the judgment
i formed the powers my own mind was peculiarly
humble but i reasoned thus perhaps the person i
consult is as well informed in the subject under consideration
as i am in that case his decision is as fully entitled
to attention as my own and thus without cowardly selfcontempt
on my part the general balance the argument
was materially altered perhaps without being on the
whole my superior he may be more competent to this particular
question in either case my idea its merits became
perceptibly modified i never listened to the sentiments
 a man talents when they differed from my own
unless where he was evidently visionary and irrational
without being shaken as to the credit due to my own view
 the subject
such then was the effect produced on me by the marchese's
expostulation i shook off my apprehensions and
laughed at my fears i was ashamed the want gallantry
that had possessed me when i meditated flight
from so trivial a menace i concluded that dangers particularly
such as arise from the irrational passions a capricious
multitude were increased when symptoms apprehension
discovered themselves and abated when received
with neglect or repelled with a magnanimous serenity
chapter xxvii
meanwhile the unrelenting agostino was fixed in his
purpose and incessant in his machinations he believed
that the destructive mine was now sufficiently prepared
and that he might proceed in all surety to the ultimate
explosion he apprehended that he had advanced too far
to retract that the death charon and the assault upon
hector were calculated sufficiently to announce what was
to follow and that it would be injudicious and idle to grant
me much respite for reflection the passions his associates
were wrought up to a frenzy horror and needed
travels st leon
only a bold and artful director to urge them to any point 
fury and destruction
implicitly as i had confided in the decision the
marchese i had speedily reason to know that it was the
dictate too sanguine and presumptuous a spirit on
my return from his palace and on several subsequent
occasions i found the manners the populace altered
respecting me they no longer viewed me with a sort 
reverential awe or fled my approach they insulted me
with their eyes they muttered curses upon me in a voice
sufficiently audible to be understood they broke forth in
gestures abhorrence and derision they regarded me
with looks ferocious hatred and when i had passed them
their murmurs gradually swelled into shouts triumphant
contumely these symptoms however were progressive j
each day became more odious and intolerable than the last
they who have never been placed in a situation like mine
will never be able to do justice to my grievance they
will perhaps say that the calamity i now endured was a
trifling one and that a weak mind only can be elevated by
the acclamations and huzzahs the multitude or depressed
by their hisses and scorn i did not and i could not feel
it so there is no pleasure more congenial to the human
heart than the approbation and affection our fellows i
call heaven to witness that i could mount the scaffold surrounded
with an innumerable multitude to applaud my fortitude
and to feel as it were on their own neck the blow that
ended me and count it a festival but i cannot bear to be
surrounded with tokens abhorrence and scorn i cannot
bear to look round me through an extended circle and see the
impatience despite in every face man was not born to
live alone he is linked to his brethren by a thousand ties 
and when those ties are broken he ceases from all genuine
existence their complacence is a food more invigorating
than ambrosia their aversion is a torment worse than that
 the damned while i write i seem again to hear resounding
in my ears the hooting and clamours these
infatuated peasants when heard indeed they went to
my heart and sat there colder than the aspic's venom they
rose to my throat with a sensation bitterer than wormwood
travels st leon 
they unstrung all my muscles and nerves i could not stay 
i could not fly i wished myself buried deep in the centre
 the earth i felt something worse more revolting more
opposite to all the prejudices and propensities the soul
than annihilation i have known in various situations and
conditions human life what it was to be distressed to be
dejected to be miserable but never in any other situation
have i felt a misery so concentrated so gnawing and insufferable

i began however like the critics i am figuring to myself
to despise the pusillanimity my submission and to believe
that if i would only make a stand and turn round
upon my enemy i should subdue him this resolution i
could with difficulty have taken in the moment attack 
it was formed in an interval retrospect and reflection
having formed it the contempt i should have felt for myself
would have been too exquisite if i had failed to put it
in execution i was not long at a loss for an opportunity
in one my walks i found myself pursued by a numerous
populace with a peculiar degree inveteracy i yielded
for some time till i came to a place that appeared convenient
for the purpose haranguing them it was a
bench placed upon a rising ground and sheltered behind
by a thicket which had been erected for the purpose 
commanding a neighbouring prospect i stopped i
stepped upon the bench i waved my hand towards the
multitude they perceived my purpose with some degree
 confusion and surprise they drew nearer do not
listen to him do not hear a word he has to say cried
some them oh hear him hear him exclaimed
others i obtained an audience
what is the cause said i all this hatred and
persecution 
because you are a wizard a necromancer a dealer in
the black art because you are in league with hell and
have sold yourself to the devil i answered twenty voices
at once
ft hear me replied i and i will convince you my
innocence but hear me in silence and do not interrupt
me
travels st leon
te for myself i have no belief in the existence such
an art
this remark produced a general groan
why should i have sold myself to the foe mankind
what could he give me that should compensate me for
consigning myself over to him for ever hereafter the
power exhibiting strange and extraordinary tricks
what a pitiful recompence but if i had bought this
power at so dear a price should i hide it should i not
take every opportunity exciting your reverence and astonishment
who has seen me perform any wonderful
feat i live quietly among you and give no cause offence
to any i live retired in the midst my family i
foi no party or connections i do not intrude into any
 your affairs political or private i do not even enter
into conferences with any you unless induced by the
apparent occasion doing some good and benevolent
action
f quit then this ungenerous persecution do not turn
the fury your resentment upon a harmless stranger 
you are italians the most polished and ingenious people
on the face the earth the most glorious monuments 
art in building in statuary and in painting are to be
found in the midst you ancient italy governed the
world by her arms modern italy governs the world through
the medium that pure and sublime religion which
providence has graciously made her the repository do
not stain the glory this character show yourselves
worthy the honour with which your name is heard in
every corner the habitable world 
while i was yet speaking a large clot mud reached
me and struck me on the face and the upper part my
breast i calmly endeavoured to free myself from its effects
with my handkerchief and looking round me demanded
in the sacred spirit conscious innocence how
have i deserved this treatment 
thus far i had been heard with a doubtful sentiment
 murmur and approbation and i began to feel that i was
rather gaining ground upon my audience but this new
insult seemed to turn the tide popular impression in an
instant
travels op st leon 
villain renegade accursed god i heard from
every side did not you bewitch my cow did not you
enchant my child have not you killed my daughter 
down with him exterminate him do not suffer him to
live
i continued my efforts to be heard it was a critical
moment a last experiment upon the power firmness and
innocence to control the madness infuriated superstition
it was in vain i was deafened with the noise that assailed
me it was no longer shouts and clamours disapprobation
it was the roaring tigers and the shriek 
cannibals sticks stones and every kind missile weapon
that offered itself fell in showers around me it seemed a
sort miracle that i escaped instant destruction i eluded
their pursuit after some time time i ventured to return to
my own house i had in the interval terrified myself with
the idea that having missed my person they might have
hurried thither and executed some terrible vengeance on
my helpless family i found them however in safety the
mob had for this time contented itself to disperse without
further mischief
as soon as it was dark i hastened to pisa and related
what had just occurred to my friend the marchese he
was surprised but he still adhered to his opinion he
had never supposed he told me that a noisy and clamorous
mob was a proper subject upon which to make experiment
 the energy truth and he laughed at my attempt to
reason them out their superstition but they meant
nothing by all that had passed it was the mere foam and
fury a moment poured out with vehemence and then
dissipated in air a certain set politicians had for their
particular ends represented a mob as a terrific and formidable
engine alas they were rather to be pitied than condemned
there was no malice in their hearts they
were in reality a mere material machine led on without
reflection and when they had committed a momentary
ravage astonished themselves the most at the injury they
had perpetrated they were as light and variable as a
feather driven with every breath and nothing could argue
greater obliquity intellect than to suppose because they
 travels st leon
were in a certain temper and sentiment today that they
would be found in a similar temper and sentiment tomorrow
the marchese however wished he said to relieve me from
the apprehension this imaginary danger and therefore offered
me the whole suite his servants for the defence my
house he added that among his friends and retainers in
the city pisa he did not doubt in an hour's time to be able
to raise a troop four hundred men and whatever power
 that sort he possessed he assured me was wholly at my
service i was not convinced by the marchese's arguments
but i declined his offer i could not bear to think that
blood should be spilled and the lives these poor ignorant
wretches sacrificed for the preservation a thing so worthless
in my eyes as the local property i possessed i therefore
told the marchese that i might perhaps wait yet a day
or two longer before i formed my resolution but that the
instant i saw one fresh symptom the hostility the villagers
i was determined to take my family with me and
remove far beyond the reach both their terrors and their
hatred
i staid two hours with the marchese and then set out to
my own house the way i took was by a private road
open only to the neighbouring gentry but which my
servant carried the key it led along the higher ground
and commanded a view the common highway considerably
before i reached my own habitation i was struck
with the appearance persons passing in considerable
numbers and in a tumultuous manner along the public
road some them were armed with clubs and others
with torches their inarch however led not towards my
house but in an opposite direction i mended my pace
terrified with a sort vague apprehension what might
have happened though i did not disguise to myself that
what i saw was not precisely that which i might have expected
to see if they had been returned from demolishing
my property and burning my house
when i arrived i found indeed that no mischief had
been actually committed but that i was indebted for the
preservation my house and perhaps for the lives my
wife and children to the sagacity and presence mind 
travels st leon 
bernardin the servant my early years my residence
had been the object against which the march the populace
had been directed bernardin perceiving their intentions
had with great difficulty prevailed upon hector to
keep out sight nothing could be more adverse to the
feelings and inclination my faithful negro but bernardin
having convinced him that his appearance would
only exasperate the rage the assailants and that perhaps
every thing importance to his master's service and happiness
depended at present upon his concealment hector
yielded to his representations this accomplished bernardin
next assembled the gardener and one or two labourers
in my employment who happened to be at hand and
having furnished them with firearms stationed them at
different windows in the front the house with these
preparations when the mob arrived he resolutely told them
that he would fire on the first person that attempted to break
in they were staggered furious as they appeared the
moment before this threat held them in awe they paraded
two or three times round the house clattering their
arms and pouring out vehement execrations and then
withdrew solemnly promising that they would return the
following night and level the house with the ground
i no longer yielded the smallest degree credit to the
unsuspicious and confiding philosophy the marchese
filosanto i sent off my wife and children before daybreak
for lucca determined to take shipping at the first
convenient port and pass over into spain i was little
solicitous for reasons with which the reader is already acquainted
about my property and moveables i had no motive
to induce me to fetter and clog my retreat at this hour
 peril and terror with a single article rarity and price
my furniture indeed was not splendid but it was handsome
and valuable and the indifference with which i resigned
the whole to the mercy chance was a matter some
surprise to the persons around me my servants offered
to defend my possessions at the peril their lives but i
peremptorily forbade it i would not even consent to
their taking away certain articles by way appropriating
them to their personal use i believed that if i admitted
travels st leona
single act that sort i should find it no easy matter to
set limits to their avidity and as i had determined to
take none my present servants with me the negro and
bernardin excepted i feared that the apparent possession 
a single article that had been mine might hereafter mark
its proprietor a victim to the senseless rage blindfold
superstition i could easily make up to these honest and
faithful dependants the injury they might sustain from the
seeming severity this order i determined to shut up
my house with all its present contents as joshua the
captain the jews drew a line separation round the
profane possessions achan and to leave the villagers if
so it seemed good to them to make the whole a burntoffering
to propitiate the wrath their avenging divinity
the directions i issued being unhesitating and peremptory
met with a ready submission from all my other domestics
hector only the mild and complying hector 
whom obedience had hitherto appeared to constitute the
very soul met my commands with a resolute refusal the
present distressed appearance my fortunes seemed to
have worked the poor fellow's mind to a paroxysm insanity
he considered himself as the sole author my
calamity ile reviled himself in the bitterest terms 
compunction and abhorrence the language which the
agony his soul forced from his lips was such as could
not fail to impress upon my other servants a conviction 
the justice the imputations that were now brought against
us this however was little importance i must at all
events have been contented to leave behind me in my present
neighbourhoods name loaded with the execrations 
religious fanaticism hector imprecated upon himself a
thousand curses if so long as he continued to live the populace
should lay hands upon a straw my property he
would not move so much as an inch from the defence my
house he would either by preserving it expiate in some
degree the mischief in which he had involved me or fall and
be crushed to death in the midst its ruins arguments
and expostulations were useless here his mind was worked
up to too high a tone to be susceptible the patience necessary
for hearing or understanding any reasoning that was
travels st leon 
addressed to him authority itself was no avail for
the first and the last time he threw off the character a
servant and appeared obstinate selfwilled and ungovernable
it was only by direct violence that he could be forced
from the spot i gave him in charge with the most strict
orders not to suffer him to escape from their custody to two
 his fellows
this business being despatched i went at the invitation
 the marchese to a small cottage he possessed at no great
distance from my own house its situation was so private
and retired that few persons knew or could perceive that
there was any building on the spot here therefore i could
remain in the most perfect safety i felt myself unaccountably
impelled to stay and witness the catastrophe the
tragedy i should not have been satisfied to continue in
uncertainty as to what it would prove after all that had
passed like the marchese i should have been apt to accuse
myself cowardice and a mind soured and degenerate if
the mob had not put their threats in execution the marchese
himself was well pleased with my determination in
this respect he was not yet convinced that i had not
painted to myself a danger which had no adequate counterpart
in the world realities
i had not long to wait the night had no sooner spread
an evencoloured and almost impervious veil over the
world than the marchese as if moved by a secret impulse
to witness what he yet refused to believe came to me at the
cottage he had scarcely arrived when he heard the confused
murmurs and turbulence the populace for we
were near enough to distinguish almost every thing as
they did not meet with the defence the preceding evening
the work they had undertaken was presently despatched
we saw the flames ascend we recognised the
shouts infernal joy with which they witnessed the catastrophe
when the marchese beheld what till seen he
would never admit to be possible he burst out into a sort 
transport misanthropy he exclaimed that no innocence
and no merit could defend a man from the unrelenting antipathy
 his fellows he saw that there was a principle
in the human mind destined to be eternally at war with 

travels st leon
provement and science no sooner did a man devote himself
to the pursuit discoveries which if ascertained
would prove the highest benefit to his species than his
whole species became armed against him the midnight
oil was held to be the signal infernal machinations the
paleness study and the furrows thought were adjudged
to be the tokens diabolical alliance he saw in the
transactions that night a pledge the eternal triumph
 ignorance over wisdom above all he regretted that
his countrymen his dear italians should for ever blot their
honour and their character by such savage outrages
though myself the principal sufferer i was obliged to perform
the part the comforter and consoler and endeavour
to calm the transport agony that seized upon the susceptible
filosanto he was astonished shocked and beside
himself i viewed the whole with the gloomy firmness 
a desperate resolution
the worst event this detested evening remains yet
unrecorded even now i tremble while i attempt to
commit the story to my harmless paper so far as related
to the mere destruction my property i looked on with a
philosophical indifference i had no reason and i disdained
to regret the loss that which i had it in my
power to repair in a moment i thought i had taken care
that no human life should be risqued upon this critical
occasion but i was mistaken i learned the next morning
with anguish inexpressible that hector the negro 
the prison constance was no more he had eluded
the vigilance his keepers no sooner was he at liberty
then he hastened unknown to every one to die as he had
declared he would in the defence my house the mob
had burst into the house they seized him alive they
dragged him out in the midst them they insulted over
him as the special favourite the infernal king they
inflicted on him every species mockery and torture 
they killed him joint by joint and limb by limb the
pen drops from my lifeless hand
what right had i to make this man the victim my
idle and unhallowed pursuits what has the art and
multiplication gold in it that should compensate the
travels op st leon 
destruction so ingenuous so simplehearted so noble a
creature if i had myself fallen into the hands the
populace it had been well i was a criminal worthy 
every retribution they could inflict upon me some men
perhaps will ask why i lamented so bitterly over so uncultivated
and uninformed an individual as this negro
there was however something so truly tragical in the fate
to which this creature in his generosity and remorse devoted
himself that i believe for the moment i felt a
sharper pang in it than in the strange and extraordinary
loss my only son or perhaps in the premature death 
my beloved marguerite
chapter xxviii
before the dawn the succeeding morning i turned my
face towards lucca i beheld the last cloud mingling
smoke and flame ascend from the ashes my villa the
blaze sunk its materials were nearly consumed and it
yielded an uncertain and fitful light only when i withdrew
from being any longer the melancholy and heartwounded
spectator the ruin i took an everlasting leave the
marchese i had been introduced to him under a friendly
aspect as the man who had had courage to perform the
last offices humanity to his unfortunate brother and
he had conceived a warm affection for me the painful
nature the catastrophe he had witnessed melted his heart
and he earnestly pressed me to draw upon him for any
supplies i wanted or rather to receive from him a sum
equivalent to the damage the superstition his countrymen
had inflicted on me this i positively refused but
i found it impossible to silence his importunity till i
submitted to the duplicity promising that if i found
myself reduced to any necessity i would not fail to apply
to him it was in the very moment our separation
that intelligence was brought me the fate hector
the reader may imagine with how heavy a heart i set out
on my journey
it 
travels st leon
lucca is about seventeen miles from the city pisa 
from the place where i had spent the greater part this
memorable night it was twenty the marchese made me
promise to take a serpentine and circuitous route the more
completely to elude the possibility future danger an
adventure occurred to me in this passage with the relation
 which i will not interrupt my narrative which prevented
me from arriving at lucca till the noon the
following day suffice it to say that it was such a
nature that impatient as i was under my present extraordinary
circumstances to rejoin my family i should have
held myself destitute every atom humanity if i had
not submitted to this short delay
short as it was i found when i reached lucca that
my evil genius had been busy to accumulate for me new
misfortunes marguerite and her daughters were wholly
unknown in this place and the intelligence the pisan
riot having reached lucca in the course the day it was
related to my wife as to a hearer unconcerned with all its
horrid circumstances and the calamitous fate our generous
hector by the hostess the inn the rapidity events
during the last part our residence in the pisan territory
was such as to have obliged me to say little the effect
they produced upon marguerite but the reader can
scarcely be so inadvertent and unreflecting as not easily to
imagine to himself that she felt them in the highest degree
painful and overwhelming this last blow was too much
marguerite had been some months pregnant she was
immediately seized with the pains labour and delivered
 a dead child the first intelligence communicated tome
upon my arrival was that my wife was dying
lucca however did not witness the period her existence
after having continued for several days upon the
very extremity as it were between life and death she
grew perceptibly better and in a week more though in a
very feeble state it became apparent that her case was nota
rapid one we agreed to proceed upon our spanish
voyage it appeared not improbable that the seaair might
be found beneficial and the experiment was warmly recommended
by her physicians they were not however
travels op st leon 
aware the whole extent her disorder during the
voyage her crisis returned with such malignant symptoms
as scarcely to permit us the hope she would reach the land
alive we debarked at barcelona on the th april 
we had no sooner taken up our abode inthis city than
fully aware the state her disease she assembled her
daughters and poured forth to them without restraint that
flood affection that ardent spirit love by which she
was distinguished and elevated above every creature that
lived her mind was clear her intellectual powers were
complete and entire the enthusiasm with which she
now expressed herself was not that inconsiderate nature
which should tend to make them feel with greater acuteness
the loss they were about to sustain it was bright
unclouded and serene it was the eloquence as a disembodied
spirit freed from the perturbation and alloy 
human passions she reminded them that they were sisters
and exhorted each to fulfil the duties a sister and
a mother to the other two if wise and good they would
be happy in each other and their little association would bea
school preparing them for the more genuine and venerable
duties for which nature had destined them her views
 all human things were altered by her present situation on
the brink the grave our reserves and misunderstandings
had wrung her heart but she forgave me things
which had lately appeared the highest magnitude and
moment faded in the distance and mingled with the vulgar
crowd human concerns which was now retiring from
her view she must again return she said to life before she
could again feel the passions and the interests this petty
scene for the sake her daughters she had lately desired
to live she was now reconciled and content to die
she had formed the chain and link connection between
me and my girls perhaps it was better that we should
burst our fetters and be free on the fourth day after
our arrival at barcelona marguerite expired
there is nothing in the vast variety objects which
this wretched world presents to our view so dreadful and
distressing as the sight one we have loved but who isnow
no more i saw these eyes beheld the lifeless corse
u 
 travels st leon
 marguerite great god heaven what is man 
and what are we made within that petty frame resided
for years all that we worship for there resided all
that we know and can conceive excellence that heart
is now still within the whole extent that frame there
exists no thought no feeling no virtue it remains no
longer but to mock my sense and scoff at my sorrow to
rend my bosom with a woe complicated matchless and
inexpressible the cheek is pale and livid the eyes are
sunk and circled with blackness corruption and ruin
have already seized their prey and turned it into horror
draw for heaven's sake draw the pall over those lifeless
features bury bury them deep in the bowels the
earth let not my imagination follow them into the
chambers the grave and dwell amidst pestilential damps
and all the series destruction let me recollect all that
marguerite was as she lived her numerous accomplishments
her unparalleled virtues ay in all the magnitude
and wealth their detail for that is a divine and
celestial madness but let me not recollect her as i saw heron
the bier lest i become raving and blaspheme i
i have no power to talk the situation in which i was
now placed and the reader must therefore explain it for
himself if he can i never loved but once i never
loved but marguerite all other affection is stillness and
ice compared with this this is the great crisis my
history the gap between life and death the gulf that cut
me oft for ever from every thing that deserves the name 
human such was the legacy the stranger my son an
exile myself publicly arraigned as a murderer the unmerited
and tragical death hector the premature and
selfderiving loss the better half my soul who
would have believed that this envied gift would in less
than two years have thus dreadfully changed the face 
my affairs and destroyed every thing that composed the
happiness my life 
after some delay in this wretched and illomened town 
barcelona such it has ever since appeared to my thoughts
we proceeded to madrid the reader will give me credit
when i tell him that however eager i had lately felt to
travels st leon 
exhibit my magnificence and my wealth i had no such
eagerness now i speak no more the character marguerite
j i attempt not to compose her panegyric the
story her life is the best record her virtues her defects
if defects she had drew their pedigree from rectitude
 sentiment and perception from the most generous sensibility
from a heart pervaded and leavened with tenderness
a simple stone in the western aisle the great
church at barcelona records her personal and her family
name with this single addition the preserver her
family in poverty and ruin the victim her disconsolate
and repentant husband's unhallowed
wealth
but dismissing for ever and henceforth consigning to
inviolate silence her excellencies could i avoid feeling
that i could never again form a similar or indeed any
real union so long as i existed being now indeed more
than forty years age having spent near twenty that
forty in a most enviable wedlock and being blessed with a
sufficiently numerous offspring it may be thought perhaps
i might be contented but without discussing the propriety
 such a maxim as it relates to the species in
general it must be recollected in my case that my youth
was to be recommenced by a perpetual series renewals
i never gave credit to that axiom a sickly sensibility
that it is a sacrilege in him who has been engaged in one
cordial and happy union ever to turn his thoughts to
another much more reasonable than this is the indian
doctrine that the survivor ought to leap into the flames
and perish upon the funeral pyre the deceased while
we live it is one our most imperious duties to seek
our happiness he that dedicates his days to an endless
sorrow is the worst and most degraded suicides it is
an important question in the economy human life up to
what age we should allow ourselves to contract engagements
to a wife and a probable offspring but separately
from this consideration i should hold that in many cases
he who entered into a second marriage by that action
yielded a pure and honourable homage to the manes the
first but from genuine marriage i was henceforth for
u 
travels st leon
ever debarred an immortal can form no true and real
attachment to the insect an hour
mourning a depressing and speechless regret was yet
the inmate our house grief does not commonly lay a
strong and invincible hold us in the morning our
days and though the temper julia was perhaps at her
age the most tender and susceptible i ever knew even she
who was now in her seventeenth year reaped the benefit
 that elasticity which in early life is the portion 
humanity nothing material occurred to us in the first
three months our residence in madrid it was impossible
for any one to be surrounded with a more lovely
and blooming family than i was
yet from happiness i was immeasurably distant exclusively
 my recent and in every sense irreparable loss
my mind was full dark and gloomy forebodings i
feared not for myself but i had an unconquerable alarm
and apprehension for my children my youngest was but
ten years age the eldest was not seventeen sweet
tender blossoms that the cruelty and hardness mankind
might so easily blight and that required a concurrence 
favourable circumstances to ripen into all they were capable
 becoming when i recollected what had happened in
the course the last two years i could not flatter myself
that our misfortunes were at an or that i had not to
speak moderately many fierce trials yet to encounter i
seemed like the farfamed tree java to be destined to
shelter only to destroy and to prove a deadly poison to
whatever sought its refuge under my protecting branches
in this melancholy frame mind the last words my
adored marguerite passed and repassed ten thousand times
through my recollection she had formed the chain and
link connection between me and my girls perhaps it
was better that we should burst our fetters and be free
whatever she had said was sacred to the present temper
 my imagination her last behest i would have died to
execute the idea contained in the sentence i have just
repeated was ambiguous and obscure rather hinted than
expressed but was it worthy the less attention because
its author with her usual gentleness and sweetness
travels st leon 
had modestly suggested an advice instead which she was
well entitled to have done prescribing a will i determined
to part with my children that i might no longer
be to them a source corroding misery and affliction i
believed that the cloud that now oppressed me was transitory
i seemed pursued for the present by a malignant
genius but a man endowed as i was with unbounded
wealth and immortal vigour cannot easily be reduced to
despair when the tide my prosperity should unfold
its rich and ample current i might easily communicate 
its bounty to my daughters if i parted with them now
i did not lose them as i had perhaps lost their brother forever
i could turn to a particular point and say there
lies my soul i could cast my eye upon a projection
 the globe and put my finger upon their residence
wherever i wandered whether i were plunged in a dungeon
or mounted a throne my heart like the mariner's
needle would tremble towards that point as its cynosure
i had still something to love something to pant for something
to dream about and be happy
having ruminated insatiably upon the last expressions
 marguerite having formed my commentary and fixed
my predilection i recollected a person then a young
woman upon my paternal estate for whom my wife had
conceived a remarkable friendship she was the daughter
 a peasant her birth had been low and her education
confined but she had taste she had discretion she had
integrity i think i may add she had genius as marguerite
had discovered her merits and distinguished her
from her equals she had been great use to this extraordinary
rustic in unfolding her mind and guiding her
propensities this was not so much a matter deliberate
and meditated purpose in la dame du seigneur it rose
out the circumstances their situation they were
almost an age and marguerite frequently invited her
to be the associate her studies and amusements mariana
that was her name did not perhaps resemble my wife
considerably in her features but her stature was the same
her complexion and the colour her hair the similarity
in carriage and gesture mariana having never had an
 travels st leon
opportunity contemplating the accomplishments she
admired in any one but madame de st leon was still
more striking there were points indeed in which no
human creature could compare with marguerite the expressive
and flexible tone her voice and those cadences
which sprung from and communicated to every susceptible
hearer the divinest sensibility one the unhappy consequences
 our exile from the bordelois was the misfortunes
 mariana her father had fallen to decay to
relieve his distress she had contracted a marriage not 
sentiment and predilection but with a man who had promised
her that her father should never come to want this
marriage had been unhappy the husband was a prodigal
and a profligate a period seven years however delivered
her from her egyptian bondage she had but
lately become a widow and the prudence and integrity 
her conduct had rendered this alliance which to many
women would have proved a rock destruction an additional
source honour and respect mariana at the
death her husband had no children she had buried her
father she was consequently entirely alone
it was this woman i fixed upon as the protector my
daughters i was better pleased with the meanness her
extraction than i should have been with one the highborn
descendants the houses st leon or damville
had it been my fortune to have had in the female line any
near relations on either side my daughters were no longer
children they were singularly prudent considerate and
unimpeachable in their conduct and propensities they
wanted a protector in the eye the world it was desirable
for them that they should have an adviser but i should
have been grieved and mortified to give them a dictator
i wrote to mariana chabot communicating my project
and requesting her to give us the meeting at st vizier on
the frontiers france she was delighted with the office
i tendered to her acceptance and readily consented to everything
i required i conducted my daughters to the place
 rendezvous without imparting to them the design by
which i was actuated i believed that they would their
own motion conceive a partiality for the friend their
travels st leon 
mother i was not deceived in my prognostic the meeting
was an interesting one the eyes mariana overflowed
at meeting after so long an interval the husband and progeny
 the dearest and most revered friend she had ever
known the mourning we wore reminded her how lately
her incomparable patroness had been committed to the
grave my girls were struck with the resemblance 
mariana to their mother accident had prevented us from
cultivating almost any intimate connections out our own
family from the period our exile my girls had therefore
never met with a person who approached in any degree so
near their mother in accomplishments in skill in turn 
thinking and opinion mariana came up to my warmest
hopes as a protector and companion for my children her
unhappy marriage by concentrating her thoughts and expectations
in herself had perhaps rendered her more exemplary
in carriage and more elevated in sentiment than she
would ever have been without it
at st vizier i passed myself for monsieur palmer the
guardian the orphan heiresses st leon it fortunately
happened that my paternal estate was at this time
upon sale i determined to become the purchaser and to
settle my girls in the scene their nativity i procured
an agent and despatched him with an ample commission
for that purpose having adjusted this point i resolved to
make a tour with my daughters through languedoc dauphine
and the provinces usually known by the denomination
 the south france i wished to familiarise them to
the society madame chabot and to assist them in discerning
her merits under a variety points view i
asked them whether they would not be delighted to obtain
her as a companion who might assist and conduct them in
such points as only a woman understanding and experience
is competent to they every one them listened
to the idea with pleasure
at length i received the information that the purchase 
st leon was completed and i proceeded to the critical disclosure
that my daughters were on the point being
separated from their father they listened to the communication
with astonishment and terror they had entered
 travels op st leon
successively into the feelings their deceased mother and
i am well persuaded felt a less ardent attachment to my
person than they had done at the cottage the lake 
constance but culpable and criminal as i had been i
was not destitute every virtue and they could not extinguish
in themselves the respect they had so long entertained
for me habit has a resistless empire over the
human mind and when we reflect with how much reluctance
we consent to the removal a tree or a hedge to
the sight which we have been accustomed it will not be
wondered at that my daughters could not calmly think so
complete a separation from their father the impression
 their mother's death was yet green and to lose me was
to become orphans a second time but i had fully meditated
my plan and was peremptory that i might
withhold from them no advantage it was in my power to
confer i gave them bernardin for their superintending
bailiff and steward their property our parting was not
less painful and melancholy than its occasion was extraordinary
and its mode uncommon it took place at the
town montauban
i saw my dear children set forward on their journey and
i knew not that i should ever behold them more i was
determined never again to see them to their injury and i
could not take to myself the consolation on such a day
in such a month or even after such a lapse years i will
again have the joy to embrace them in a little while
they were out sight and i was alone the reader will
perhaps agree with me that no man had more exquisitely
enjoyed the dearest ties society than i had and that
perhaps few men were ever better formed to enjoy them
this complete and dreadful separation this stroke that
seemed to cut me off abruptly from every thing most
valuable that the earth contains was not the result any
 the ordinary necessities human life still less was it
the dictate alienation or indifference no it was the
pure effect love a love so strong complete and uncontrollable
as inflexibly to refuse every thing that could be
injurious to its objects i own i could not thus have
parted with marguerite her idea was mingled with the
travels st leon 
vital springs my existence and scarcely any power less
resistless than death could have made me consent to pass
an entire day without her society but then it is to be
considered that my daughters were in the morning life 
their hopes were untarnished their prospects not obscured
by a single cloud and that the crime would probably have
been greater obstinately to have made them the partners 
my misfortunes and disgrace there are persons who will
regard this passage in my history as culpable and the testimony
 a cold and unsusceptible heart i contemplate
it even at this distance time as the noblest and most
virtuous effort my life and a thousand circumstances
have occurred since to induce me to congratulate myself
that i had the courage to achieve my purpose
chapter xxix
nineteen years had now elapsed from the day that had
witnessed my union with marguerite de damville in all
that time had never been alone alone in a certain sense
indeed i had stood at paris in the period that had led to
my exile and at soleure in that which immediately succeeded
it in each case i was solitary and my solitude
was unhappy but my unhappiness was then in a certain
sense spontaneous my solitude was a luxury in which i
felt myself impelled to indulge he that has experienced
both will readily acknowledge the extreme difference between
the misery we embrace and the misery from which
we shrink with abhorrence and loathing i relinquished
in the former instances my dearest connections my proper
post and situation but i felt that i could return to the
one and resume the other at pleasure i repeat it therefore
then i had not been alone and now i was alone the
same motive which in this instance made me cut myself off
from my daughters that i might not be the cause their
misery forbad me to be the parent a future offspring
upon whom i might entail similar misfortune tell me
 travels st leon
then was i not alone i recollected the words the
stranger wrung from him by the excess his misery at the
summerhouse the lake alone alone friendless
friendless i began to penetrate the enigma his
history
i fixed my daughters with an ample revenue in the
chateau st leon i repurchased for them all my
paternal property i waited some time at montauban to
hear the event my project and their final settlement
i learned with pleasure that they found their situation
peaceful easy and reputable i enjoined them that they
should speak and think me as dead i led them to suppose
when i left montauban that i should set out upon
an extensive tour that i should traverse the indus and the
ganges and penetrate into the furthest extremities the
east how uncommon how pitiable a fate i became
prematurely dead to my country and my race because i
was destined never to die the first sensation i derived
from their prosperity as i have already said was pleasure 
my second was that which the devil might have felt when
he entered paradise for the seduction our first parents
i contemplated with some degree malignant envy a happiness
 which it was little probable i should ever partake
let me not be censured for this let any man put himself
in my situation and say whether the pleasure he feels at
contemplating the separated happiness those he loves be
not a mingled sensation with heavy heart i sought again
the road madrid
though my spirits underwent an extreme depression i
determined not to desert myself or the advantages i had
purchased at so inestimable a price i exerted myself to
shake off my lethargy and rouse the faculties my soul
i refused to give way to omens evil portent and resolved
to see what might yet be made my endowments there
is no misfortune that has not in it some slight mixture 
good my being now alone and detached from every relative
tie left me at liberty to pursue my projects with a
bolder enterprise the mistake which i accused myself
in the former instance was the entering too precipitately
into the exercise the gifts the stranger before i had
travels op st leon 
properly measured my strength and investigated the use
and application my tools i had suffered sufficiently
from the past uncertainty and irresoluteness my march
i determined as far as human precaution could secure its
ends to encounter no more misfortunes to subject myself to
no further miscarriages but to take care that henceforth the
tide my pursuits should move smoothly onward i dedicated
the six months immediately succeeding my separation
from my daughters to the joint contemplation morals
and natural philosophy i was resolved to ascertain the
simplest mode manufacturing wealth the wisest methods
for lulling the suspicions and controlling the passions 
mankind and the true science the use riches alas 
i had in the sequel frequent occasions to confess that
though i had fortuitously entered into possession the
leading secrets natural magic i was a mere tyro in the
science man at least in the degree in which the exercise
 these secrets required the possession it
nothing material occurred to interrupt the occupations 
the winter my apathy intellectual activity palsy 
the heart went evenly forward i made no acquaintance
 i was a mere spectator the busy scenes that passed
around me i was resolved not to entangle myself with
rashly formed connections and it will commonly be found
that he whose contemplations are principally employed upon
some secret and guarded hoard reflection has little propensity
to communicate upon idle and indifferent matters
a slight incident indeed disturbed me for a few days
during this interval but it passed away and for the present
i thought it no more during the festival christmas
it happened that i felt an inclination to be the spectator
 a celebrated bullfight that was exhibited before the emperor
and his court for the most part i was studious 
privacy i therefore felt the less scruple in indulging this
unusual caprice at the commencement the spectacle
i was attentive only to the exhibition i was delighted
with the form and beauty the animals with the freedom
and grandeur their motion with the terrible energy 
their assault and repulse it was not long however before
my eye was transiently caught by an individual who sat in
 travels op st leona
gallery at no great distance and who seemed to view me
attentively his figure bespoke some degree refinement
but his eye was fiery malicious and savage presently
however i turned again towards the area and thought 
him no more some time after by mere accident i looked
towards the same gallery and observed this man still in an
attitude to examine me it seemed as if he had not removed
his eyes from me during the whole interval this
was repeated three or four times without knowing why
i became anxious and uneasy i had a confused feeling
that i had seen the man before but whether in france
switzerland or italy i could not tell i experienced that
sort disagreeable sensation from looking at his face which
arises in the mind from an association the object present
with some mischief or suffering that was contemporary
with its being perceived in a preceding instance i am now
persuaded that this man was one the multitude to whom
i had addressed myself from the bench on the hill a short
time before my flight from pisa and that he was among
the most eager to interrupt and molest me but he was
apparently a spaniard by birth and i could not at this
time developed the mystery that hung about his features
finding that i could neither rid myself his curious and
watchful observation nor the disturbance it gave me i
withdrew from the gallery where i had hitherto been sitting
and removed to another gallery on the opposite side the
area about half an hour after looking accidentally round
i saw this very man at my elbow i then accosted him
with the enquiry do you know me sir to which he
immediately returned with a pure castilian accent no
senor he then began to be more reserved in his attention
to me without however entirely withdrawing it
as soon as the entertainment was over i went away and
saw no more my spaniard i began to tax myself with
pusillanimity in suffering so insignificant an incident to
disturb me a few days after however i suddenly lighted
upon him in the street he was talking to three or four
 his countrymen and in the progress his discourse
frequently pointed to me i could now perceive something
particularly hostile and ferocious in his countenance the
travels st leon 
first impulse i felt was that i would no longer suffer the
unquietness and anxiety the sight him produced in me
but would go up to him and force him to an explanation
i believed however that in the temper he indicated this
could not be done without involving myself in a quarrel
and i thought it wiser to endeavour to conquer in silence
an unreasonable sensation i therefore passed on he immediately
broke from his company and attempted to follow
me this i determined not to endure i laid my hand
on my sword with a peremptory look and waved to him to
desist his countenance then assumed an air diabolical
malignity he shook his head furiously and turned down
another street a strange sort animosity this between
two persons utter strangers to each other and which had
as yet not deigned to express itself by a word but such
is the world we hate we know not why we are ready
to cut each other's throats because we do not like the turn
 a feature or the adjustment a swordknot prejudice
party difference countries difference religions and a
thousand wild chimeras fanaticism or superstition are
continually arming us against a man whose virtues and
qualities we are ignorant and into whose benevolent or evil
intentions we disdain to enquire
i saw this spaniard but once more it was as i was on
the point entering the house a part which i occupied
i was particularly mortified at this circumstance it was
plain the man entertained for whatever reason a determined
animosity against me and i was grieved to furnish
him with that advantage for injuring me which consisted
in being acquainted with the place my residence i
would have turned away and gone down the street but i
had too fully marked my design entering the house
before i reconnoitered my enemy the displeasure i felt
was so unaccountably great that it was with difficulty my
courage got the better it and i determined not to change
the place my abode in a short time however as i have
already said i thought this incident no more that it
should have disturbed and unhinged me in the degree that
it had done even for a moment was a thing i could not
account for had the calamities in which the legacy 
x
 travels op st leon
the stranger involved me converted me in so short a time
from a knight and a soldier into a character that morbid
timidity as to tremble at every shadow or is there in
some human countenances a fascination a sort mysterious
sympathy and presentiment that makes us cower and quail
whenever we meet their eyebeams 
several weeks now passed away and i had nearly forgotten
all the circumstances this seemingly foolish story
when in a little excursion i chanced to make from madrid
to a place about twelve miles distant i was overtaken upon
the road by a cavalier respectable appearance who presently
took occasion to enter into conversation with me he
explained to me several the objects that presented themselves
on either side told the names the different nobility
and grandees who occupied the villas we saw and sometimes
entered into the particulars their history i at first gave
little encouragement to this communicative traveller but
there was something so polite in his manner and intelligent
in his discourse that i could not prevail upon myself to
treat him with rudeness or disrespect after having talked
for some time upon indifferent topics he led to the general
state literature in europe few subjects could appear
less dangerous than this as there were few upon which i
felt myself better qualified to converse by degrees i threw
off some my original reserve and i found my companion
well informed and ingenious lively in his manner and
pertinent in his remarks
by this time the unknown having discovered that i had
only come from madrid for a day's relaxation invited himself
to dine with me at my inn i departed from my
established system conduct on this occasion and admitted
his overture after dinner he gave me some account 
himself and his family and seemed to expect from me a
similar explicitness i was less pleased with him in this
particular than i had been with his frank and undesigning
conversation on the road strictly speaking however the
expectation implied was only a breach politeness i had
no reason to suppose that he foresaw it to be particularly
offensive to me observing my backwardness he immediately
changed the subject presently he remarked that
travels st leon 
by my physiognomy and accent he perceived i was a
frenchman and asked me if i had known cornelius
agrippa who died about twelve years before at grenoble i
answered in the negative the unknown then entered
into a warm eulogium the talents agrippa inveighed
against the illiberal treatment he had experienced in consequence
 his supposed proficiency in magic and spoke
with great asperity the priests and inquisitors who had
been his persecutors i became attentive watchful and
suspicious he went on to expatiate upon the praises 
the art magic which nothing he said but the jealousy 
churchmen had brought into disrepute affirmed that it
had been treated with respect and counted illustrious by
the ancients in the instance pythagoras apologies
thanes and others and expressed a great desire to become
a student the art himself this kind discourse made
me repent that i had been drawn in so far as to sit down
with this unknown and admit him as my companion 
the day during the whole time he was the principal
speaker sometimes he paused with a seeming desire to
hear my sentiments but i had now formed my resolution
and gave him no encouragement presently after i called
for my horse i should have observed that his servant
who followed him engaged in conversation with mine at
the same time that the dialogue began between their masters
seeing me about to depart the unknown motioned as if to
accompany me upon this i became serious
cc senor caballero said i i have now had the pleasure
 your company to dinner i am going home and
have the honour to bid you farewell it is neither my disposition
nor the habit the grave and dignified nation
among whom i at present reside to form permanent acquaintances
upon casual rencounters you will not therefore
think i violate the hospitality for which i am indebted
to them if i intimate to you my desire to return alone
all this i said with the grave and formal tone becoming
a spaniard and the unknown had nothing to reply it was
evident however that my dryness chagrined him and he
even muttered words resentment between his teeth i
could observe now a degree hostility and fury in his
x 
 travels op st leon
countenance which remarkably contrasted with the pliancy
and obligingness his preceding demeanour i took no
notice however these circumstances and rode away i
have since had sufficient reasons to convince me that these
two persons whose story but for that explanation may appear
to the reader exceedingly frivolous were the one an
informer and the other a spy the holy inquisition the
man who had seen me at pisa had his imagination terrified
and his superstition set in arms by all that he had heard 
me in that place and thought he could not perform a more
meritorious work than by giving intelligence to the fathers
what sort person had taken refuge in the metropolis
 this most catholic kingdom it was with this view he
had watched me and at length by an accident he deemed
peculiarly fortunate lodged me in my proper habitation
having given in his denunciation my travelling companion
was next fastened on me by the contrivance and zeal the
fathers inquisitors he was a familiar the holy office
and it is well known that persons the fairest prospects
and most polite education in spain are led by their religious
impressions to place a pride in performing menial and even
perfidious offices in the service the inquisition the
kind dishonour i put upon him in parting though a
nature he could not openly resent i fear conspired with his
zeal for god's and the church's honour to induce him to
relate a story concerning me more modelled by the bitterness
 his personal feelings than distinguished by a regard
to truth
such was the snare woven and drawing close round me
on all sides for my destruction i was made uneasy by
the rencounter the traveller but by no means aware 
the whole extent the mischief that impended over me
when i came to retrace point by point the discourse he
had held i could not conceive that the turn it had taken
originated in accident i perceived with no little grief 
heart and concern that i was known it was however
necessary that i should reflect maturely upon the conduct
to be pursued by me i ought not gratuitously to expose
myself to danger but then on the other hand it is a
point general wisdom and was particularly incumbent in
travels st leon q
my extraordinary circumstances not to suffer vigilance to
degenerate into restless anxiety it would be easy for me
if i were not strictly on my guard continually to find food
for suspicion and to surround myself with imaginary plots
and dangers this was a vice that i was willing enough
to pity in others but there was no character that i more
cordially disdained for myself there was none more
pointedly in opposition to that gallant generous confiding
spirit which had distinguished those military heroes my
native soil who had been the exclusive object my earliest
admiration and whom in my present dejected and deserted
situation i still desired to resemble when i came
to reflect i easily perceived that this vice was particularly
allied to a life solitude and that he who is cut off from
the genuine and happy connections husband father and
friend is all men most liable in their absence to conjure
up for himself the unnatural intercourse and reciprocations
 hostility it was thus that i artificially reconciled myself
to my situation and obstinately closed my eyes upon
those equivocal demonstrations danger which from time
to time were presented to my view
chapter xxx
such was the state my mind when it happened one
gloomy evening in the latter march that my valet
announced to me three gentlemen who were come to visit
me it was strange i had no visitors i indulged no
relaxation but that the street and public places do
you know who they are said i i accidentally looked
up and saw paleness and terror written in his countenance
he had not however time to reply before they burst into
the room they were alguazils the inquisition they
told me their errand was to conduct me to the holy office
i submitted and accompanied them it was already
dark they put me into a litter with the curtains drawn
and then arranged themselves in silence one on each side
x 
 travels st leon
while one brought up the rear i was taken by surprise 
nothing could be further from my expectation than such an
event as we passed along i ruminated with myself on
the line conduct it was incumbent on me to pursue to
make an immediate experiment the fidelity my guides
was a doubtful attempt if for want time and the opportunity
 a tranquil hearing i miscarried with them the
trial would be converted into evidence against me if i
succeeded i had then to escape out spain in the centre
 which i now was from the hostility a tribunal which
was said to surpass all the tribunals on the face the earth
in activity and vigilance i knew nothing that the
fathers the inquisition could have against me i had
lived in the most entire seclusion and i could defy
any one to report a single action mine since i had entered
spain to my prejudice i had been wholly occupied
with melancholy reflections on the past and solitary inventions
and devices which i purposed to bring forward for the
future i determined not to live for ever the slave fear
i believed that the best method for defeating a danger in
many cases was undauntedly to encounter it and i did
not imagine that i could have a more favourable opportunity
for that purpose than the present i had heard much
indeed the terrors the inquisition but a generous and
liberal spirit lends no very attentive ear to horrors the trite
and vulgar rumour which only has reached him i disdained
to be blown down with a breath i believed that
the inquisition itself would not venture to proceed criminally
against a man against whom nothing criminal had
been alleged in every event i believed it would never be
too late to have recourse to my peculiar prerogatives
upon entering the prison the inquisition i was first
conducted to a solitary cell it is not my intention to treat
 those particulars the holy office which are already
to be found in innumerable publications i have no pleasure
in reviving the images this sojourn horrors i
know it is unreasonable to despise a man for the miseries
and wretchedness he has endured but i know that such is
the human heart and i will not expose myself to be scoffed
at and trampled upon for my misfortunes i found myself
travels op st leon 
under the necessity while in the inquisition submitting
to that most profligate all impositions an oath secrecy
as to what had seen and what i had suffered and whatever
may be the strict morality such an obligation i will
not ambitiously thrust myself forward in violation it i
will restrict the story i have to relate to the peculiarities
that characterised my case and enter as little as possible
into the general policy this frontier intrenchment 
the christian faith
when i was brought up to be interrogated i was assailed
with innumerable questions the obvious purport 
which was as much as possible to extort from me evidence
 every kind that might be injurious to my cause the
object the inquisition is to defend our holy mother the
church from whatever might defile her sanctity and whiteness
every thing that calls into question the truth her
doctrines that pollutes and turns from their original purpose
any her ordinances or that implies commerce and league
with the invisible enemy saints it is its peculiar province
to investigate the fathers are therefore particularly cautious
that they may not by confining their questions too
much to a single object preclude themselves from the chance
 discovering danger under all the forms it may assume
it is presumed that he who is a corrupt member the
church christ in one point is unsound and unfaithful in
others
the inquisitor who examined me first demanded
whether i were informed for what cause i was brought
before that tribunal whether i did not find myself able
to conjecture the nature my offence whether i did not
know the sort crimes for which men were detained in
that prison he then desired me to recollect myself and
consider whether i were not conscious offence against
the holy catholic church whether i had never asserted
or maintained any doctrine contrary to what mother
church asserts and maintains whether i had never to
my knowledge defiled any the ordinances god or
applied things sacred to unholy and profane purposes
whether i had never invocation the devil whether i
had never held any commerce or entered into any league
x 
 travels op st leon
with the enemy saints whether i had never performed
or sought to perform preternatural and miraculous acts by
unholy means whether i had never vexed or sought to
vex those against whom i had enmity by secret and forbidden
arts whether i had never resided in countries the
inhabitants which were heretics and whether i had never
listened to their discourses and arguments whether when
i inhabited such countries i had never assisted at the celebration
 divine ordinances performed by heretics or in a
form which holy church disapproves or condemns 
finding that he could gain nothing upon me by these
general interrogatories the inquisitor next descended to
particulars he enquired concerning the incidents my
pisan story which having first assured myself from the
train his questions that some representation that unfortunate
affair had reached his ear i willingly related to
the same extent that i had previously done to the marchese
filosanto
he then proceeded to a great number questions the
source which is to be traced to the commonly received
notions respecting sorcerers and necromancers they were
so artfully contrived and so large in their scope that it was
not easy to guess whether they related to any particular accusation
alleged against me or were formed entirely on
general principles yet some them were so minute so
connected and arranged so perfectly in series that i could
not but believe they were an echo the calumnies invented
against me at pisa which however as i had never collected
any regular and detailed account i could not accurately
trace the influence on the present occasion
the inquisitor demanded me whether i had never
seen or held conversation with any supernatural being or
the spirit a man departed whether i had never practised
diabolical arts to raise the dead whether i had
never had a familiar in the form some insect domestic
animal or reptile he was particularly subtle and copious
in his questions respecting the history my unfortunate
dog endeavouring to surprise me in some slip or contradiction
in what i affirmed on the subject he asked whether
i had never assumed a form different from my real one
either a different age and appearance or a different species
travels st leon
 animal whether i had never hy the agency 
my demon inflicted sickness convulsionfits or death 
whether i had never caused the mortality cattle
whether i had not the power being in two places at
once whether i had never been seen riding through the
air whether i had never been wounded in my absence
by a blow aimed at my astral spirit or apparition whether
i had never possessed books conjuration or the art magic 
whether it had never happened to me that an indifferent
person indiscreetly perusing a spell or incantation in my
possession had been maimed or killed by the spirits he had
unfeignedly evoked 
a further object particularly pursued in my interrogatory
was the detection my property and the questions constructed
for this purpose were uncommonly artful and
multiplied the inquisitor told me that the holy office
was by the nature its institution the guardian and administrator
 every person that fell under its animadversion
shut up he said as i must be during the pendency
 my cause and separated from the rest mankind i
was wholly incapable superintending my worldly affairs
which unless they were properly looked into might in the
interval be materially injured i ought therefore implicitly
and without reserve to refer myself in this point to the
care the fathers if my innocence were established ashe
hoped and earnestly prayed to the mother god and
the saints jesus might ultimately happen i should find
the holy office a faithful and qualified steward if on the
contrary i should be proved a heretic and an alien to the
most high i ought then to rejoice in the beneficent interference
 the fathers who by dedicating my wealth to
consecrated purposes would mitigate in the eye the just
judge heaven and earth the duration or fierceness my
punishments in a future world the inquisitor had apparently
heard various reports my riches and was inexpressibly
chagrined that he should be found so unskilful
a member his profession as not to be able to extort from
me a full confession on that head after having employed
every artifice menace and terror after having endeavoured
to soothe and cajole me by blandishments and persuasion
and finding all his expedients fruitless he poured
 travels st leon
upon me the full storm his indignation he said it
was apparent that i was dealing disingenuously and fraudulently
with the delegated guardians religion j it was
impossible that the expenditure i was well known more or
less to have incurred could be supported without considerable
funds and my evident duplicity and concealment in
this point must be regarded as a full confirmation every
crime my accusers had alleged against me
in the course my examinations the inquisitor who
questioned me gave himself the trouble entering into a
full vindication the tribunal which he was a member
he said that every thing that was valuable to mankind
not only in a future state but also in the present depended
upon preserving in full vigour and strength the sacred institutions
 the christian faith and that those who were
endowed with powers sufficient for that purpose would be
in the highest degree inexcusable in the sight god if
they did not vigilantly and inflexibly maintain the exertion
 those powers it was an egregious mistake selfwilled
and opinionated men to suppose that the maintenance 
our holy religion was sufficiently provided for by the clearness
 its evidence it was no less dangerous to pretend
that the stability and duration the church christ
might be confided to the providence god providence
acts by human means and it was presumptuous for those
who neglected the means to trust that they should nevertheless
see the adequately secured why had providence
thought proper to generate an alliance between church
and state and to place the powers and authority human
society in the hands the adherents the christian faith 
magistrates and governments were thus made the vicars 
heaven and great would be their condemnation if they
neglected the trust reposed in them the great adversary
 mankind was incessantly watchful for the destruction 
souls and while he spread abroad his delusions it was
folly to imagine that evidence alone was powerful enough
to counteract them what judges were the great mass 
mankind the integrity and validity evidence the jest
 the scorner was ever at hand to turn into ridicule the most
sacred mysteries the opposers our holy faith were in
travels st leon 
indefatigable in their industry and as anxious in their exertions
to deprive their fellowmen every comfort and hope
as if infidelity which was the curse the human species
were the greatest blessing that could be conferred on
them the devil was a hard taskmaster and granted no
vacation night or day to those who enlisted themselves in
the support his cause it might answer well enough
the purpose the vainglorious theorist to suppose that
man was a rational animal but they who had regarded
human society with an observing eye knew that it was
otherwise delusion would ever be too hard for evidence
and the grossest falsehoods prove victorious over the most
sacred truths if what was illiberally and maliciously styled
persecution were not brought in aid the cause religion
the passions mankind were on the side falsehood
man unrestrained by law was a wild ferocious and most
pernicious beast and were it not for the wholesome curb
 authority would speedily throw off all ties and limitations
human and divine nothing could more clearly
prove that the heretical followers luther and calvin
who had lately sprung up for the plague mankind
whatever they might pretend were in reality the determined
enemies all revelation than their continual demand
that the cause should be tried by discussion and
that every man should be defended in the exercise his
private judgment they could not but know every
man not totally robbed all power discernment must
know that if this demand were once granted it would
prove a blow at the root every sentiment religion
the inquisition therefore was the most salutary institution
that had ever been devised and the future welfare 
mankind wholly depended upon the maintenance its
powers and its maxims by a moderate and judicious
exhibition terror it superseded the necessity innumerable
punishments the inquisition was not capricious
and uncertain in its policy it acted under the direction 
immutable laws it held a tender but a firm rein upon the
extravagances and madness mankind nothing was
more notorious than that a regular and systematical proceeding
was both more effectual and more generous than
 travels op st leon
one that was fickle he defied the whole history the
world to produce an example so merciful a tribunal
the great its policy was the reclaiming sinners
and the multiplication penitents who after a gentle
and salutary discipline were again by holy church received
into her bosom and even when they delivered the finally
impenitent to the flames it was to the flames a purifying
fire which by destroying the flesh redeemed or diminished
the punishments a future world he knew that an outcry
had been artfully raised against the proceedings the
holy office but it was easy to see that its enemies under
the pretence compassion for its victims concealed an
inveterate animosity against property religion and civil
society the anabaptists had thrown off the mask and
discovered their true designs and the rest were only more
plausible and specious in proportion as they were more
timid the present was the most important crisis that
ever occurred in the history the world there was a
spirit at work that aimed at dissolving all the bonds 
civil society and converting mankind into beasts and
savages who had not heard the levellers millenarians
and fifthmonarchymen who under the specious guise 
disinterestedness and an universal love mankind had
nothing in view but the most sacrilegious and unprincipled
depredations it was true that the preachers these
doctrines were utterly contemptible both for numbers and
talent but it would be found a shortsighted policy to
overlook these desperate assailants on account the poorness
and meanness their qualifications for his own
part he did not hesitate to say that human society would
owe its preservation if it were preserved to the merciful
yet vigorous proceedings the court inquisition the
misrepresentations that were invidiously made the present
firm and vigilant system policy would be heard fora
day and then universally abandoned posterity he was
well assured would do full justice to the sagacity and
soundness the conduct this calumniated and much
injured institution
the reader will forgive me if the panegyric thus elaborately
pronounced by the inquisitor who examined me
travels op st leon 
upon the court which he was a member had not all the
weight with my mind at the moment i heard it which he
will probably ascribe to it in the calmness the closet
it is so difficult to be impartial in our own cause the
candid mind will no doubt make a large allowance for the
unhappy situation in which i now stood and the bitter and
galling thoughts that preyed upon my memory but if i
am chargeable with temporary injustice in the judgment i
then passed on the arguments the inquisitor i flatter
myself that i have been able after the interval that has
elapsed to give a true and adequate statement them
beside these reasonings on the necessity a wholesome
restraint on the privileges speaking and writing the
father in another my examinations condescended to
delineate to me the mysteries the world spirits he
reminded me that in the first grand rebellion upon record
that the fallen angels which he considered the present
defection under luther and calvin as in some measure a
counterpart a third the host heaven had been thrust
out the celestial mansions these accursed spirits had
since been permitted to pursue their machinations on
the face our earth the devil like a roaring lion
goeth about seeking whom he may devour the oracles
 the heathens the temptations job and our saviour
and the demoniac sacred writ were examples the
extensive power which heaven had thought fit to allow
him men a sceptical and feeble understanding had
been tempted to doubt whether this was consistent with
the wisdom and goodness god but though it was in
vain for us to pretend to fathom the depth the divine
mysteries there were certain reasons that were sufficiently
obvious to every ingenuous mind there were persons in
all ages the world who like the sadducees in the time
 our blessed saviour were inclined to affirm that there
was no resurrection neither angel nor spirit and god
permitted the lying wonders infernal agents the more
completely to confound the unbelief his enemies he
who witnessed the wonderful operations witchcraft or
saw the ghost a man departed could not doubt the
interference invisible agents in the concerns our
 travels st leon
nether world and if there were devils and apparitions it
would be to the last degree unreasonable to deny the existence
 god or the miracles christ these were to
be received as the grounds the divine permission 
sorcerers necromancers and witches but the rules 
the divine conduct were not to constitute the rules ours
he might permit the agency invisible malice because
he saw things upon an unlimited scale his judgments were
infallible and he could say to beelzebub himself thus
far shalt thou go and no further those to whose care
was intrusted the welfare mankind here or hereafter
were bound as far as possible to oppose themselves to the
empire satan his power was given him only for a
time and if not strictly restrained god and the powers
ordained god it would overrun every thing and plunge
all this beautiful scene creation in its original chaos
there was an endless and eternal war between god and
the devil and the governors the church were heaven's
fieldofficers and pioneers for carrying it on all the
crimes he added to which the depravity human nature
had given birth the most astonishing and the most horrible
was that diabolical commerce that human
creatures should be so far infatuated as to enter into
league with the declared enemy souls and for the possession
 a shortlived and precarious power to sign away
their spirits to eternal damnation was so extraordinary as
to have been wholly unworthy credit were it not supported
by evidence as strong and irresistible as that the
miracles jesus christ himself the persons who thus
voluntarily made themselves accursed before god deserved
to be regarded with alienation and horror by the whole
human race every man that saw them was bound by
his baptismal engagements to destroy them and whoever
administered to them the smallest portion food drink
or comfort thereby rendered himself a party to their guilt
the inquisition especially had declared against this race 
men eternal war and considered their crime as more complicated
audacious and pestilential than any other branch
 heresy having for his own part no doubt that i was
one these noxious and enormous reprobates he exhorted
travels op st leon 
me to make a voluntary confession my evil deeds and
by submitting readily to the tortures and punishments 
this world endeavour to free myself if it were yet possible
from those the world to come
these discourses the inquisitor were variously interspersed
through the three examinations to which i was
subjected a short time after i became an inhabitant the
holy house on my part i endeavoured to the best my
power to repel the imputations cast upon me to establish
my innocence and to confound the severity my oppressors
i told the inquisitor whatever might be the force 
his arguments respecting heresy and dealings with the devil
they were nothing to me i was no lutheran no anabaptist
no necromancer no underminer the faith others orally
 the prince the infernal regions i proudly and
earnestly demanded to be confronted with my accusers i
asked my examiner in his turn what sort justice that
was which pretended to proceed capitally against its prisoners
upon secret and unavowed accusations he endeavoured
to stop me he told me that i was not brought
there to arraign the methods and practices their court 
that it did not become a prisoner put upon his defence to
insult his judges that this contumacy could not be regarded
but as an aggravation my guilt and that i was bound
strictly and simply to answer the interrogatories that were
proposed to me the rebuke the inquisitor was unavailing
my spirit was wrought to too high a pitch to be thus
restrained i was too firmly resolved to give the utmost
force mind and truth to the topics my just defence
it is the practice the inquisition for the prisoner to sit
during his examination i started upon my feet
the mode your proceeding cried i is the mockery
 a trial from your fatal bar no man can go forth acquitted
how is a story to be refuted when hardly and
with difficulty you suffer your prisoner to collect the slightest
fragments it if i would detect a calumny is it not requisite
that i should be acquainted with its history and
know its authors and propagators then i may perhaps be
able to confound their forgeries to show the groundlessness
 their allegations to expose the baseness their purposes
 travels st leon
and the profligacy their characters i am informed 
nothing yet i am bid first to be my own accuser and then
to answer the accusations others it is only by following
a falsehood through all its doubling that it can be effectually
destroyed you bid me unravel a web and will not
suffer me to touch it with one my fingers the defence
 the purest innocence is often difficult sometimes impossible
against the artfulness a malicious tale or the
fortuitous concurrence unfavourable appearances but
you strip innocence those consecrated weapons by which
only it can be defended give to an accusation the particulars
with which what really happens must always be
attended give to it the circumstances place and time
lay aside the ambiguity and generalities in which you shelter
yourselves and then perhaps then only it can be victoriously
repelled you ask me a thousand various and artfully
constructed questions what sort a man do you imagine
me to be i am not a fool that i should be inveigled i
am not a boy that i should be menaced into confessions
cease your base and unprincipled arts i will furnish no
materials against myself if you know any thing against me
avow it propose it and i will answer think not to patch
up a miserable accusation out the words which inadvertence
or weariness may cause me to utter shame on
your institution may infamy overtake the system your
proceedings that religion which is supported by such
means is viler than atheism that civilisation which has
its basis in despotism is more worthless and hateful than
the state savages running wild in their woods
do you not perceive that the language i am now holding
to you is the exclusive privilege conscious innocence
the indignation i express is no artificial rage studiously
contrived to overbear accusation you have it as it flows
spontaneously to my tongue warm from the promptings 
an honest heart if i could have consulted a friend it is
probable he would have dissuaded me from my present
demeanour as impolitic if i were governed by the dictates
 an ordinary prudence i should have displayed less
ardour less resentment but i am willing to try whether
shame cannot yet be lighted up even in the cheek an
inquisitor
travels st leon
the father who examined me having in vain endeavoured
to check the current my invective changed his manner
and assumed a tone diametrically the reverse mine he
professed that he felt much compassion and interest for my
misfortune and should deem himself happy if he could bethe
instrument my deliverance the language i had
uttered was highly indecorous and such as seemed in itself
to call for a rigorous penance but he should not think
himself worthy the name a man if he did not make suitable
allowance for the bitter and extravagant sentiments
that would occasionally find their way into the mind one
in my unfortunate situation so circumstanced men would
often mistake their friends for their enemies i regarded
the inquisition as my enemy it was in reality my firm and
disinterested friend zealously watchful for my body my
my soul and my estate other courts had other maxims
 proceeding because their motives action were different
and it was but just that they should furnish their prisoners
with a defence against their frailty but the breast an
inquisitor was accessible to no sentiment but that love
a burning love god love the church love the
prisoner who might be wrongfully accused love the
penitent whom he reconciled to our common mother the
church love even the incorrigible heretic whose body he
burned for the good his soul the inquisitor did not
discover to the prisoner the evidence adduced against him 
that was between god and the inquisitor's conscience but
the suppression which was thus practised rendered him
doubly scrupulous and sceptical as to the evidence he received
 he sifted it with a severity that the prisoner would
in vain endeavour to imitate and the rules evidence in
that court were so guarded punctilious and minute as to
render any mistake in its proceedings altogether impossible
for a man to be once a prisoner the court inquisition
by a salutary prejudice which prevailed through the catholic
world rendered him for ever infamous this was another
cause the extreme wariness and caution with which that
court was accustomed to proceed they first listened to
the accuser who was obliged to give in his information on
oath they then instituted a secret enquiry against the
y
 travels st leon
party accused and till they had collected abundant ground
for their proceeding they did not venture to touch a hair 
his head they elaborately classed all the different degrees
 evidence into half proof full proof proof less than half
and proof less than full when these things were duly considered
it would appear certain that no court that had at anytime
existed on earth had ever been so tender in its proceedings
so pure in its incitements and so every way superior
to the attacks calumny and malice as the court 
inquisition
with respect to myself in particular he said they had
not apprehended me and put me upon my defence without
previously assembling a large body miscellaneous and
circumstantial evidence the evidence they had drawn
from myself was negative only but it was strong the obscurity
that hung about my person who i was and whence
i came and the obscurity that hung about my fortune a
great visible expenditure in spain or in italy and no visible
means these were not the signatures and tokens innocence
they tended strongly to confirm the accusation
under which i laboured yet so tender was the inquisition
in its proceeding and so chary its reputation that upon
these accumulated proofs and presumptions they were not
prepared to pronounce against me they would hear me
again and again they would give me time to recollect
myself and for this purpose they would order for me a
coarse and scanty fare and a solitary cell i might depend
upon it my contumacy should be overcome the fundamental
principle their proceedings was borrowed from
that humane and compassionate maxim the old roman
law de vita hominis nulla cunctatio est long and i
should accordingly find them free from all precipitation and
impatience and ready to indulge me with a residence however
long in their prisons till my case had been sifted to
the bottom
travels st leon
chapter xxxi
the indulgence thus ostentatiously proclaimed by the fatherinquisitor
was not exactly to my taste finding that all
the energy mind i could apply to my defence was vain
i determined to have recourse to a different mode proceeding
i received three admonitions as they call them
the substance which i have already recited in the course
 the first ten days my confinement and i then for
some time heard the inquisitor no more i understood
that it was frequently the practice after three admonitions
not to bring up the prisoner for further hearing
during a whole year and it appeared sufficiently probable
from the last words addressed to me by my judge
that this policy was intended to be employed in my
case without further delay therefore i resolved to recur
to the expedient in the use which my power was
unbounded and by a brilliant offer at once to subdue the
scruples and secure the fidelity the person or persons
upon whom my safe custody might be found to depend
all that was necessary was to convince the party to whom
i should propose the assisting me the reality my
powers and then to put carte blanche into his hands or
rather to ascertain at once the extent his hopes and demands
and by a spirited and peremptory conduct to yield
them all in the period which immediately previous to
my present imprisonment i had devoted to the meditation
 my future plans and the review my past i had severely
accused myself half measures and had determined to
abjure all hesitation and irresoluteness for the time to come
it is not indeed to be wondered at that possessing a power
so utterly remote from common ideas and conceptions and
which speaking from experience i do not hesitate to affirm
no mere effort imagination is adequate to represent i
should have acted below the prerogatives and demands 
my situation this mistake i would make no more i
would overwhelm opposition by the splendour my proceedings
and confound scruples by the dignity and princely
y 
 travels st leon
magnificence my appearance unshackled as i was with
connections and risking no one's happiness but my own i
proposed to compel the human species to view me from an
awful distance and to oblige every one that approached me
to feel his inferiority it would be to the last degree disgraceful
and contemptible in me being raised so far above
my peers in my privileges if i were to fall below the ordinary
standard a gallant man in the decision and firmness
 my system conduct decision and firmness were the
principles to be exercised by me now dignity and magnificence
must await their turn hereafter
it was not long before i embraced an opportunity 
speaking to the man who waited on me with my daily
allotment provisions and i designed as shortly as possible
to proceed to that species argument in which i
principally confided to engage him in my cause but he
did not suffer me to utter a sentence before with a very
expressive gesture he interrupted me i had remarked
already the silence which seemed for ever to pervade this
dismal abode but i had not ascribed importance enough to
this circumstance to suppose that it could materially interfere
with the project i had formed i now perceived the
countenance my attendant to be overspread with terror
and alarm he put his hand upon my mouth and by his
attitude seemed earnestly to insist upon my conforming to
the rules the prison i was not however to be thus
diverted from my purpose i seized his hands and began
again to pursue the discourse i had meditated this proceeding
on my part induced him to break the silence he
had hitherto preserved he told me that if i did not instantly
set him at liberty he would alarm the prison i
loosed his hands i then by every gesture i could devise
endeavoured to prevail on him to approach me to suffer me
to confer with him in the lowest whisper and assured
him that he should have no reason to repent his compliance
i might as well have addressed myself to the walls that
inclosed me he would not stay an instant he would
yield in nothing he burst from me abruptly and closing
the door my cell left me in solitude and darkness
travels st leon 
in the evening the day this attempt the keeper 
the prison entered my apartment when he appeared i
began to flatter myself that in this man i should find a
better subject for my purpose than in the poor turnkey who
had given me so unfavourable a prognostic my success
i lost no time in saying to him that i had something important
to communicate but he peremptorily commanded
me to be silent and listen to what he was about to say tome
he told me that i had already been complained
against for speech and i was now repeating my offence
he advised me to ponder well the consequences what i
was doing the orders the inquisition were rigorous
and inflexible the cells were not so substantially separated
but that a voice might be heard from one to the other
yet it had happened more than once that a husband and
wife a father and child had for years been lodged next to
each other without the smallest suspicion on either part 
the proximity their situation he was astonished at the
pertinacity my behaviour there was no government on
the face the earth he would venture to say that had subjects
more obedient more dutiful and exemplary than the
holy inquisition not a murmur was ever heard not a
discontent ever expressed all was humbleness thankfulness
and gratitude he recommended to me to conform
myself to my situation and let him hear no further complaints
 me he had no sooner finished his harangue
than he left me as abruptly as his servant had done it is
not possible to impart any adequate image the inflexibility
 his features or the stern composure his demeanour

i now saw my situation in a different point view
bribery was no use where all intercourse was denied
great god into what position was i got in the midst
 a great and populous city at this time perhaps the metropolis
 the world i heard occasionally from beyond the
limits my prison the hum busy throngs or the shouts
 a tumultuous populace yet i was myself in the deepest
solitude like the wretched mariners i have somewhere
read shipwrecked upon a desert shore i might remain

and all acquaintance with the sound my own voice a
jailor from time to time entered my apartment but to me
he was simply a moving and breathing statue his features
never moulded into the expression a meaning nor his
mouth opened for the utterance a sound from the first
i had been struck with the extreme and deathlike silence
that characterised the place my confinement but my
mind was occupied with other thoughts and i had not
adverted to the cause the phenomenon i had then felt
little inclination to the converse a jailor my natural disposition
was somewhat singular for a frenchman and inclined
to taciturnity i had resolved to make a fair and
ample trial the power a just defence where my innocence
was so complete and i was entirely disengaged
from those unfavourable appearances which had constituted
my misfortune at constance and i even rejoiced that a
silence which i regarded as casual and individual delivered
me from all fear impertinence in my attendant with
how different a temper do we contemplate an incident
which we persuade ourselves continues to operate only
because we want inclination to remove it and an incident
which is violently imposed and to which with the utmost
exertion our strength we cannot succeed to impart the
slightest shock the external object is the same its picture
in the intellectual sensorium how unlike what a profound
and inconceivable refinement in the art tyranny is this
silence the jailor might well tell me that beneath his
roofs there was neither complaint nor murmur that the
very soul its inhabitants was subdued and that they
suffered the most unheard oppressions without astonishment
or indignation this is the peculiar prerogative 
despotism it produces many symptoms the same general
appearance as those which are derived from liberty and
justice there are no remonstrances there is no impatience
or violence there is a calm a fatal and accursed
tranquillity that pervades the whole the spectator enters
and for a time misinterprets every object he sees he perceives
human bodies standing or moving around him and
it is with the utmost surprise if he has leisure and opportunity
to observe a little further that he finds at last the
travels st leon 
things he sees to be the mere shades men cold inert
glaring bodies which the heavenborn soul has long since
deserted wonderful i hesitate not to affirm is the genuine
and direct power such a situation as that in which
i was now placed upon the human imagination what
was it then to me to whom speech was not merely one 
those things misnamed indulgences misnamed luxuries
upon which the desirableness and the health human existence
depend but who had looked to it as the only and
the assured means my rescue from this scene horrors 
i intreat the reader to pardon me when i confess that the
operation the discovery i made was so overwhelming
and apparently desperate that it was some weeks i might
say months before my mind recovered its wonted bias and
activity
it was towards the close the period i have named
that a new incident concurring with that familiarity which
serves in some measure to disarm every mischief its
sting restored and reawakened my mind i had vegetated
now for some time if the metaphor can with propriety be
applied to existence in a noxious and imprisoned air by
which all vegetation would have been undermined and
which the vital principle in man is scarcely competent to
surmount and in all this period had encountered nothing
from without nor received any intimation that could in the
slightest degree interrupt the progressive destruction and
waste the soul one day at the customary hour my
being attended by my warder i was surprised to see him
bring with him a visiter to my cell the unknown was a
man with grey hairs and a silver beard though once tall
he now stooped considerably and supported himself with a
staff his dress was simple and neat and his whole appearance
prepossessing a sweet serenity was diffused over his
countenance yet there were occasionally a fire and a contemplative
grasp thought expressed in his eyes which
sufficiently proved to me that his serenity was not the result
 vacancy all this i discerned by the faint and uncertain
light a small lamp which the warder had brought with
him and placed upon my table the introduction was
performed in silence and the warder left us alone the
y 
 travels st leon
unknown beckoned me to be seated for the first emotion
 surprise at the entrance a stranger had caused me to
start on my feet and opening a folding stool he had received
from my attendant he placed himself beside me
he then addressed me in a low voice and told me that
the humanity the fathers the inquisition had given
him permission to visit me and that if i would be so
obliging in conformity to the regulations the prison as
to lower my voice to the standard his we were at liberty
to confer together he hoped the conference would be some
relief to my solitude if not lead to my complete liberation
he then unfolded to me his story he told me that he
like myself had been committed to the prisons the inquisition
upon an accusation sorcery having advanced
thus far he stopped he talked miscellaneously and digressively
 wizards and their familiars possessions and demons
 charms spells talismans and incantations even 
the elixir vita and the philosopher's stone sometimes in
the progress this discourse i could perceive him observing
me with the utmost narrowness as if he would dive into
my soul and again particularly when he caught a glance
 suspicion in my eye with infinite address changing his
attitude and tone and assuming a surprising air ingenuousness
and gaiety in a word he was a consummate
actor it was evident whether his designs were hostile or
friendly that his purpose was to make himself master 
my secret i asked him whether the accusation sorcery
which had been preferred against him were well founded
or a calumny he evaded that question and was only
influenced by it to talk more copiously and fluently on other
topics with the apparent design making me forget the
enquiry i had made he avoided anticipation lest he should
miscalculate and take wrong ground in my affair and
though superficially he seemed communicative i found that
he scarcely told me respecting himself any one thing definite
and clear he celebrated the clemency the fathers the
inquisition he said they seemed to regard themselves as
the adoptive parents those they held in their custody
and were anxious solely for the restoration souls in
their exterior they were austere and had unfortunately contravels
 st leon 
traced a forbidding manner but he had soon found upon
a closer inspection their character that the only way to
deal successfully with them was to repose in them a perfect
confidence this panegyric was not resorted to till he had
exhausted the various topics by which he had hoped himself
to extort my secret from me i asked him whether
the effect his reposing confidence had been an abjuration
 sorcery and reconciliation to the church but this question
experienced the fate every other that i addressed to
him he only told me generally that he had every reason
to be satisfied with and to speak well the treatment he
had experienced in the house the inquisition he possessed
or rather as i believed affected a character 
thoughtless garrulity and loquacity well adapted to cover
the strange deviations and abrupt transitions that marked
his discourse it was certainly singularly contrasted with
that close and penetrating air which from time to time i
remarked in him
the reader may deem it surprising and unaccountable 
but certain it is i took uncommon delight in this man's
company i pressed him earnestly to repeat his visits and
would scarcely suffer him to depart till he had promised
to come to me again the next day or the day after yet i
looked on him as my mortal enemy and had no doubt that
he was one the infamous wretches employed by the
policy the inquisition and well known beneath those
hated roofs by the appellation moscas various reasons
may be assigned for my conduct in this particular let it
first be remembered that i was alone and for months had
not heard the sound my own voice no incident marked
my days j no object arrested my attention a dull heavy
pestilential souldepressing monotony formed the history
 my life if in this situation i had been visited by a
mouse or a rat i should indefatigably have sought to get
within reach it i should have put it to my bosom and have
felt with exultation the beat an animal pulse the warmth
 animal life pressing responsively on my heart with
what eager appetite i should have mixed in scenes calamity
and cruelty intolerable to any other eye glad for
myself that even upon such terms i could escape the frosts
travels op st leon
bound winter the soul how i should have rejoiced
like king richard england to see four grim and deathdealing
assassins enter my cell like him to struggle and
wrestle and contend with my murderers though as in his
case wounds and a fatal should be the result thus
feeling then it is little wonderful that i should have hailed
with pleasure the visit the musca
but this was not all while i conferred with or rather
listened to my visiter that pride and self complacency
which i suspect to be the main or at least the indispensable
ingredient all our pleasures revived in my heart i believed
that he was set upon me by these insatiable bloodsuckers
 the inquisition that he might ensnare me with
his questions and treacherously inveigle me to the faggot
and the stake i felt a last lambent intimation pride
within me when my heart whispered me this man shall
not attain his ends i secretly defied his arts and amused
myself with baffling his most cunning devices i had now
some one with whom to measure myself the comparison
i own for a descendant the counts st leon was a
humble one but it is not permitted a prisoner in the jails
 the inquisition to be fastidious in his pleasures this
man i played with at my ease and laughed at his stratagems
i therefore felt that i was his superior and which
was a sensation i had not lately been accustomed to that i
was somebody these feelings recommended to me his
visits
but what was much more material i looked further
and proposed an ultimate to this occurrence let it
be recollected what was my unhappiness when i found
myself if i may be allowed the expression suddenly deprived
 speech and then it will easily be understood how
sincerely i rejoiced to have this faculty restored to me
speech as i have already said i had regarded as the only
and assured means my deliverance from this scene 
horrors i therefore doubted not that from this miserable
tool my oppressors i would obtain my enlargement i
stood firmly on my guard i permitted him to run out
the whole length his own project without interruption
by this delay i should better understand his character and
travels op st leon 
finally seize it with a more decisive grasp thus purposing
i allowed three or four visits to pass before i opened to the
musca my own proposal i designed unexpectedly to turn
the tables upon him to surprise and finish with him at
once i knew not that all this precaution was necessary
but i played for too deep a stake not to be anxious to omit
nothing which hereafter in retrospect i might reproach
myself that i had omitted
the time was at length come at which i judged it convenient
to execute what i had planned in my mind i
began with an attempt to mortify and humble my guest in
his own eyes that he might lose the pride to make the
smallest resistance to my proposal
 do you think my good sir cried i that i have not
perfectly understood your intentions all this while you have
pretended to be my friend and to come to me for my good
i know that every secret i reposed in your fidelity every
word that i might unguardedly have dropped every look
and gesture that could have been interpreted to my disadvantage
would have been instantly reported to the fathers
 the inquisition why what a poor and miserable fool
must you have imagined me to be how came you into
my cell had you a secret key by which you found your
way hither unknown could you ever have come into my
apartment if you had not been employed you fawn
upon me and are the tame and passive agent my merciless
destroyers shame on such base and perfidious proceedings
 is this religion that you should flatter and
cajole and lie to a man purely that you may have the gratification
at last burning him alive if you or your
masters can make out any thing to my disadvantage let
them make it out in the way fair and open trial by the
production direct evidence and calling on me for my
defence they style themselves the champions christendom
and ornaments our holy faith they pretend to
an extraordinary degree sanctity and would have all men
bow down in mute reverence and astonishment at their
godliness and yet they have recourse to means so base
that the most profligate and abandoned tyrant upon
record would have disdained to employ them but base
travels op st leon
as are the judges and assessors the court in whose prison
i stand even they scorn the meanness the perfidious task
in which you have engaged
the vehemence i put into the suppressed and undertone
with which i delivered these reproaches seemed to produce
no emotion in my guest he dropped his staff upon his
shoulder he meekly folded his arms upon his bosom and
answered that he had long since learned to bear every
contumely for the cause god and the redeemer they
were heavendirected chastisements which his manifold sins
and iniquities had amply deserved
hypocrite replied i would you make me believe
that a conscientious motive can prompt such conduct as
yours can mould your features into a treacherous expression
 kindness and fill your mouth with lies and deceptions
innumerable 
no proceedings rejoined he with an unaltered air
are base that god and his church prescribe i take up
the cross with cheerfulness and glory in my shame the
more ignominious in the eyes an unregenerate world is
my conduct the more entire and implicit does it prove my
obedience to be
my heart swelled within me as he talked i could lend
no attention to such despicable cant and was ashamed to
see the most profligate conduct assuming to itself the pretensions
to an extraordinary degree sanctity and disinterestedness

come come said i dissembler i know that nothing
could buy a man to so loathsome an office but money
you are some galleyslave some wretch who by your complicated
crimes have forfeited your life to the community
and are now permitted to earn a miserable existence by
lying in wait for the unfortunate and engaging in arts at
which humanity shudders i take you upon your own
terms you are the man i want assist me to escape go

hand an estate six thousand pistoles per annum without
further condition waits your acceptance i invoke all
the powers sacred to truth and punishers deceit to
travels st leon s
witness that i have ability to make good the whole what
i promise
while i spoke i could perceive an extraordinary revolution
taking place in my guest the meekness and tranquillity
 his countenance subsided his eye became
animated and alive i hailed the auspicious omen i urged
my proposal with all the impetuosity i could exert and all
the arguments i could devise at length i paused i
looked again at the countenance the musca was less
pleased than before the expression did not seem to be
that assent and congratulation it was rather horror
and alarm
st ago and all the saints and angels heaven protect
me exclaimed he what do i hear a full
confession guilt and artthou then the confederate 
the prince the powers darkness if we were not herein
the holy house inquisition i should die at this moment
with fear that the roof would fall and crush us together
i should expect hell to swallow me alive for being found in
thy unhallowed society he trembled with every expression
 the sincerest terror and aversion
 thy money perish with thee thou second elias
like him full all subtlety and mischief child the
devil enemy all righteousness blasted be thy offers 
have i for this devoted myself to the service god assiduously
sought out the basest and vilest offices that
service and loaded myself with ignominy here that i might
obtain a crown glory hereafter and am i now to be assaulted
with the worst satan's temptations even so
lord if such be thy will oh poor miserable deluded
victim the archdeceiver mankind what has the devil
done for thee he has persuaded thee that thou art rich 
and thou wan test every joy and every necessary life
he has promised to be thy friend and he brings thee to
the faggot and flames in this world as an earnest thy
eternal damnation hereafter
my visiter had no sooner thus poured out the tumult and
agitation his soul than he left me abruptly and i saw
him no more
such was the event my attempt to bribe the officers 
travels st leon
the inquisition in my first experiment i could not even obtain
a hearing in what followed my proposals were rejected
with all the transports religious abhorrence what i
offered indeed however dazzling in the statement had not
in fact the nature a temptation he to whom i addressed
it gave no credit to my assertions he thought that i was
the mere drivelling dupe him he called the archdeceiver
 mankind or that my money when possessed would soon
change its figure and from seeming pieces solid coin be
converted into pieces horn or shells even if he had
not apprehended such a metamorphosis he would yet have
regarded every doubloon he received as the price his
continual adversity here and damnation hereafter i gained
nothing favourable for my situation by the trial i had made
but i added a new chapter to my knowledge human
nature i found that to be a knave it was not necessary
to be an infidel i corrected the too hasty conclusion which
i had adopted with the rest my contemporaries that he
whose conduct was infamous must inevitably be destitute
 religious impressions and belief and i became satisfied
that a man while he practised every vice that can disgrace
human nature might imagine he was doing god service
enough the interior the prison the inquisition
i remained a tenant this wretched mansion twelve years
though the wretch who had been placed upon me as a spy
was from my proposal to him satisfied my guilt his
superiors were not so they found nothing in what he
reported definitive as to the nature my unlawful practices
and they could extort from me no further confession
they therefore adhered to their favourite maxim to avoid
the precipitate mistakes other tribunals and to allow
their prisoner ful time to develop his guilt or as they pretended
to establish his innocence perhaps too the temper
 the prince who now filled the spanish throne contributed
to my safety they could not content themselves
with a less punishment for so obstinate and incorrigible a
heretic than that the flames but during the reign 
the emperor charles this species punishment for heresy
was rarely inflicted and only one or two contumacious at
intervals were delivered over to the executioner at a time
travels op st leon 
the institution whose victim i had become looked for a
richer and more abundant harvest from the wellknown
piety and zeal his successor
i pass over the rest the years my tedious imprisonment
they had in them a sad and deathlike uniformity
what surprising or agreeable adventures can be
expected from a man closed up within the four walls a
dungeon yet it is not altogether the uniformity this
period that determines me not to dwell upon and expand it
twelve years cannot pass in the life man without many
memorable incidents and occurrences he that should be
buried alive in the deepest cavern the earth if he were
not an idiot or incapable the task narration and could
subsist twelve years in that situation could tell things
that occurred to him that might fill the busy man the
world with thoughts and speculation almost to bursting i
might unfold the secrets my prisonhouse but that i
will not i refuse the consequences that story both to
my readers and myself i have no inclination to drive the
most delicate or susceptible my readers mad with horrors
i could convince such if such there are who suppose my
faculties were altogether benumbed or dead that it was not
so i did indeed pass days perhaps weeks in a condition
 that sort but at other times my mind was roused and
became busy restless impatient and inventive there was
no mode escape that i did not ruminate upon or attempt 
not to mention that though my body was restrained my
mind occasionally soared to the furthest regions the empyrean
or plunged into the deepest the recesses in which
nature conceals her operations all systems philosophising
became familiar to me i revolved every different
fable that has been constructed respecting the invisible
powers that superintend the events the boundless universe
and i fearlessly traced out and developed the boldest conjectures
and assertions demonism or atheism as the
humour the moment led me i derived misery or consolation

chapter xxxii
philip the second king spain succeeded to the throne
 that monarchy about the close the year but
his affairs in england and the netherlands long withheld
him from visiting his beloved country and he did not reach
its shores after a seven years absence till the twentyninth
 august it may be thought that a public event
 this sort could be little interesting to me a forgotten
prisoner immured in the dungeons the inquisition
the fact was otherwise the king was desirous distinguishing
his arrival on his native soil by some splendid
exhibition or memorable event that should at once express
his piety to god and conduce to the felicity his people 
and he could think nothing that so signally united
these characters as an auto de fe the lutheran heresy
which in the course forty years had spread its poison so
widely in the different countries europe had not failed
to scatter a few its noxious seeds even in this the
purest and most catholic all its divisions but philip
had early proclaimed his hostility against this innovation 
and prostrating himself before the image his saviour
had earnestly besought the divine majesty that he might
never suffer himself to be or to be called the lord those
in any corner the globe who should deny him the
lord previously to his arrival in spain directions had
been given and arrangements made respecting the pious
and solemn exhibition he demanded formerly those who
by the fathers the inquisition had been delivered over to
the secular arm had been executed in the different places
where their crimes had been committed or their trials been
held but now it was proposed that all those throughout
the kingdom who were found properly qualified to satisfy
by their deaths the sublime taste the royal saint should
be divided into two troops and sent the one to seville
long the capital an illustrious monarchy and the other
to valladolid which had the honour to be the birthplace
 the present sovereign the troop destined to feed the
travels st leon 
flames at seville was composed fifty persons many 
them distinguished for their rank their talents or their
virtues the troop to he escorted to valladolid which
i was a member amounted only to thirty but to compensate
this deficiency philip himself had signified his gracious
intention to be present together with the heir apparent and
his whole court at that exhibition the spanish nation
rejoicing in the approach a monarch who was born
among them whose manners and temper happily accorded
with theirs and whom they believed about to fix his perpetual
residence in their land expected him with all the
longings the most ardent attachment we the unhappy
victims pious and inquisitorial tyranny also expected him
our hearts did not pant with a less beating quickness 
though ourjanxiety arose from emotions a different nature
valladolid is distant from the metropolis eightyfour
miles we had already been some weeks prepared for this
journey and piously directed to hold ourselves in readiness
to take our part in the solemn national sacrifice we
waited however to receive a previous notice the day on
which the monarch would enter the place his birth
since so great was his royal zeal for the cause religion
and civil society that he would not consent to be absent
from any part the spectacle and accordingly it was not
allowed us to enter the scene our final destination till
the king spain and the indies should be already on the
spot and prepared to receive us the auto da fe performed
at seville had the precedence ours it took place
on the twentyfourth september and we were indulged
with an accurate account it and were present at a public
reading the record the act in the chapel our prison
previously to our removal from the metropolis
i will not enter into a minute detail the scene this
reading though the recollection will never be effaced from
my memory the persons present who were destined to
suffer capital punishment eight were women four 
them were taken from a single family being a grandmother
a mother and two daughters the noble house alcala
they had all been beautiful person and a graceful
figure the youngest the daughters was in the nineteenth
travels st leon
year her age their crime together with that the
majority their fellowsufferers was obstinate and impenitent
lutheranism the seats the women were separated
from the rest and fronted with a close lattice the
men were twentytwo in number and their appearance was
truly impressive their persons were neglected and their
figures emaciated j their eyes were sunk and ghastly and
their complexions a sallow and deathlike white most
 them were crippled by their long confinement and the
severities they had endured and were supported to their
seats upon an elevated scaffolding with benches raised one
above another by two apparatus one on each side the
condemned heretic god mercy and benevolence is it
possible that this scene should be regarded as thy triumph
and the execution destined to follow as a sacrifice acceptable
in thy sight if these papers mine are ever produced
to light may it not happen that they shall first be
read by a distant posterity who will refuse to believe that
their fathers were ever mad enough to subject each other to
so horrible a treatment merely because they were unable
to adopt each other's opinions oh no human affairs
like the waves the ocean are merely in a state ebb
and flow there is nothing new under the sun two
centuries perhaps after philip the second shall be gathered
to his ancestors he died in men shall learn over
again to persecute each other for conscience sake other
anabaptists or levellers shall furnish pretexts for new persecutions
 other inquisitors shall arise in the most enlightened
tracts europe and professors from their chair
sheltering their intolerance under the great names aristotle
and cicero shall instruct their scholars that a heterodox
doctrine is the worst crimes and that the philanthropy
and purity heart in which it is maintained only
render its defenders the more worthy to be extirpated
what were the ideas and reflections my fellows seated
on the benches above below and on either side me i
am unable to affirm my own could not fail to be pungent
and distressing i understood continually more and more
 the mysterious and unuttered history the stranger
who died in the summerhouse the lake constance 
travels st leon 
i found that i was only acting over again what he had
experienced before me his legacies had served to involve
me in the bitterest and most unheard miseries but were
wholly destitute ability to rescue from the evils themselves
created unbounded wealth i found to have no
power to bribe the dastard slaves religious bigotry and
the elixir immortality though it could cure disease and
put to flight the approaches age was impotent to repel
the fervour devouring flames i might have been happy
i was happy when the stranger found me i might
have lived to a virtuous and venerable old age and have
died in the arms my posterity the stranger had given
me wealth and i was now poorer than the peasant who
wanders amidst polar snows the stranger had given me
immortality and in a few days i was to expire in excruciating
tortures lie found me tranquil contented in the
midst simple yet inestimable pleasures he breathed into
me the restless sentiment ambition and it was that sentiment
which at length had placed me on high in the chapel
 the prison the catholic inquisition
our progress to valladolid was slow and solemn and
occupied a space no less than four days on the evening
 the fourth day we approached that city the king
and his court came out to meet us he saluted the inquisitor
general with all the demonstrations the deepest
submission and humility and then having yielded him
the place honour turned round his horse and accompanied
us to valladolid the cavalcade that attended the
king broke into two files and received us in the midst 
them the whole city seemed to empty itself on this memorable
occasion and the multitudes that crowded along
the road and were scattered in the neighbouring fields
were innumerable the day was now closed and the procession
went forward amidst the light a thousand torches
we the condemned the inquisition had been conducted
from the metropolis upon tumbrils but as we arrived at
the gates valladolid we were commanded for the greater
humiliation to alight and proceed on foot to the place 
our confinement as many as could not walk without assistance
being supported by the attendants we were
z 
 travels st leon
neither chained nor bound the practice the inquisition
being to deliver the condemned upon such occasions into
the hands two sureties each who placed their charge in
the middle between them and men the most respectable
characters were accustomed from religious motives to sue
for this melancholy office
dejected and despairing i entered the streets the city
no object present to the eyes my mind but that my
approaching execution the crowd was vast the confusion
inexpressible as we passed by the a narrow
lane the horse one the guards who rode exactly in a
line with me plunged and reared in a violent manner and
at length threw his rider upon the pavement others 
the horseguards attempted to catch the bridle the enraged
animal they rushed against each other several
 the crowd were thrown down and trampled under the
horses feet the shrieks these and the loud cries and
exclamations the bystanders mingled in confused and
discordant chorus no sound no object could be distinguished
from the excess the tumult a sudden thought
darted into my mind where all an instant before had been
relaxation and despair two or three the horses pushed
ffward in a particular direction a moment after they
resiled with equal violence and left a wide but transitory
gap my project was no sooner conceived than executed
weak as i had just now felt myself a supernatural tide 
strength seemed to come over me i sprung away with all
imaginable impetuosity and rushed down the lane i have
just mentioned every one amidst the confusion was attentive
to his personal safety and several minutes elapsed
before i was missed
chapter xxxiii
in the lane every thing was silent and the darkness was
extreme man woman and child were gone out to view
the procession for some time i could scarcely distinguish
a single object the doors and windows were all closed i
now chanced to come to an open door within i saw no
travels st leon 
one but an old man who was busy over some metallic work
at a chafingdish fire i had no room for choice i
expected every moment to hear the myrmidons the inquisition
at my heels i rushed in i impetuously closed
the door and bolted it j i then seized the old man by the
collar his shirt with a determined grasp and swore vehemently
that i would annihilate him that instant if he
did not consent to afford me assistance though for sometime
i had perhaps been feebler than he the terror that
now drove me on rendered me comparatively a giant he
intreated me to permit him to breathe and promised to do
whatever i should desire i looked round the apartment
and saw a rapier hanging against the wall which i instantly
proceeded to make myself master while i was
doing this my involuntary host who was extremely terrified
at my procedure nimbly attempted to slip by me and
rush into the street with difficulty i caught hold his
arm and pulling him back put the point my rapier to
his breast solemnly assuring him that no consideration on
earth should save him from my fury if he attempted to
escape a second time he immediately dropped on his
knees and with the most piteous accents intreated me to
spare his life i told him that i was no robber that id
not intend him the slightest harm and that if he would
implicitly yield to my direction he might assure himself
he never should have reason to repent his compliance by
this declaration the terrors the old man were somewhat
appeased i took the opportunity this calm to go to the
street door which i instantly locked and put the key in
my bosom
nothing but the most fortunate concurrence circumstances
could have thus forwarded my escape the rearing
 the horse the lifeguardsman was purely accidental
the concourse and press the crowd from all sides could
alone have rendered this circumstance any magnitude
the gap which was made by the pushing forwards and resiling
 the horses continued barely long enough for me to
spring through and closed again in an instant it is astonishing
that the thought escape should have thus suddenly
darted into my mind which but a moment before
z 
 travels st leon
was in a state dejection equally incompatible with activity
and with hope that in the lane down which i rushed
i should have met no human creature and that the first
open door i saw should lead to the residence a decrepid
old man who appeared to be its single inhabitant were
occurrences equally extraordinary yet seem to have been
both indispensable to my safety one point more concurred
with this fortunate train and assisted to still the
palpitations my beating heart i perceived by certain
indications in the countenance my host that he was by
parentage a jew i presently concluded that he was what
in spain they denominate a new christian for that otherwise
he would not have been allowed to reside at large in a
spanish city but upon that supposition i did not believe
that christianity was very deeply mingled up in him with
the vital principle the converts the inquisition are not
conspicuous for their sincerity now then for the first
time i thought in the course twelve years had opportunity
to communicate with a man whose soul was not
enslaved to the bloodthirsty superstition this devoted
country all i had seen during the period my confinement
were hyenas tigers and crocodiles they were not men
i had no sooner soothed my host into a temper to listen
to my story than i told him with all imaginable frankness
whence i came and to what i had been destined the
mention sorcery however and preternatural practices i
suppressed for i suspected that persons all religions
entertained an equal horror against these i suffered him
to imagine that the allegation against me had been the crime
 heresy all sects the christian superstition might be supposed
equally obnoxious or acceptable to a jew i emphatically
appealed to the persecutions which had been so long
directed against the religion his ancestors and observed
how disgraceful it would be in him to assist the operation
 a principle the effects which his fathers had so deeply
deplored and so perfectly abhorred i assured him that i
would bring him into no danger and that all i asked was
the protection a few hours i would leave him in the
course the following day and he should hear me no
more i reminded him that the danger he had to fear
was in betraying not in protecting me the inquisition
travels st leox 
looked upon every new christian with an eye the severest
jealousy and the mere fact if known that i had taken
refuge in his house would infallibly subject him to the
purgation a temporary imprisonment in their dungeons
it would be in vain for him to affirm that he had no choice
in what had occurred he was without a witness to confirm
his relation and the assertions a man born jewish
parents never obtained credit in the court the inquisition
i added with solemn asseverations that the moment i set
foot beyond the territory spain i would remit to him
the sum six hundred pistoles as an acknowledgment for
his kindness
during the whole my discourse i watched his countenance
with the utmost minuteness it gradually relaxed
from the terror which had at first appeared in it to expressions
 compassion and complacence i saw nothing
that ought to alarm me when it was his turn to speak
he earnestly assured me that he took a warm interest in
my story and would cheerfully perform every thing i required
he was happy that my favourable stars had led
me to his habitation and would rejoice to the latest hour
 his existence if they rendered him instrumental in preserving
the life a human being from so deplorable a
catastrophe while i talked to him i easily perceived that
the arguments i used which produced the most sensible
effect upon his features were those the dangers arising
to him from betraying me and the reward six hundred
pistoles which i promised him in the event my success
his motives however were blended together in his mind and
he had no sooner formed a determination grounded perhaps
upon the meanest considerations than he became eloquent
in a panegyric his own benevolence by which he was
not i believe more anxious to impose upon me than to
put the change upon himself i considered all that he said
his gestures and the very tones his voice with eager
anxiety the terror the inquisition penetrated to the
marrow in my bones and the fate awarded against me by
that court became inexpressibly more horrible to my thoughts
now that i saw the probability escaping it every thing
that i observed in the jew was apparently fair plausible
z 
hi travels st leon
and encouraging but nothing had power to quell the agitations
 my apprehensive soul
we were still engaged in discussing the topics have
mentioned when i was suddenly alarmed by the noise 
some one stirring in the inner apartment i had looked
into this room and had perceived nothing but the bed upon
which the old man nightly reposed himself i sprung up
however at the sound and perceiving that the door had a
bolt on the outside i eagerly fastened it i then turned
to mordecai such previously to his conversion had been
the name my host wretch said i did not you
assure me that there was no one but yourself in the house 
tf oh cried mordecai it is my child it is my child 
she went into the inner apartment and has fallen asleep on
the bed beware i answered die slightest falsehood
more shall instantly be expiated in your blood tf i
call abraham to witness rejoined the once more terrified
jew it is my child only my child tell me
cried i with severity accent how old is this child 
only five years said mordecai my dear leah died
when her babe was no more than a year old and though
we had several children this single one has survived her
speak to your child let me hear her voice he spoke
to her and she answered father want to come out
i was satisfied it was the voice a little girl turned to
the jew take care said i how you deceive me
now is there no other person in that room he imprecated
a curse on himself if there were i opened the
door with caution and the little girl came forward as
soon as i saw her i seized her with a rapid motion and
retired hack to a chair man said i you have trifled
with me too rashly you have not considered what am
escaped from and what i have to fear from this moment
this child shall be the pledge my safety i will not part
with her an instant as long as i remain in your house and
with this rapier in my hand i will pierce her to the heart
the moment i am led to imagine that i am no longer in
safety the jew trembled at my resolution the emotions
 a father worked in his features and glistened in his eye
at least let me kiss her said he be it so re
travels st leon 
plied i one embrace and then till the dawn the
coming day she remains with me i released my hold 
the child rushed to her father and he caught her in his
arms my dear leah cried mordecai now a sainted
spirit in the bosom our father abraham i call god to
witness between us that if all my caution and vigilance
can prevent it not a hair this child shall be injured 
stranger you little know by how strong a motive you have
now engaged me to your cause we poor jews hunted
on the face the earth the abhorrence and execration 
mankind have nothing but family affections to support us
under our multiplied disgraces and family affections are
entwined with our existence the fondest and bestloved
part ourselves the god abraham bless you my
child now sir speak what is it you require me 
i told the jew that i must have a suit clothes conformable
to the appearance a spanish cavalier and certain
medical ingredients that i named to him together with
his chafingdish coals to prepare them and that done
i would then impose on him no further trouble having
received his instructions he immediately set out to procure
what i demanded he took with him the key the
house and as soon as he was gone i retired with the
child into the inner apartment and fastened the door at
first i applied myself to tranquillise the child who had
been somewhat alarmed at what she had heard and seen 
this was no very difficult task she presently left me to
amuse herself with some playthings that lay scattered in a
corner the apartment my heart was now comparatively
at ease i saw the powerful hold i had on the fidelity 
the jew and firmly persuaded myself that i had no treachery
to fear on his part thus circumstanced the exertion
and activity with which i had lately been imbued left
me and i insensibly sunk into a sort slumber
the night was now far advanced and i was still reclined
insensible upon mordecai's bed when suddenly a jargon 
various sounds seemed from all sides to assail me my
mind was confused i heard something but seemed wholly
unconscious what i was and where i wanted to escape
from the disturbance but it continued and even increased
travels st leon
at length i was forced to command my attention and the
first thing i perceived was a beating at the door the
chamber the little girl was come to the bedside and endeavouring
to shake me sir sir she cried in an eager
accent my father wants to come in and i cannot slip the
bolt the door by slow degrees i began to comprehend
my situation and to recollect what had happened immediately
before i felt greatly alarmed i feared by the disturbance
that mordecai had not returned alone i essayed
to speak my organs refused their office i endeavoured
to move my limbs felt palsied and absolutely lifeless i
experienced a sinking and sickness heart that seemed to
be the immediate precursor death by listening occasionally
to the discourse which the father and the daughter
began to hold with each other i became satisfied that mordecai
was without a companion i endeavoured to make
the little girl understand that i was incapable rising from
the bed and having at length succeeded she communicated
the information to her father with considerable
trouble he loosened the door at its hinges and entered the
room i found myself in the extremest degree feeble and
languid the jew however assiduously administered to me
 cordials he had in his possession and by degrees i felt
myself considerably restored
now for the first time i was at leisure to attend to the
state my strength and my health my confinement in the
inquisition and the treatment i had experienced had
before rendered me feeble and almost helpless but these
appeared to be circumstances scarcely worthy attention
in the situation in which i was then placed the impulse
i felt in the midst the confusion in the grand street 
valladolid produced in me an energy and power exertion
which nothing but the actual experience the fact could
have persuaded me was possible this energy once begun
appeared to have the faculty prolonging itself and i did
not relapse into imbecility till the occasion seemed to be
exhausted which called for my exertion i examined myself
by a mirror with which mordecai furnished me i
found my hair as white as snow and my face ploughed with
a thousand furrows was now fiftyfour an age which
travels st leon 
with moderate exercise and a vigorous constitution often
appears like the prime human existence but whoever
had looked upon me in my present condition would not
have hesitated to affirm that i had reached the eightieth
year my age i examined with dispassionate remark the
state my intellect i was persuaded that it had subsided
into childishness my mind had been as much cribbed and
immured as my body i was the mere shadow a man
 no more power and worth than that which a magic lantern
produces upon a wall these are thy works superstition
 this the genuine and proper operation what is
called christianity let the reader judge what i had
passed through and known within those cursed walls by the
effects i have already refused i continue to refuse to tell
what i suffered and how those effects were produced
enough compassion enough complaint i will confine
myself as far as i am able to simple history
being recovered as far as the cordials and attention 
mordecai were capable recovering me i desired for the
remainder the night to be alone except that i was still
resolved to retain the little jewess as the pledge my
safety i was greatly obliged to my host for the punctuality
he had already displayed he had found considerable difficulty
in procuring the articles which i stood in need
owing partly to the lateness the hour and partly to the
presence the king and the general hurry and confusion
which had been produced by the solemn entry the inquisition
his efforts too to recover me from the languor and
lethargy into which i had sunk had a character generosity
 and perhaps i ought now to have trusted him without
a hostage but my heart was too earnestly bent upon
accomplishing its present object to afford harbour to the
punctilios delicacy the same earnestness caused me to
insist upon mordecai's repairing the injury which the
hinges the door had sustained and i was careful to
satisfy myself that every thing was restored to a state 
perfect security
i was now once again alone the little girl who had
been unusually disturbed and roused at an unseasonable
hour sunk into a profound sleep i heard the noise which
 travels st leon
mordecai made in undressing himself and composing his
limbs upon a mattrass which he had dragged for the present
occasion into the front room and spread before the
hearth i soon found by the hardness his breathing that
he also was asleep i unfolded the papers he had brought
me they consisted various medical ingredients i had
directed him to procure there were also two or three vials
containing syrups and essences i had near me a pair 
scales with which to weigh my ingredients a vessel 
water the chafingdish my host in which the fire was
nearly extinguished and a small taper with some charcoal
to delight the fire in case necessity while i was occupied
in surveying these articles and arranging my materials
a sort torpor came suddenly over me so as to allow meno
time for resistance i sunk upon the bed i remained
thus for about half an hour seemingly without the power 
collecting my thoughts at length i started felt alarmed
and applied my utmost force mind to rouse my exertions
while i drove or attempted to drive my animal spirits
from limb to limb and from part to part as if to enquire
into the general condition my frame i became convinced
that i was dying let not the reader be surprised at this 
twelve years imprisonment in a narrow and unwholesome
cell may well account for so sudden a catastrophe strange
and paradoxical as it may seem i believe it will be found in
the experiment that the calm and security which succeed to
great internal injuries are more dangerous than the pangs
and hardships that went before i was now thoroughly
alarmed i applied myself with all vigilance and expedition
to the compounding my materials the fire was gone
out the taper was glimmering in the socket to swallow
the julep when i had prepared it seemed to be the last
effort which my organs and muscles were capable it
was the elixir immortality exactly made up according to
the prescription the stranger
whether from the potency the medicine or the
effect imagination i felt revived the moment i had
swallowed it i placed myself deliberately in mordecai's
bed and drew over me the bedclothes i fell
asleep almost instantly i believe my first sleep was
travels st leon 
perfectly sound and insensible but in no long time i was
visited with the pleasantness dreams imaginable nothing
was distinct nothing was attended with the consciousness
 my former identity but every thing was gay cheerful
invigorating and delicious i wandered amidst verdant
lawns and flowerenamelled gardens i was saluted with
the singing a thousand birds and the murmuring a
thousand fountains kids fawns and lambs frisked and
gamboled before me at a distance through an opening
in the trees i discerned nymphs and their swains dancing
a variety antic measures i advanced towards them 
they approached towards me fifes oboes recorders and
instruments a hundred names commenced a cheerful
and melodious concert myself and the dancers now were
met they placed me in the midst them they began a
choral song the motion their limbs conformed to their
numbers i was the theme the general chaunt they
ascribed to me the beauty apollo the strength 
hercules the invention mercury and the youth 
bacchus
my sleep was not long in a few hours i awakened
with difficulty i recognised the objects about me and
recollected where i had been it seemed to me that my
heart had never beat so vigorously nor my spirits flowed
so gay i was all elasticity and life i could scarcely hold
myself quiet i felt impelled to bound and leap like a kid
upon the mountains i perceived that my little jewess
was still asleep she had been unusually fatigued the night
before i know not whether mordecai's hour rising
were come if it were he was careful not to disturb
his guest i put on the garments he had prepared 
i gazed upon the mirror he had left in my apartment
i can recollect no sensation in the course my life so
unexpected and surprising as what i felt at that moment
the evening before i had seen my hair white and
my face ploughed with furrows i looked fourscore what
i beheld now was totally different yet altogether familiar 
it was myself myself as i had appeared on the day my
marriage with marguerite de damville the eyes the
mouth the hair the complexion every circumstance point
by point the same i leaped a gulf thirtytwo years i
 travels st leon
waked from a dream troublesome and distressful beyond
all description but it vanished like the shades night
upon the burst a glorious morning in july and left nota
trace behind i knew not how to take away my eyes
ffdm the mirror before me
i soon began to consider that if it were astonishing tome
that through all the regions my countenance i
could discover no trace what i had been the night before
it would be still more astonishing to my host this sort
 sensation i had not the smallest ambition to produce one
 the advantages the metamorphosis i had sustained
consisted in its tendency in the eyes alt that saw me to
cut off every species connection between my present and
my former self it fortunately happened that the room in
which i slept being constructed upon the model many
others in spain had a stair at the further with a trapdoor
in the ceiling for the purpose enabling the inhabitant
to ascend on the roof in the cool the day the
roofs were flat and so constructed that there was little difficulty
in passing along them from house to house from one
 the street to the other i availed myself the
opportunity and took leave the residence my kind
host in a way perfectly unceremonious determined however
speedily to transmit to him the reward i had promised it
may easily be believed that mordecai was not less rejoiced
at the absence a guest whom the vigilance the inquisition
rendered an uncommonly dangerous one than i was
to quit his habitation i closed the trap after me and
clambered from roof to roof to a considerable distance at
length i encountered the occasion an open window and
fortunately descended unseen by any human being into
the street having with difficulty succeeded on this occasion
 public solemnity in engaging an apartment in one
 the hotels valladolid i sent into it as soon as i was
able a chest containing every necessary apparel and
particularly a suit clothes i then changed my dress
and threw the clothes which mordecai had provided into
the chest i had purchased as long as they continued
safely locked up and the key in my possession no faculty
possessed by any human creature could detect my identity
and expose me afresh to my former jailors the only
travels st leon 
peril under which i had before laboured was from mordecai
who if he had seen me in the garments he had procured
might have recognised them and though a peril
from this source came barely within the limits possibility
it was easily avoided and i therefore chose to avoid it
i passed the whole this day in a species enjoyment
which as it has no parallel in the ordinary transactions 
mankind so are there no terms in the received languages 
the world that are adequate to the description it it has
often been a subject melancholy and complaint among
mortals that while the whole vegetable system contains in
it a principle perpetual renewal man alone the ornament
and lord the universe man knows no return to
youth when the sun declines in the west the flowers
droop and fold up their frail and delicate leaves but soon
the eyelids the morn are again opened and again they
rejoice in his invigorating beams upon the approach 
winter the beech the ash and the monarchoak scatter
their withered foliage over the plains but spring reappears
and nakedness is no longer their reproach and they clothe
themselves anew in their leafy honours with what a
melancholy sensation does the old man survey his decaying
limbs to me he cries there is no second morning and
no returning spring my head pressed down with years
shall never again erect itself in conscious manhood these
hoary locks shah no more be adorned with the auburn 
glossy youth my weatherbeaten trunk shall at no time
clothe itself with a smoother rind a recruited marrow
shall never fill these bones nor a more vigorous sap circulate
through my unstrung limbs i recollect what i was
in the prime manhood with vain regrets the memory
answers no other than to torment and upbraid me
the useless wish the old man the object his hopeless
sigh was mine common and everyday blessings have
little value in the eye their possessor the young man
squanders the endowments youth and knows not to prize
them if the young man had once been old if the old man
could again be young then and then only they would
justly estimate their wealth the springy limb the bounding
frame the vigour that sets fatigue at defiance and
 travels st leon
revels in pleasures exhausted would then by the near
and conscious comparison feebleness and lassitude the
drooping limb the aching head and the frame decayed in
all its senses be well understood such was my situation
yesterday i was fourscore today i was twenty yesterday
i was a prisoner crippled in every articulation today
i was a citizen the world capable all its delights
tomorrow i was destined to have been dragged to the
stake with ignominy and to suffer intolerable anguish amidst
the shouts and huzzahs an unfeeling populace tomorrow
i was at liberty to employ as i pleased to choose the theatre
upon which it should be spent and the gratifications that
should be crowded into it what was most material my
mind was grown young with my body weary eternal
struggle i had lately resigned the contest and sunk under
the illfortune that relentlessly pursued me now i felt
within me a superfluity vigour i panted for something
to contend with and something to conquer my senses unfolded
themselves to all the curiosity remark my thoughts
seemed capable industry unwearied and investigation the
most constant and invincible ambition revived in my
bosom j i longed for new engagements and new relations 
i desired to perform something that i might myself regard
with complacence and that i might see the world start at
and applaud
i determined for reasons that i shall presently have occasion
to unfold that my first visit should be to my daughters
at my paternal estate st leon i proposed to spend
two or three days in preparations for this journey by
mere accident by a most censurable heedlessness i became
in some degree a spectator the auto da fe in which i
was destined to have been a victim unawares i had become
entangled in the crowd and could with difficulty
escape or even prevent my being carried nearer the centre
 the scene i saw the galleries and accommodations that
had been erected for the spectators i saw the windows and
roofs the houses crowded with beholders the shrieks
 the sufferers i could not hear they were drowned in the
infernal exultations the multitude but what was worst
 all i discerned some the condemned fixed as they
travels op st leon 
were upon small boards near the top stakes about four
yards high and therefore greatly above the heads the
assembly while the flames abundantly fed with faggots and
dry fuel climbed aloft and seemed eager to embrace their
victims as i have already said there were thirty these
deathdevoted frames and if my eye did not count them
all my fancy well supplied what sense was unable to discover
the impression i felt at that moment was horrible
beyond all conception i exerted my newfound strength
and pushed out the press with irresistible vigour if at
that instant i could have felt exultation even in the consciousness
 my own safety i should regard myself as the
most execrable monsters
chapter xxxiv
the first employment in which i purposed to engage my
newfound liberty and youth was a visit to my daughters
i now carried a disguise perpetually about with me that
would render my journey incapable proving injurious to
them my daughters were all that remained if indeed they
still remained my once idolised family for twelve
years i had continued totally ignorant their fortune and
even their existence part the plan i had adopted
for their advantage necessarily precluded me from all correspondence
or communication with them or any one near
them that might satisfy and tranquillise the anxieties a
father if it had been otherwise deprived as i had been
 the common benefits light and air and cast out from
the society mankind i could have obtained no intelligence
 their welfare in visiting i determined not to
make myself known to them yet notwithstanding the
greatness this disadvantage i felt that one the most
exquisite gratifications the earth could afford me was to
behold my children what a multitude adventures and
incidents might they not have encountered in the space 
twelve years imagination and affection dwell impatiently
on the interval nor can any thing quiet the conjectures 
a a
 travels st leon
him that loves short the most complete information
what a difference must twelve years have produced in the
very persons and figures creatures so young with what
mingled and exquisite emotions does the father contemplate
his daughter whom he left a child grown up into a woman
he sees her with astonishment and rapture displaying
maturer beauties discovering in her countenance new traces
 knowledge and sentiment and in her gesture and manners
a character finished matronly and sedate the very
circumstance that i should visit them unknown and converse
intimately with them without being discovered while
it cut me off from many pure and ingenuous pleasures
added in some respects a new relish to the indulgence for
it gave it a character singular and perhaps unprecedented
in the history mankind i anticipated with eager transport
the hour at which i should revisit the place my
birth wander amidst the shades where my careless infancy
had strayed recognise objects made sacred to my heart by
associations with my venerable mother and my adorable
wife now illumined with the presence my children
and steal a joy unsuspected and unknown to which the
very secrecy with which it was ravished would give a
tenfold gust
i embraced the nearest route by pampeluna and the
pyrenees to the banks the garonne one particular
pleasure that i reaped during this tour which the climate
and scenery might alone have rendered delightful consisted
in the youthful sensation with which every thing i saw
was enjoyed every one who can call to mind the amusements
 his childhood will be conscious that during that
period all his senses were in a tone adapted to convey the
most exquisite gratification this is not merely as is
vulgarly supposed the result the novelty and freshness
with which at that time every thing strikes us the extremities
 the nerves are in a state the most delicate
susceptibility upon which no touch however slight and
evanescent is lost and which makes us upon every occasion
favourable to enjoyment gasp and tremble with the
pleasure we imbibe we feel it thrilling through every
pulse and communicating its tone to every part our attravels
 st leon 
mention is engrossed by a single object or if we are
sensible to accompanying incidents it spreads over them
an animating sunshine and totally varies their appearance
and hue age on the contrary imperceptibly brings
along with it callosity and sluggishness sensation out
gratifications are coldly relished and our desires feebly
awakened such is the difference in our perception 
delicious fruits fragrant smells smooth and glossy
surfaces the vividness colour and the heavenly
sweetness sound if this be a just account i leave the
reader to imagine how i enjoyed my tour from valladolid
to the beautiful and romantic retirement st leon
there was however one sentiment with which i was at
this time impressed that i shall find it difficult to make
the reader understand in the extent in which i felt it and
that formed a powerful drawback upon the pleasures i have
just described a short time ago i had been old now i
was young i had quaffed the elixir immortality
the revolution this had produced in my sentiments was
not less memorable than that which it had effected in my
corporeal lineaments and my mental elasticity it is so
different a thing to conceive a proposition theoretically
and to experience it in practice the case is parallel to
that the expectation which an ordinary christian entertains
 eternal bliss it is an article in his creed he
repeats it every night when he lies down and every morning
when he rises he would be both offended and surprised
if you told him he was riot persuaded it and
yet how faint and indistinct a picture it produces in his
intellectual retina the affairs the world strike him
with all the force vision to them he cannot make himself
a stranger and a pilgrim he cannot transfer all his
affections to the mere creature his imagination engendered
in solitude and nurtured by enthusiasm heaven
how different must have been the feelings the celebrated
apostle who had been taken up into the third heaven and
had beheld the new jerusalem with all its jaspers its chrysalis
its emeralds and its sapphires 
my situation was similar to this i had long known as
far as reflection could assure me it that i possessed the
a a 
 travels st leon
elixir immortality but never till now had i felt the
julep tingling in my veins and known the effects it in
every joint and articulation my frame i before believed
i now felt that i was immortal the consequence this
intimate persuasion was not without its portion melancholy
i still bore the figure and lineaments a human
creature but i knew that i was not what i seemed there
was a greater distance between me and the best constructed
and most consummate the human species than there is
between him and an ant or a musket crushed by the first
accidental tread or consumed by the first spark wafted by
the wind i can no longer cheat my fancy i know that
i am alone the creature does not exist with whom i have
any common language or any genuine sympathies society
is a bitter and galling mockery to my heart it only shows
in more glaring colours my desolate condition the nearer
i attempt to draw any the nominal ties our nature
the more they start and shrink from my grasp from this
moment i could not shake off the terrible impression my
hmelines no not for an hour often does this impression
induce me to regard my immortality with loathing indescribable
 often do i wish to shelter myself from it in the
sweet oblivion the grave from this hour i had no
passions no interests no affections my heart has never
expanded with one natural emotion i have never delivered
myself up to the repose one genuine amusement if at
any time i have had a glimpse pleasure it has irritated
only to deceive it has increased the appetite while it displayed
in stronger colours my impotence to gratify it
what is worse every added year has still subtracted something
from the little poignancy and relish which the bowl
 human life continued to retain i have the power 
assuming a youthful and glossy appearance whenever i think
proper but this is only a bitter mockery the furrows
ploughed in my heart in so much my adventures as
remains for me to describe i feel that i shall be obliged to
employ the established terms human description i cannot
interrupt the history my sensations by a recital 
those pangs by which they have been every moment interrupted
the terms i must use may delude the reader into
travels st leon 
an imagination that i still participate enjoyment and 
hope be it so they may cheat the reader they cannot
cheat myself 
previously to my arrival in the vicinity the garonne
i equipped myself in the habit an armenian and assumed
the character a merchant travelling from country
to country for the sale his commodities
it was in the close a wintry day in the bleak and
cheerless month december that i first viewed from a
distance the turrets st leon i procured myself accommodations
for the night in the adjoining village being
now after so long an absence within reach the residence
 these lovely treasures i sought without any direct consciousness
 the sentiment to delay our interview when
i entered the little auberge sheltered under a small plantation
 olives i dreaded to hear the repetition my family
name i longed most fervently to be informed the welfare
 my daughters yet i could have died sooner than
utter a single question on the subject i found that that
ardent love which had urged me with rapid steps from valladolid
to st leon gradually as the distance grew little
changed from an impetuous vehemence to hear and to
see them to fearful awestruck motionless anxiety their
light and airy figures as i last saw them at montauban in
 danced before the eyes my imagination what
casualties what calamities might not have overtaken them
since i was afraid almost to breathe lest i should dissolve
the unreal scene that played around me how did i know
that i did not indulge this cheerful imagination for the last
time again and again in the course the evening i felt
as if i could have wasted ages in this auberge and the
neighbouring fields still believing that my daughters inhabited
yonder towers still hovering round their fancied
residence but never daring to utter their name lest it should
be found the prelude to some fatal intelligence how rich
and refined a repast in some cases is uncertainty it had the
power to impart to these precious pledges a share that immortality
 which i was the destined monopolist
why had i not the courage never to overpass the limit
at which i was now arrived and wherever i afterwards
aa 
 travels st leon
wandered on the various surface the globe still to be
able to repeat to myself the complacent whisper i have
visited my daughters in their separated abode and my visit
was productive none but agreeable sensations my
passions were too much afloat to suffer me really to rest in
this patient contemplative gratification before the morning's
dawn i walked forth and turned my eyes towards
the castle i loitered from bank to bank and from point
to point daylight slowly broke in upon me but all was
silent and quiet in my paternal chateau the family is
not yet stirring said i to myself i turned my steps to
the spot where the ashes my mother were mingled with
their parent earth the time that had intervened since
her decease the various fortunes and impressions i had
experienced had somewhat obliterated the vividness her
picture in my memory and deadened the tremblingness 
sensation with which i once thought her yet enough
was left to make it an interesting moment to me when i
kneeled at her tomb why oh why as it had been with
my great forefathers was it not a moment exultation tome
when i thus feelingly saluted the shade a parent 
he that exults in such an hour must feel that he has
illustrated his birth and honoured his progenitors i had
done nothing this i was an exile on the face the
earth had acquired no trophies and accumulated no fame
i had none to honour none even to know me i had no
family i had no friend these bitter recollections started
up in array before me and cut me to the heart the spirit
 my mother frowned upon her son and i returned along
the path by which i came disgraced and disconsolate
i am now said i in a fit temper to learn intelligence
 my daughters if they have been unhappy to
hear it will not make me more forlorn if they have been
fortunate that knowledge and that alone may revive my
courage i hastened towards the avenue i looked into
the thickets and winding paths as i passed they communicated
to me mingled pictures my own boyish days
and the amusements the present inhabitants
i told the nature my pretended traffic to the servants
 the house and proposed an exhibition my commodus
 st leon 
ties i was admitted as i desired to the apartment 
their mistresses i saw two young ladies who appeared
to be respectively about twentyeight and twentyfour years
 age and whom without much difficulty i recognised for
my daughters louisa and marguerite their situation and
their ages identified them and when afterwards i came to
peruse their features attentively i could easily discover
traits the amiable young woman and the playful child
they had been when last we parted i found them employed
upon a piece embroidery a comely and respectable
looking young woman a servant was sewing in another
part the room every thing about the ladies
bespoke the ease their circumstances and the propriety
 their sentiments both had on an elegant morninghabit
both had an air sedateness and sobriety that to
my apprehension told that they had not lived unchastened
by misfortune
they each slightly looked up as i was ushered into the
apartment they saluted me with a graceful and condescending
bend the head such as we are accustomed to
use to an inferior whom we are willing to put at his ease
what were my sensations a father disguised and unknown
in the presence his children i attempted to stand as
is usual for a tradesman when he waits on his customers
at their own house i attempted to speak my tongue
refused its office my legs tottered as if sustaining an unusual
weight louisa observed me and desired me to be
seated i had no power choice i accepted her civility
no sooner was i seated than in spite myself a flood 
tears gushed from my eyes she was astonished she
begged to know if i were indisposed she requested me to
make use every assistance the house could afford now
found my speech i apologised for my behaviour said i
had felt suddenly ill but that the tears i shed would prove
the most effectual relief to me my appearance it may be
proper to mention was not that a vulgar pedlar it was
tall graceful and ingenuous with a certain air refinement
and politeness my armenian dress though formed
 unjustly materials was such as to display my person to
considerable advantage both the young ladies showed
a a 
 travels st leon
themselves interested in the symptoms my distress
after a few minutes internal struggle i rose made an excuse
for the abruptness my departure and requested
permission to repeat my visit in the afternoon when i
should have something not unimportant to communicate to
them
i had seen two my daughters had been satisfied
that they still existed i had witnessed their exterior health
and beauty as i withdrew i laid my hand upon my heart
and congratulated myself thus far said i it is well 
i felt relieved from part the weight that lay there with
my right hand i struck upon my forehead but oh where
cried i ff is my other daughter the thought came over
me with the force a demonstration she is dead a
servant was attending me to the door i requested to speak
to the housekeeper i was introduced to mariana chabot
she was struck with my appearance as i believe my daughters
had been as if my features were those some person
with whom she was intimately acquainted she would
probably have mistaken me for my own son but that i
looked considerably too young i intreated her to pardon
my curiosity but i assured her i had a particular reason to
interest myself in the family monsieur st leon and i
therefore requested that she would have the goodness to
inform me their affairs as far as she could with propriety
communicate them to a person who was not so
happy as to be in the catalogue their acquaintance i
told her that i had just seen two her ladies but that i
had understood there had been three and i particularly desired
some information as to the young lady who had not
made her appearance in the parlour my presentiment was
true the impression that smote me when i left the parlour
was her funeral knell my beloved julia was dead 
she had been dead four years if it had not been for the
agitation my mind when i visited the tomb my
venerable parent i should have discovered her monument
near that her grandmother that would have been too
overwhelming a mode learning the painful intelligence 
i was glad at least to have escaped that 
in this and some subsequent conversations i held with
travels st leon sel
this respectable matron i learned a variety particulars
respecting my daughters madame chabot expressed herself
sorry that she had nothing pleasing to communicate
her young ladies had been pursued by a train misfortunes
though heaven knew they had merited every happiness
a few years after they had been settled at st leon
julia had been addressed by a lover in every sense worthy
 her he was rich noble a gallant spirit a cultivated
understanding and a truly kind and affectionate
heart their attachment had been long and tried habit
and experience each other's virtues had caused it to take
a deep root the father the young man had destined
him to marry the daughter a duke and peer the
kingdom but finding his affections unalterably fixed he
had at length yielded and sanctioned their mutual passion
with his consent every thing was now prepared for the
nuptials a day was fixed and the appointed time was fast
approaching just at this juncture the father changed his
mind and became more obstinate and inexorable than ever
a report had begun to be circulated that monsieur st leon
the father the young ladies was still alive madame
chabot expressed her fear that this report had originated in
some indiscretion bernardin who however had always
proved himself a most zealous and faithful servant and who
had since paid the debt nature be that as it might
the father the lover julia was found no longer accessible
to expostulation or entreaty he was an avaricious
disposition and he regarded the fortune the young lady
which would otherwise have been considerable as entirely
alienated and annihilated by this flaw in the title but
what was more material it by no means accorded with his
ideas nobility and honour that the fatherinlaw his
only son should be a fugitive and a wanderer with whose
residence no one was acquainted and whom no one
could tell whether he were living or dead the manner
in which the ladies had entered into the repossession 
their paternal estate when minutely investigated was
thought to have something in it an ambiguous and unpleasant
nature it was well known that monsieur st leon
had left the country in consequence his having ruined
travels st leon
himself by the vice gaming surely said some it is
a little mysterious how his children came after an interval
 nine years to be able to repurchase all he ever possessed
in short the more the old vicomte was reasoned with the
more furious he grew at length he made use the
power which the government france vests in the father
 a family and shut up his son in one the royal prisons
this was a fatal blow both to the chevalier and his
mistress disappointed in the object his warmest affections
maltreated and disgraced by the severity a father
his health sensibly declined nothing however could shake
the inflexibility the vicomte he would release his son
upon no other terms than a renunciation his love terms
which the sense dignity and honour in the young gentleman
equally with his passion forbade him to accept to
all representations the necessity granting liberty to
his son if he would not make himself answerable for his
death the vicomte sternly replied that he preferred his
dying to the idea his connecting himself with a family
 dishonour it was not till a few weeks before he expired
that the father had consented to his release from
prison and had removed him to one his castles in a
remote province but the malady the chevalier was
found incurable the vital principles the system were
fatally deranged the lover died and the consequences
 this unhappy affair had put a premature close to the
existence the unfortunate julia madame chabot added
that the circumstance this story having become a subject
 public animadversion it had had a most unfavourable
effect on the prospects the surviving sisters they bore
their situation with dignity but they could not but feel
the unhappy coincidence which cut them off from the
happiest condition human life an honourable and well
assorted settlement in marriage
while madame chabot related to me the tragical history
 julia i felt convulsed with passion and more than once
burst into an agony tears fatal legacy atrocious secrets
 medicine and chemistry every day opened to my astonished
and terrified sight a wider prospect their wasteful
effects a common degree penetration might have
travels st leon s
shown me that secrets this character cut off their possessor
from the dearest ties human existence and render
him a solitary cold selfcentered individual his heart no
longer able to pour itself into the bosom a mistress or a
friend his bosom no longer qualified to receive upon equal
terms the overflowing a kindred heart but no mere
exercise imagination nothing short the actual experience
through which i had passed could have adequately
represented the mischiefs a thousand various
names that issued from this pandora's box this extract 
a universal panacea i regarded myself as the murderer 
these two lovers than whom i concluded from my personal
observation the one and all that i heard the
other two purer and more affectionate beings more singularly
qualified to form each other's happiness had never
existed i felt as truly haunted with the ghosts those i
had murdered as nero or caligula might have been my
wife my son my faithful negro and now in addition to
these the tender julia and her unalterable admirer i possessed
the gift immortal life but i looked on myself asa
monster that did not deserve to exist
it is with difficulty that i shall be able to make the
reader understand how much more severe the impression
 this last catastrophe was made to me by the place and
time in which i received the intelligence we are creatures
 sensation our worst calamities derive as much their
pungency from the accessories by which they are accompanied
as they do from their intrinsic evil if i had heard
this story at any other period i am persuaded its effects
would not have been half so painful the idea my
daughters was faded in my sensorium and whatever related
to them though really felt and felt like a father
would have been felt with a less overpowering interest
but now i had journeyed from valladolid to the garonne
to behold them i had surveyed the castle they inhabited
i had viewed the garden which they arranged
with their hands i had entered the parlour which they
adorned with their presence all this controlled the operation
 absence and distance i felt at this moment
as if i had been accustomed to see them every day and to
 travels st leon
regard them as inseparable from my existence i experienced
as it were the united effect familiarity and
novelty i felt the melancholy fate julia with all the
keenness an inmate and all the surprise a long absent
traveller the very metamorphosis i had undergone gave
new poignancy to my distress madame chabot tortured
me deliberately and at leisure without the slightest consciousness
 what she was doing she believed she was
pouring a tale persons unknown into the ears a native
 the other hemisphere at the moment that she was calling
up in arms the strongest and most excruciating feelings 
a father for his child i on the other hand had the most
violent struggle with myself while i endeavoured to suppress
the appearances an emotion which to the person
who witnessed them must have been for ever unaccountable
as it was and in spite all my efforts madame chabot
betrayed no little amazement at the agitation with which i
listened to a story in which as she apprehended i could
have no personal interest
what i heard from madame chabot suggested to me a
conduct which i resolved to adopt under the present circumstances
in my next interview i told louisa that i
would now account to her for emotions which at the time
they occurred must have appeared somewhat extraordinary
i owned that i had been acquainted with her father i said
that i had first met with him in a journey in which i was
then engaged through the province mesopotamia that
i had received from him though a stranger a singular
obligation that a sincere friendship between us had been
the result this event that he died about two years since
that i had attended him in his last moments that he had
charged me with his dying recommendations and requests 
and that my present journey into france had principally
been instigated by a desire to visit his children i then
delivered into her hands various letters and papers which i
had counterfeited chiefly with the intention supplying my
daughters with legal evidence the decease their father
louisa listened to what i related with those marks affection
and sorrow which are inseparable from the habits
 a well constituted mind the emotion she discovered
travels st leon 
led me farther than i first intended i was urged by an
irresistible impulse to practise beyond what the occasion
demanded upon the feelings her virtuous mind i know
not whether this is to be considered as a vain refinement
and a criminal curiosity but i think every generous
spirit will excuse me when it is recollected that this covert
and imperfect proceeding was all that was left me to soothe
the impatient cravings a father's heart from time to
time i reminded her particulars that it was scarcely possible
any one but her father should know i conjured up
past scenes i made all the revolutions her youth pass
successively in review before her i touched all the pulses
 her soul sometimes she was fixed in mute astonishment
at the exactness my information and was ready todo
me homage as some aerial genius who condescended to
clothe himself in this earthly figure at other times astonishment
was swallowed up in feeling her soul dissolved in tenderness
and she appeared ready fl to faint into my arms it is
scarcely possible to depict the pleasurable sensations i drew
from these intercourse i know not whether they were
entirely innocent but this i know that in me they produced
a sentiment innocence and a sentiment paradise
i felt sometimes as if i could have wasted ages in this sort
 gratification
as the executor their father my daughters received
me with every mark respect but after having already
protracted my visit to them for the space many days i
felt that i should be guilty something alike hostile to
their decorum and reputation if i did not speedily bring it
to a termination i was a person unknown and almost
without a name nor could it be proper for a young woman
to continue to receive the visits a person her own age
and a different sex upon the intimate and confidential
footing upon which my visits were paid except in the case
 him whom she intends to make her husband to considerations
 this sort i was obliged to sacrifice the gratifications
in which i had lately been indulging my principal
concern at st leon from the time in which madame
chabot had communicated to me the real nature my
daughter's situation was to r pt nave those disadvantages in
 travels op st leon
which my destiny and my errors had involved them it
would therefore have been the extreme inconsistency in
me while i was healing one mischief to prepare for them
another it is not indeed probable that i should long have
been contented for myself with this anomalous and neutral
situation in which i more resembled a piece furniture
endowed with the faculty noting the sensations those
around me than the member any human society it
was high time as i thought even in this point view
that i should put an to the inglorious scene should appear
in some real character and engage in some real undertaking

influenced by these considerations i now quitted the residence
 my daughters i had satisfied the longing curiosity
 a father had seen their situation had witnessed
their beauty their accomplishments and their virtues if
i had been afflicted at hearing the premature fate my
eldest daughter if i had been agonised by the reflection
that i might justly regard myself as her murderer who was
so fitted to suffer this anguish as myself the outcast my
species what right had i to expect to be happy in my own
person or prosperous in any my relations the guilty
cause all this mischief it was but suitable that it should
be brought home to my own bosom that it should tear and
distract my own brain add to this i was not without a
hope that my journey would not be found useless to the
survivors by furnishing to them the proper documents to
certify the death their father i flattered myself that i
had cut them off more effectually than before from all connection
with my unpropitious destiny and had placed them
nearly upon a footing with the other noble and unmarried
heiresses their native country i have nothing further
to relate in regard to these two amiable and excellent sisters
from the time that i quitted st leon upon this occasion
to the time in which i am now writing the opportunity 
making further enquiries respecting them has not occurred
to me if ever it does occur i have only this one wish to
entertain which if granted will i am sure satisfy my
fondest hopes may i find they have been as happy as
they so well deserve to be 
travels st leon

the parting between me and my daughters was not an
affecting one on my part whose bosom was fraught
with a thousand tender feelings to which i could give no
language and which those whom they principally concerned
had not the slightest suspicion it could not be affecting
nor did louisa and her younger sister look with
an indifferent eye upon the bearer the last sentiments 
their father the witness his death the executor his
will there was something in the features my countenance
a peculiar sort conformation a family resemblance
to themselves which it is probable they did not advert to
but which i am persuaded wrought within them to the full
extent the mysterious sympathies our nature i pretended
to have been the familiar confident their father i
told them things at which they started and almost blushed
to think that any one beyond the circuit their dearest
relations should have been privy in the hour our separation
they shed many tears and embraced me with a
warmth that might have well become sisters to a brother
yet shall i confess my weakness a weakness in which i
do not apprehend myself to be singular it happens to
few men to witness the manner in which the story their
own deaths is received if it did i believe we all us
have enough vanity and personal feeling however sincere
a grief might show itself in the demeanour survivors to
find it falling short our appetites and demand this i
know i was myself a party to this unreasonableness my
daughters received the intelligence my death with a decorum
and sensibility which in the eyes every impartial
spectator would have reflected honour on their characters
a sensibility beyond what could have been imagined in
daughters who now had not seen their father for twelve
years yet it was an unpleasing reflection to me thus to
have occasion to gauge their love and to say this is the
exact measure their affection i remained in this part 
the world long enough to see my children consoled and
myself forgotten selfimportance man upon how slight
a basis do thy gigantic erections repose 
 travels op st leon
chapter xxxv
from st leon i proceeded to the kingdom hungary
to complete this journey i must pass through near twenty
degrees longitude but that was a trivial consideration 
what i most desired was to gain a new situation and enter
upon an untried scene i had determined in my next experiment
upon the endowments the stranger to make no
halfformed efforts and to suffer no mischiefs that drew
their source from my own irresolution i determined as
i have said to forestall all opposition by my firmness and
to silence all objectors by the display a more than princely
magnificence i thought it therefore eligible to remove to
a scene where no encounter with any one i had ever known
might abash me and no relation any adventure i had ever
met should follow me the change my figure it is true
would render an encounter this sort little moment to
my liberty or my reputation but i was a new man and
i was desirous to engross and to feel the benefits that attend
upon novelty
there was another motive however secretly working at
my heart a grander and more exalted cast that made
me prefer hungary to all the countries the earth hungary
had been now for upwards a century the great
frontier the christian world the theatre upon which
the followers mahomet contended against the followers 
jesus for destruction and for empire my mind had from
time to time brooded over this picture in the solitude and
forlornness my dungeon i ruminated on all the calamities
 hungary from the battle warn in to the
battle mohacz in in both which this generous
nation had unsuccessfully achieved prodigies valour and
even by their defeats had protracted the date their own
independence and cooperated for the defence the population
and arts europe against a barbarous and blooddelighting
foe my thoughts dwelt with rapturous admiration
upon the exploits the heroic huniades and his
greater son in the course my manycoloured experience
travels st leon 
i had seen something war and was not totally unacquainted
with its neverfailing consequences meditating as
i had done in the dungeons the inquisition if ever i recovered
my personal liberty and my freedom action a
journey into hungary my imagination had grown familiar
with captured towns and smoking villages with the gallant
soldier stretched lifeless on the plain and the defenceless
mother and her offspring brutally insulted and massacred 
with fields laid waste and a people lifting up their hands
for bread determined as i was to open at once all the
stores my wealth i thought i could not find a nobler
scene for its display i resolved to pour the entire stream
 my riches like a mighty river to fertilise these wasted
plains and revive their fainting inhabitants thus proceeding
should i not have a right to expect to find myself
guarded by the faithful love a people who would be indebted
to my beneficence for every breath they drew
this was the proper scene in which for the possessor the
philosopher's stone to take up his abode he who could
feel his ambition satisfied in a more straitened field would
by so doing prove himself unworthy the mighty blessing

nothing occurred to me in my journey importance
enough to obtain a place in this history when i arrived
i found the condition the inhabitants even more wretched
than the lawlessness my imagination had represented it
in the battle mohacz the last the line their native
sovereigns together with the flower his nobility had
fallen a victim to the merciless plague war what survived
 eminent persons in the state assembled soon after in
national diet and elected as they had been accustomed todo
one the most illustrious among themselves to preside
over the councils and to conduct the battles their country
but the princes the house austria ever on the
watch for the aggrandisement their family seized the
opportunity their disastrous situation to enslave the
hungarians to their sceptre charles the fifth caused his
brother ferdinand whose consort was only sister to the
deceased monarch to advance his claim to the vacant throne
and to enter the country with an imperial army the 
travels st leon
time and elected sovereign found himself in the weakened
condition his realm unable to resist the austrian arms
and was finally driven to the desperate expedient calling
in the turk to his assistance from this time for now
upwards thirty years the kingdom had been a prey to
two foreign invaders alternately taking and retaking her
most considerable towns and distributing with the strictest
impartiality the miseries war to her devoted inhabitants
solyman the magnificent the present ottoman emperor in
no long time threw off the mask and like his rival ferdinand
professed to fight only for the enlargement his
own dominions while the claims the liberties the constitution
and the prosperity hungary were alike trodden
under foot in the protracted and sanguinary struggle
at the period at which i entered this unfortunate realm
the turk was in possession buda grand temeswar and
many the most considerable cities and ferdinand who
had now succeeded charles in the imperial dignity had
been obliged to withdraw the seat the national government
from the first these towns the ancient metropolis
to the comparatively insignificant city presburg the
war between the two parties had more than once been interrupted
 not indeed by the more stable accommodations a
treaty peace but by a truce variously concluded for the
terms six or eight years short as was the period
assigned to the suspension arms it was never suffered to
reach its natural termination but after the interval one
or two summers hostilities did not fail to break out again
with aggravated symptoms resentment and animosity
the warfare that was now carried on had more in it passion
than vigour it was little moment to the interest 
either the princes under whose banners it was conducted 
but it was not on that account the less but rather the more
vexatious and distressing to the hungarian people it
obeyed no rule it operated in every direction no place
no province no town neither the church nor the palace
neither the cottage nor the castle could assure safety to
those who sought its protection a flying party which was
today in the west would almost the next day make its
appearance in the eastern extremity the kingdom arts
travels op st leon 
were neglected civilisation was destroyed the stern and
haughty baron free from restraint would sally from his
castle sometimes in pursuit plunder sometimes private
resentment and revenge the starving peasantry gladly
enlisted in the band a ferocious partisan for bread the
gangs robbers which the vigilant policy better times
had almost annihilated rose again in importance and
swelled into regiments and while they assumed at pleasure
the denomination adherents to ferdinand or to solyman
perpetrated every species excess with impunity
when a reflecting spectator surveys a country in a condition
like this he is tempted to wonder that the inhabitants still
retain the courage to bestow on their fields any sort cultivation
and that the licensed or the unlicensed robber still
finds something over which to extend the fangs his
rapacity
i had not long passed the gates vienna before i began
to observe the symptoms that which i had come
from the pyrenees and the garonne to visit the farther
 advanced the more melancholy was the scene i beheld
the country in some places entirely deserted villages laid
in ashes cities reduced to the dimensions and insignificance
 villages fields fertilised or made rank with the
manure human blood the roads broken up the erections
 human ingenuity almost obliterated mills thrown
down rivers choked up and rendered stagnant a few
solitary plots cultivation scattered amidst the mighty
waste the inhabitants i saw appeared terrified sickly
dejected and despairing there was scarcely one who earlier
or later had not lost a father or a brother whose wife had
not been made the victim brutal lust or who had not
seen his children butchered before his face persons 
the more opulent classes could not travel the country in
safety without being armed and associated in companies
and caravans i was myself obliged to obtain the protection
 parties soldiers who from time to time happened
to be marching in the route i pursued the savage neglect
into which every thing was declining produced in
repeated instances a contagious air and pestilential diseases 
while dearth and famine unrelentingly haunted the steps
bb 
 travels st leon
 those whom the sword and the pestilence had spared
such is war such are the evils nations willingly plunge
into or are compelled to endure to pamper the senseless
luxury or pride a ferdinand and a solyman 
i proceeded as i had originally determined to do to
buda the metropolis the kingdom it was in the hands
 the turk it was little importance to me whether
the monarch the soil were a mahometan or a christian 
my mind was engrossed by considerations a very different
magnitude i came to relieve and assist to the utmost
 my power the inhabitants the country in the extremity
 their distress
i had not proceeded thus far without bestowing a certain
strictness reflection on the subject i easily saw that
if i would confer a substantial benefit on this unfortunate
nation i had scarcely any other means for the purpose
than that reviving among them a spirit industry i
was aware that in the strictness the term money was
not wealth that it could be neither eaten nor drunk that
it would not itself either clothe the naked or shelter the
houseless and that it was unable but by a circuitous
operation to increase the quantity provisions or commodities
that the country afforded it was my business
therefore not to proceed idly in the distribution gold
but to meditate seriously my plan operations
i fixed myself in a spacious and beautiful mansion in
the capital this in the present distressed and depopulated
condition hungary it was not difficult to procure
the house i selected had for centuries been the principal
residence the illustrious family ragotski but the
present representative that family after having seen his
sons one after another killed in the battles his country
and his estates ruined by military depredation had found
himself compelled to fly in his old age and had taken refuge
with a distant branch the same house in the great
duchy lithuania it was not necessary for me to
proceed to any great extent in the first instance in the manufacture
 my wealth i had every facility for adding
to my store from time to time as circumstances should
demand
travels st leon 
i determined to open my operations with the article 
building there was sufficient need it one half 
the houses through most the districts lower or
western hungary in particular were ruined and untenantable
i did not begin with erecting palaces i felt that
the firstjfclaimants in the present emergency were the peasant
and the cultivator i was more desirous that the
rustic than the prince should be well lodged and accommodated
provided with the means rest after fatigue
and secured against the invasion ungenial seasons
my reasons for beginning with building were these it
was my purpose to stimulate and revive the industry the
nation i was desirous doing this with the least practicable
violence upon the inclinations and freedom the inhabitants
had i required those to whom i addressed
myself that they should fertilise the earth the seeds with
which it should be impregnated might be wanting i should
have a nice balance to adjust between what was necessary
for immediate subsistence and what might be applied as
the basis future a point better left to its spontaneous
level i might be impeded and controlled by a thousand
circumstances and at every step but the materials 
building are to be found in every country no seasons can
impair no malignity man can annihilate them whereever
there are quarries there is stone wherever there is
clay there are the means manufacturing bricks i was
anxious to leave the rest the great process human
accommodation to its course while i employed labourers
and paid them their wages there would be in the mildest
and most salutary mode a continual influx money into
the market the increase the precious metals would
give new alacrity to the operations traffic the buyers
would come forward with double confidence the venders
would be eager to meet the activity and spirit the demand
ardour and hope would revisit the human mind 
and the industry i created and the accommodations one
kind at least to which i gave birth would inoculate the
other departments the community with a similar industry
i came into hungary in the spring ' the
bb 
 travels st leon
season was favourable to seeding and cultivation i seemed
to enter on my undertaking with the happiest auspices
some time however must necessarily elapse between the
period impregnating the soil and that the future harvest
though i laid it down therefore as a law to myself
to commit the least practicable violence upon the genuine
action human society in pursuit the means subsistence
i thought proper in a certain degree to engage in
the importation corn from poland silesia and other
neighbouring countries this seemed an eligible measure
if it were only that i might show others the way and excite
them by my example i procured agents i extended
my concerns in various directions over the navigable rivers 
i formed magazines it would have been contrary to the
genius my undertaking either to make a gratuitous distribution
 what i purchased or to sell it at such low
prices as to drive other speculators whose spirit enterprise
might happily cooperate with mine out the market
however indifferent i might feel to the receipt 
pecuniary compensation it was necessary that in the concerns
 barter and trade i should assume the exterior 
a merchant
nor did i wholly confine my exertions within the occupations
 an architect and a corndealer these or
rather the former the two i regarded as my true and
genuine province but i did not so far enslave myself to
my own maxims as to negative in all instances the direct
demands want i was not anxious to convert a nation
or an army men into my personal adherents and retainers
 i was rather desirous to avoid this as a dangerous
source obloquy i did not therefore always decline by
pretended loans to assist other men to employ labourers as
well as myself to act upon their own designs and prosecute
their own fortune the cries the poor man the widow
and the orphan were sometimes too importunate and too
well justified by their unquestionable necessities to allow
me to withhold from them my alms in a few instances
i conveyed my supplies anonymously to persons whose
dignity birth or whose proud independence would have
been too grievously wounded if they had known their betravels
 st leon 
benefactor i was cautious and apprehensive as to the direct
dispensing money but not entirely bent against it i
regarded it as a precarious but in some cases a necessary
interference
the impulse which by these various measures i was
fortunate enough to generate seemed to have the effect sofar
at least as the sphere my activity extended to revive
the almost expiring life the country dejection and
hopeless indolence when i commenced my operations were
written in every face the miserable inhabitants crawled
along the roads or the street their hands idly relaxed by
their side and their slow and painful steps scarcely supporting
their lifeless trunk when my plan became known
and i had already in a few instances reduced my maxims
into practice it was as if the mellow and spiritstirring
blast a trumpet had wakened their sleeping souls their
eyes lightened with intelligence the tear anguish was
wiped from their faded cheeks j the smile hope slowly
expelled and faintly succeeded to the bitter expression 
despair busy and active thoughts gave new motion to
their limbs and quickness to their steps j the labourer was
seen hastening from place to place the sound the hammer
the saw and the various tools the workman was
to be heard from every side
the conduct i pursued necessarily fixed upon me a considerable
portion public attention i was a foreigner
destitute connections and having no previous acquaintance
with any individual in the country i was in appearance
a mere boy a young man in all the flower and
bloom adolescence and who must be supposed to have
just entered into possession his patrimony these things
tended to increase the public wonder and to render the
mystery my proceedings more perplexing and obscure
in the age genial warmth and melting softness i did
not appear accessible to those passions which haunt the
days and too often undermine the virtues youth youth
is the season benevolence j but benevolence is rarely as
seemed to be my case the only fruit that youth is found
to produce there was a maturity and a justness adaptation
in my plans not less foreign from what those who
bb 
travels op st leon
surrounded me would have expected me to display the
apparent disinterestedness and modesty my proceedings
were not lost upon the spectators the consequence all
this was that the sieur de chatillon such was the name i
at this time assumed was regarded as a phenomenon which
could not be too much admired or too loudly extolled
wherever i appeared the people followed me with their
gratitude and blessings ballads were written in my praise 
the very children were taught with their infant tongues to
lisp the virtues the saviour hungary my doors
were besieged my steps were watched i could move nowhere
without public observation i was importuned with
petitions without yet if any petitioner showed himself
presumptuous and intrusive the whole multitude 
bystanders was ready to repress his indiscretion and teach
him the respect that was due to their generous benefactor
who never refused any thing but what it would be improper
and injurious to grant
such was the treatment i experienced in buda and the
neighbouring districts whether i looked within or without
i was equally presented with incitements to selfapprobation
i sent forth labour accompanied with her best
and loveliest companions plenty and health congratulation
and contentment to scatter blessings through the land i
felt that i was prompted to this conduct by none the
motives vulgar ambition i desired neither lordships
nor estates neither elevation rank nor extension prerogative
sufficient to myself if i effected the happiness
 the people and they confessed me their benefactor my
every passion would then be gratified the utmost boundary
 my personal wishes proceeded no farther than this
that i might be honoured and loved what i desired i
obtained the youth i had procured to myself through the
medium the opus magnum was like what we are told
 the youth job when i went out through the
gate the city the young men saw me and hid themselves
and the aged arose and stood up the nobles refrained from
talking and the princes laid their hands upon their mouths
when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when
the eye saw me it gave witness to my actions
travels op st leon 
here it may be thought i had ascended to that sphere
which it was fit the possessor the philosopher's stone
should fill and reaped the rewards to which a man thus
endowed ought to be forward to entitle himself nor will
i affirm that i was insensible to the gratifications my
present situation though i sought to escape from the
applause that pursued me yet there is something in the
nature the human mind that makes it impossible for us
to hear it without complacence it was not however a
boisterous and obtrusive acclamation that satisfied me a
certain inwrought modesty nature made me listen to
noisy commendations with a sentiment shame they
seemed to be more than any thing i had done could deserve
 or they seemed to be in a tone from which the
delicacy a virtuous mind shrinks back displeased they
were so obstreperous as to take from me the power 
hearing the sweeter verdict my own conscience no
it was the unbidden tear that glistened in the eye my
beneficiaries the tongue that faltered beneath the essays
 gratitude the overwhelmed heart that had no power to
express itself the hand the parent that was stretched
out to his children and dumbly said these these shall
thank you it was these things that i felt within as the
balsam my life and the ambrosia heaven
chapter xxxvi
yet thus surrounded and regaled with this animated
praise i was not content i wanted a friend i was alone
amidst the innumerable multitudes those i had blessed
i knew no cordiality i could repose no confidence i
could find no equal i was like a god who dispenses his
bounties profusely through twenty climates but who at the
same time sits separate elevated and alone in the highest
heaven the reader may if he pleases despise me for the
confession but i felt that i was not formed for the happiness
 a god
i was not however long sufficiently at leisure thus to
travels st leon
refine upon the deficiencies my situation i had engaged
in a task extreme delicacy in which the smallest failure
would draw along with it the most serious consequences
mine was not an undertaking that had for its object to
supply those around me with luxuries or to augment the
stock their cheerful relaxations and amusements the
very existence my beneficiaries depended on its success
i had put myself in a considerable degree with whatever
diffidence and caution in the room the course nature
and had taken the administration the common benefits
 human society into my hands the populace are ever
ready to construe this delegation in the strictest sense
unqualified to trace the wheels and combinations the
great machine if prosperity is their lot they willingly ascribe
it to their protectors and governors and if they
are unfortunate it is against them that the storm their
resentment is directed the moment they are thus irritated
their impatience is too great to admit correctives
and remedies in the fury their disappointment they
disturb every thing and render that irreparable and fatal
which was at first only doubtful and unpromising
my proceedings as i have already said bore in the commencement
the most benignant face and seemed a revival
 this despairing and unfortunate nation little less than
miraculous the regular labours in which the inhabitants
became engaged restored a healthful tone to their minds 
the payments they duly received seemed to discharge them
from all anxious solicitude and as by my own efforts and
the enterprises others the market was supplied with provisions
they had no difficulty in exchanging these payments
for the necessaries life the supply the market at
first was easy the universal dejection that preceded though
it had not prevented all exertions for that purpose had
rendered those exertions too feeble for extensive success
the strenuous efforts that were now made were productive
 a copious supply but they rendered each importation
more difficult than the importation before the demand
continued the same the relief was every day more diminutive
and precarious the harvest was however advancing
with the happiest auspices and though some time must
travels st leon 
yet be consumed in expectation it was probable frugality
and fortitude might enable the inhabitants to hold out till
the season plenty should arrive
but fortitude is not the virtue a populace the
higher had been their hopes and the more unexpected their
deliverance with so much the more blank and melancholy
a countenance they beheld this unexpected delay and retrogression
not understanding the powers by which i acted
they blindly ascribed to me the faculty doing whatever i
pleased as long as every thing went on prosperously
they were grateful the moment a reverse occurred they
were inclined to murmur they made no allowance for the
limited capacities a human creature they imputed
whatever was unpleasing to indifference or ill will the
price commodities after having for a while become
moderate now rapidly rose again this was partly the consequence
 the increased quantity the precious metals
by means which any assignable sum bore a less proportion
to the provisions the market than it had done
before bread was at a very high price and it occasionally
happened to buyers who did not come early enough
that there was no bread to be purchased the doors the
houses where it was sold were besieged the industrious
poor appeared before them with the first faint dawn the
morning's light here they consumed hours painful
expectation in grievous addition to the hours their customary
fatigue the whole was a scene anguish and
calamity the passions those who composed it mingled
with the distress and rendered it too heavy to be borne
anticipating famine they felt the mischiefs it before
it arrived never was the demand so urgent it seemed as
if the capacity men's appetites was enlarged and the
cravings hunger became more insatiable in proportion to
the smallness the supply to people thus circumstanced
it would have been vain to recommend frugality and moderation
they devoured the food with their eyes while
it was yet beyond the reach their hands and the lesson
you read them would have sounded in their ears as if you
had bid them die today to escape the danger dying tomorrow

travels st leon
the crowds which the necessity purchasing bread
brought together at certain hours when assembled naturally
entered into the discussion their present discontents
they were not satisfied with the discourse and jostling 
the morning the habits produced by these noisy assemblies
had a secret charm with them and drew them together at
seasons less urgent demand they parole the streets 
they were loud in the expressions their dissatisfaction
with the inconsequence incident to the lower orders 
mankind they threatened to destroy the mills the markets
the places sale the means and materials by which their
wants were to be supplied
in the midst these scenes tumult and confusion it
is not to be imagined that i escaped uncensured far
otherwise in proportion to the gratitude and adoration
with which they had lately regarded me were their detestation
and abhorrence now my interference was spoken
 with contempt and execration for what purpose had
i a foreigner come into their country and intruded myself
into their affairs why had i impiously taken them out
 the hands their heavenly father whose care was so
constant and whose relief so certain it was on my part a
despicable vanity and presumption which the justice 
providence could not fail to avenge and they must now
suffer the punishment my blasphemy but they did not
stop here there was no horrible calumny which they did
not invent or give credit to against me they imputed tome
the basest personal motives for what i had done under
the hypocritical pretence they cried being their benefactor
and saviour i was using them only for my private ends
i had become a purchaser and vender corn for the single
purpose increasing my fortune the present scarcity
they were well assured was artificial and my own contriving
i had magazines in different stations on the borders
which when the price was risen to the standard my
avarice and when half the people had fallen victims to my
inhumanity i purposed to dispose to an immense profit
such were the aspersions to which my character became
generally exposed by the populace who now experienced
the unsatisfied cravings hunger and in whom my protravels
 st leon 
meetings had excited hope only to he followed hy a more
cruel disappointment they were greedily credited many
who knew their falsehood were yet zealous to propagate
them short as had been my residence in hungary i had
made many enemies it is to he feared that no man can
be assiduous and indefatigable in the service others
without incurring that consequence i employed a great
number workmen every one whom for whatever reason
i refused to employ every one who being unqualified for
the service i required looked with an envious eye on the
better fortune his neighbour was well disposed to be my
enemy persons no contemptible account in the community
had been excited by expectations profit to
engage in the importation corn these persons viewed
my efforts in the same department with a suspicious eye
and regarded a man who however cautious in his proceedings
was not regulated by the same motive as a most pernicious
rival my sudden elevation and importance in the
country were viewed with not more astonishment than
aversion by those whose importance i obscured they could
not hear with patience an upstart a boy a stranger
one universally unknown elbowing out the influence 
all that was most illustrious and venerable in the community
and robbing them daily their adherents and
retainers all these persons left no effort untried to defame
my character
the impulse once given the turbulent disposition the
populace became every day more formidable it is much
easier to disseminate a temper this sort than to quell it 
my opulent foes might take alarm at its excesses and desire
to undo what they had done but it was beyond their
power every day i feared lest from threats and invectives
the populace should proceed to violence every night
i thought i had reason to congratulate myself that the day
had passed without waste and spoil committed by them on
the means their subsistence or was not marked with the
destruction their champion and benefactor in some
places a sort petty sedition broke out among the labourers
i employed in the morning they refused to work why
should a man work they muttered when after all he may
travels st leon
starve with the wages his labour in his possession at
night they became impatient and furious and demanded
from my superintendents and storehousemen the food
which in the morning they had refused to earn and were
therefore now unable to purchase i had already had some
experience in the nature popular tumults had now no
marchese filosanto at hand to persuade me their inefficacy
 and if i had i should no longer have lent an ear
to his serene and unsuspicious generosity i felt the reality
 the danger i saw the storm as it blackened in my horizon
and was deeply convinced what it would be if it burst
upon my head
it may be imagined with what feelings i viewed my
whole design on the point to be subverted by the unruliness
 those for whose benefit it had been planned it is true
i had now no darling relations to be involved in my fate
no incomparable wife no daughters illustrious in innocence
and beauty yet my feelings were scarcely less pungent
than they had been at the period my catastrophe at pisa
i had blamed myself in review that in my experiments at
constance at dresden at pisa and at madrid i had not
commenced upon a sufficiently ample scale but had suffered
myself to be frustrated by the ingloriousness my precautions
that had not been my error in the present
instance yet my success now promised to be scarcely more
flattering than upon former occasions i had looked for
happiness as the result the benevolence and philanthropy
i was exerting i found only anxiety and a well grounded
fear even for my personal safety let no man build on the
expected gratitude those he spends his strength to serve 
let him be beneficent if he will but let him not depend
for his happiness on the conviction his rectitude and
virtue that is to be impressed on the minds others 
there is a principle in the human breast that easily induces
them to regard every thing that can be done for them
as no more than their due and speedily discharges them
from the oppressive consciousness obligation there is
a levity in the generality men that entails on them a
continual oblivion past benefits and makes one recent
disappointment more importance in their eyes than an
travels st leon 
i
eternity kindnesses and condescension i shall have
other instances ingratitude to display in what yet remains
to be related my story
my nights were restless my thoughts were in arms
what was it that it became me to do in the present emergency
 sometimes in the bitterness my heart hating
myself hating the endowments the stranger hating a
race beings who denied all credit to the most unheardof
exertions for their advantage i determined to withdraw
unobserved from my attendants and clients and bid adieu
to hungary for ever but whither was i to fly what
was i to do next what experiment could i make the
purposes to which to apply the philosopher's stone that i
had not already made these questions to none which
i could give a satisfactory answer checked the career my
passion and gave pause to my thoughts
whatever i did i was determined to do nothing rashly
nor to quit a great experiment without its having been fully
tried it was no light concern no trivial child'splay in
which i had embarked i had taken the welfare perhaps
the existence a great and heroic nation under my protection
in this glorious vocation it did not become me to
be lightly discouraged what if those i served and saved
did not show themselves sufficiently sensible to the exertions
i made for them i ought to purify my bosom on an
occasion like this from base and ignoble motives and to
deem myself sufficiently recompensed by my conscious virtue
what if the service in which i had engaged now
appeared to be a service hazard and peril is there
any great undertaking that can be separated from this condition
 if hastily from cowardice from pique or from
any other motive i deserted the business on which i had
entered what was to become my mistaken indeed butin
that case most unfortunate clients the greater was
the crisis to which they were exposed the more were unremitted
vigilance and uncommon powers necessary to guide
them amidst its rocks and its quicksands i saw thousands
 men who for several weeks had fed as it were from the
stores my bounty by a propensity inseparable from the
human heart i became attached to the work my media
travels op st leon
nations and the labour my thoughts all their fickleness
their injustice even the atrocious calumnies they admitted
and propagated against me could not wean my
attachment from beings a great portion whom but for
my interference would i believed long ere this have expired
 hunger
in the peculiar and urgent circumstances in which i
found myself no expedient was so obvious as that calling
in the interference the government under which i lived
jt was necessary that the resources national subsistence
should be defended from the wanton spoil those who
when they were annihilated must inevitably perish it
was necessary that the benefactor hungary who i flattered
myself was still able to watch effectively for her
advantage should be protected from her misguided resentment
the alternative was singularly painful to my feelings
the pride with which my unparalleled endowments inspired
me was deeply wounded when i was compelled to confess
that i was not alone equal to the task i had undertaken
and that i must submit to call in a foreign auxiliary i
augured little favourable from the interference government
which if i implored i could scarcely expect to
guide which was not likely to submit to my principle 
rendering its interference the mildest and smallest that the
nature the case would admit but puffed up with presumption
and intoxicated with authority would probably
leave no concern the public welfare uninvited least
 all could i anticipate much good from a turkish government
but what could i do i could discover no
other expedient influenced by the views i have recited
i had hitherto kept myself as far from the observation 
the political directors the state as i could but my
cautiousness and reserve were now at an with my
eyes open i exposed myself to all the evils that might attend
on my proceeding
i determined to apply to the bashaw the province
previously to my taking this step i had the precaution to
enquire his character he was the genuine offspring the
turkish system government his name was muzaffer
bey he was originally a circassian slave then a janistravels
 st leon 
say and rising by insensible gradation had at length been
appointed bashaw buda which as being the immediate
frontier between austria and the porte was at this time
the most arduous situation in the gift the sultan he
was esteemed a good soldier he had been early distinguished
by his dexterity in military exercises he had since
seen much service j and in every situation in which he was
placed had earned commendation and honour he was
abstemious and hardy for himself he neither pampered
his appetites nor shrunk from severity and he had as little
indulgence for those under his command as for his own person
yet he was indebted for his present eminence more to
the arts the courtier than to his merits in the field his
chief care had ever been to recommend himself to those
above him and to obtain the good will his equals for
the opinion his inferiors he gave himself little concern
with considerable ability he laboured under no check from
either principle or ingenuous pride and therefore was
extremely successful in his attacks on the inclination 
those he sought the habits his mind had modified the
lines his countenance and the tones his voice except
to his dependants and the poor he almost always spoke with
a smile upon his face and his enunciation was silvertongued
oily copious and insinuating if he ever adopted
a different manner the variation was only in the means
not the and when he seemed to travel by an opposite
road the goal at which he aimed was the same he never
consulted any oracle but that his apparent interest if he
had any insolence in his nature he regarded his slaves and
those under his military command as affording a sufficient
sphere for its exercise he had no affections to disturb him
from his bent he had no passions but the selfcomplacency
 superior cunning and the sordid love pelf
this account the man with whom i had to deal was
far from encouraging but i had no alternative i sent to
signify my desire to confer with him or to speak more
accurately to ask in the eastern manner when it would be
agreeable to him to receive a present which i requested
his acceptance he appointed the morning the following
clay i prepared a gift such as might tend to conciliate his
c c
 travels st leon
favour without marking in the donor the possession 
immoderate wealth it consisted silks and muslins with
a small piece plate exquisite workmanship my
present was borne by two my servants we were
ushered to the bashaw in his private apartment there were
two or three persons in attendance upon him they examined
my present together and without condescending
to express much approbation i could nevertheless discern
that the bashaw was pleased with it this ceremony concluded
muzaffer ordered what i had brought to be taken
into a different apartment and every other person withdrawing
we were left alone
while the bashaw was examining my gift i took the
opportunity considering his person he appeared to be
about sixty years age his complexion dark and muddy
his features coarse and distorted his mustachios remarkably
large his person though bony and muscular considerably
below the middle size and his figure ungainly and
ungraceful i felt surprised that such a man should ever
have been an excellent soldier or have risen from a low
rank to one the first situations the empire to look
at him he seemed better formed for the vice a comedy
than the ruler a nation he raised his eyes towards me
askance as he sat leaning on his elbow and said
you cal yourself 
the sieur de chatillon
 and your age 
 is two and twenty
te i am glad you are come to me i intended to have
sent for you and you have saved me the trouble
i made many apologies for my intrusion but added
that i had a petition to prefer and hoped he would favour
me with a hearing
not at all not at all do not call it an intrusion it
is necessary i should be acquainted with you he proceeded

you have undertaken to confer great benefits on the
subjects the grand signior my master to rescue them
from famine young rich a stranger unknown to my
master unknown to his subjects i understand that you
travels op st leon 
have spared no labour or expense to bring about their welfare
this is really a very extraordinary case your merit
is unprecedented i do not feel myself competent to reward
it
i answered that i laid no claim to uncommon merit 
that every temper had its particular gratifications and that
i found as real a luxury in the proceedings he had remarked
as other men did in the excesses the table or
the promiscuous enjoyments the harem
it is out my power continued he to remunerate
you as you deserve i must send you to constantinople
i perceived that this was the first essay his artifice
i informed him which i have no doubt he knew well enough
before that i had no desire to go to constantinople i
wished to remain where i was and to finish what i had
begun
what you have not done then suddenly and with
an abrupt voice exclaimed the bashaw by mahomet a
man a reasonable appetite in your place might be satisfied
have not you filled the streets with riots and the
country with rebellion do not the populace assemble in
crowds insulting every one they meet and talking nothing
but fire and devastation the bowstring and the
diameter be so good my dear sir as to inform me what
further you may have in view 
reverend bashaw cried i with submission yet with
firmness i have none these things in view but a
moment ago you did justice to my intentions they are
those beneficence and beneficence only
i know nothing about that i have nothing to do
with honest men's blunders i look to the effects they produce

these effects most mighty sir are temporary they
are the clouds that will often obscure for an instant the
brightest sunshine condescend to lend me your generous
assistance and all will be well
do not tell me clouds and sunshine this is to
my thinking not an april shower but an earthquake and
a hurricane if we are all to be swallowed up or whirled
into the air it is no consolation to me that the day after
c c 
 travels st leon
we are gone every thing shall be as fair and serene as
paradise itself
remember sir that when i came into hungary i
found its inhabitants in the most desperate condition miserable
wasted and starving have i not already suspended
this evil for months 
yes i do remember you are one those busybodies
who never see an evil without imagining they are
the persons to correct it intruding into every thing and
subverting every thing the superintendence the public
welfare is a mystery to which none are competent but those
whom mahomet has raised to the situation statesmen
your interference is blasphemy against the spirit our
religion and deserves to be encountered with the most
exemplary punishment
 good god then is it in this country a crime to feed
the hungry to clothe the naked and shelter the houseless

sieur de chatillon retorted the bashaw you appear
to be unacquainted with the maxims turkish policy the
wisest and most beneficent in the world if none the
disturbances had happened at which i have so much reason
to be alarmed still in relieving the people in the manner
you have done you have incurred the guilt high treason
against the sultan know sir that through the whole
extent his dominions there is but one proprietor
and that is our illustrious monarch you say that you
wish to be the benefactor his subjects and the judge 
your own proceedings such sentiments are direct rebellion
against the glorious constitution ottoman the sovereign
 constantinople will have no benefactor in the
countries he presides over but himself like the invisible
ruler the universe he acts by second causes he allows
his ministers to be the instruments his beneficence but
all must be ascribed to him must flow from his will and
be placed under his control you who have formed a plan
 public benefit without consulting him and have presumed
like a luminary the world to move in an orbit
 your own have in strictness construction forfeited your
life to his justice and i consult rather the clemency his
travels op st leon 
nature than the maxims his policy if i suffer you to go
from this palace with your head upon your shoulders
without permitting myself to be too much moved by the
imperious language addressed to me i complained to the
bashaw the rigorous and arbitrary character what he
stated to be the maxims the turkish government i
solemnly protested that i had no private or personal object
in view the effect my operations would be to give
new strength and energy to his master's dominions by
diffusing happiness among his subjects by reviving industry
and scattering plenty prosperity and ease all disaffection
would be rooted out and the people who are never
minute in scanning the cause their enjoyments would
bless the sceptre under which they were made to participate
such manifold benefits if the policy the divan led them
in any degree to interfere they ought rather to crown my
measures with their applause than wantonly to throw obstacles
in the way what i purposed i asked however
no reward i demanded no favour for myself all i desired
was that the sultan would assist me in securing to his people
those benefits the dissemination which i had so
auspiciously begun
the bashaw without taking any direct notice this
expostulation answered that i was not aware the maxims
 his government to which inconsideration my seeming
generosity and rectitude he was willing to give the mildest
interpretation it is however continued he to the
last degree idle in you to imagine that you can be permitted
to go on unobserved and that the sultan and his representatives
are to take no account your proceeding the great
instrument for ruling mankind is by their passions and
their opinions the man from whom they believe they
have the most to fear and the most to hope will always be
their master whatever be your secret or your professed
designs you go on from day to day making yourself partisans
and enlisting the subjects the sultan among your
personal retainers what security has he for your submission
and loyalty how shall he know that when you
h ave acquired the advantages a powerful leader you will
n ot go over to the enemy or in the present distracted conc
c 
travels st leon
edition the province even have the audacity to set up for
yourself if therefore by an unexampled clemency 
construction i decline to reduce you into the passive machine
 my master's will it is at least incumbent on me
that i should take account your powers and possess myself
 the schedule your property by this means only
can i watch your progress and take care that you do not
suddenly become too powerful for a subject are you prepared
to satisfy me on this head 
on this question i hesitated for a moment i had not
exactly anticipated the enquiry at length i requested the
delay a few days and then i promised that all his demands
should be satisfied the bashaw resumed 
sieur de chatillon i remark your hesitation and i
draw from it no favourable augury these indirect and
involuntary indications are more worthy my attention
than all the studied and elaborate information you shall
think proper to give me sir you are a man darkness
and every thing that relates to you is enveloped in mystery
you come hither with no apparent motive you have no
connections blood in hungary you have no acquaintance
with any eminent person the hungarian nation i
have had my spies on you though i have not hitherto
thought proper to summon you to my presence you have
purchased no property in the province i cannot learn that
you have any correspondences or resources from abroad i
have been at the pains to procure an account your expenditure
during the three months you have resided among
us much that expenditure has been obscure clandestine
and indirect but i believe you will find my estimate
which you are at liberty to inspect and remark upon tolerably
correct your disbursements for three months
exceed the amount two years income the richest subject
that even the credulous monarchs christendom suffer
within their dominions what am i to think this how
can i be sufficiently vigilant respecting a man whose expenditure
is immense and whose wealth can neither be
traced to its source nor ascertained in its amount 
i was not slow in conjecturing the result which the
bashaw proposed to himself from our present conference i
travels st leon 
was confirmed in my conjecture by the circumstance his
choosing that the discussion between us should be apart
from all witnesses he regarded me as a boy and had
therefore practised upon me all those arts which might
most effectually excite in me fear and alarm he found
however that under the external indications youth and
inexperience i possessed the wariness that added years most
powerfully inculcate and the selfpossession a mind thoroughly
awake to its situation and its resources thrust
have been to the minister before whom i stood a
memorable phenomenon but curiosity is not a turkish
passion and the single object the bashaw in the present
instance was to make the mysteriousness my circumstances
a pretext for extorting money i submitted with
as little seeming reluctance as possible to the necessity 
the case i requested the good offices muzaffer to protect
my benefactions and begged permission to make him
the compliment a handsome sum money by way 
convincing him that i was worthy his friendship
this business was easily adjusted between us i found
him perfectly skilled in the duties a public office and
by no means under the dominion visionary scruples he
told me he was now convinced that i was a well meaning
man and a good subject he said that nothing could tend
more effectually to demonstrate my innocence than my
showing that i understood the duties and concerns a
minister state and that for his own part he was never
so happy as when he was thus able to reconcile his private
interests with the good and faithful service his master
there was nothing that demanded a more unremitted vigilance
or a more skilful management than such a situation
as his and it would be most unreasonable either in the
sovereign that appointed him or the subjects over whom he
was placed to expect him to be indifferent to the emoluments
and perquisites his function he complimented
me warmly upon the disinterestedness and liberality my
exertions he thought himself particularly fortunate in
having so publicspirited an individual within the circuit
 his jurisdiction in fine he hoped he should be honoured
with my personal acquaintance and assured me that
c c 
 travels st leon
nothing could make him more happy than the frequent repetition
 my visits
we now perfectly understood one another and it was
apparent that i had to do with a man who for what he
deemed an adequate consideration would willingly lend me
the authority and countenance his office and suffer me
to guide him in any the functions i might conceive necessary
for the execution my projects guards were
agreed to be placed upon the magazines where corn was
still contained and from place to place on the banks 
the rivers where the depredations a misguided populace
were most to be apprehended finding the bashaw so
perfectly willing to comply with my requisitions i further
obtained from him the direction several squadrons 
cavalry for the protection the crops which from the consequences
 my interference now began on all sides to
variegate the scene this was a most important service
when the corn was first committed to the earth it was out
 the reach military devastation but as time glided
silently on the case became materially altered the enemy
might from forecast desire to reap the harvest what he
had not sown or from malice to destroy that without which
the turk would perhaps be unable to retain his newly acquired
territory this had in reality been the principal
cause before my arrival in hungary the very general
neglect into which agriculture had fallen muzaffer than
whom no person could now be more polite and condescending
allowed me to determine the number and nature the
troops i required and added that though he could not
openly put them under my direction the slightest intimation
i might think proper to convey to him should at anytime
decide their march and regulate their quarters
chapter xxxvii
in my conference with the bashaw i may seem to have
secured more than j one point material importance 
travels op st leon 
yet it was difficult for any man to be in a state less consolatory
or more full danger and menace than i was at
this moment by my vigilance and the power which thus
i had acquired i prevented indeed the inhabitants from
wantonly destroying the means their own subsistence 
but the more i was their benefactor the more i appeared
to become odious to their thoughts my negotiation with
the bashaw whatever other benefit might accrue from it
did not tend to increase the resources the country i was
obliged to witness many scenes wretchedness he that
would assist mankind in their adversity must harden his
heart to be the spectator the distress that he can and that
he cannot relieve but whatever i beheld this sort the
majority the bystanders obstinately persisted to ascribe
to my deliberate malignity the military aid i found myself
necessitated to introduce by no means tended to disarm
the prejudices my clients in one or two instances but
no more slight tumults arose and a few the rioters fella
prey to their own wickedness and folly these misfortunes
were cast as reproach upon me arid i was pursued
with clamours and curses i found it requisite to obtain a
guard for my person i was abhorred by those for whom
all my vigilance was exerted and insulted by the mouths
that i supplied with the necessaries existence
nor was this my only source alarm and uneasiness in
my present situation i was by no means a dupe to the
ostentatious civility the bashaw i perfectly understood
his insinuation when he invited the frequent repetition 
my visits i knew that however dearly i purchased his
friendship and patronage i should still have to purchase
them again and again his extortions upon me admitted
 no limits except from his own modesty or the estimate
he might form my invisible resources bribery itself
afforded me no complete security and now that i had become
an object curiosity and remark he had sufficiently
shown me i was at the mercy his caprice or that his
master for my liberty and even for my life
yet could i have resolved to quit hungary and seek
the protection some more regular government what benefit
should i derive from a removal mystery was the great
travels op st leon
and unconquerable bane my situation and from the poisonous
influence mystery the most regular system 
government was not competent to protect me it would be
idle to imagine that in any country on earth a stranger
would be permitted to launch into such expenses as those
in which i was engaged without becoming an object 
suspicion and being made liable to continual interruption
in his measures yet unless allowed to use the resources
i possessed what advantage was it to be the depository
 wealth without a bound was it to be wished for a
man under my circumstances to have a family or to be
without a family when i had one i found the legacy 
the stranger robbing me every comfort that sort with
the most calamitous aggravations when i was stripped
 wife and children though no man could prize those benefits
more dearly than i prized them i took to myself the
consolation that at least now i should risk no one's happiness
but my own and that for a person exercising my
endowments it was perhaps requisite to be free from every
shackle and incumbrance i found however the topic from
which i had consoled myself in reality the source a new
misfortune i had the wealth a nobleman but i was
deprived his adventitious attributes i had no illustrious
ancestry to boast i had neither lineage nor parent i had
neither wife nor children in whom mutually to reflect and
see reflected the devotedness and generosity my station
i had not even the ordinary advantage which is within the
reach almost every man connections and acquaintance
friends handed down to me as a branch my patrimonial
inheritance friends whose value experience enabled
me to ascertain and friends with whom long habits familiarity
had given birth to reciprocal endearment the
bashaw had imputed to me the design forming a party
alas these which are the great materials for cementing
party attachments were totally denied me i had no bonds
 alliance but those which money afforded the coarsest the
meanest the least flattering and the most brittle those
ligatures that afford the semblance uniting man with
man
travels st leon sq
chapter xxxviii
aware the difficulties which unavoidably sprung out 
the nature my situation i resolved immediately to endeavour
to supply them to the best my power i conceived
that there was no consideration so urgent upon meat
the present moment as that i should without loss 
time create to myself connections that might balance and
keep at bay the sallies arbitrary rule and that i should
weave with my own hand the cords friendship
i had no sooner formed this project than an individual
suggested himself to my reflections whom i judged to be
by a singular concurrence circumstances happily fitted
to be the subject my experiment and admirably qualified
to afford me protection in the most unfavourable events
the name this man was bethlem gabor he had been
some time before brought to me by one his friends and
he was a man whom for a thousand reasons it was impossible
to see and converse with without receiving the most
indelible impression he was the lineal representative 
one the most illustrious houses in hungary his vocation
like that the majority the hungarian nobility
had been arms but in the midst a fraternity all 
whom were warlike he stood conspicuous and alone his
courage though cool and deliberate almost mounted to a
degree desperate rashness and the fertility his invention
and the variety his stratagems did not fall short
 his courage the celerity his measures was equally
distinguished distance was no bar to him and he had
no sooner conceived a project however arduous than it was
executed he had formed under his own eye a band 
men like himself impetuous yet deliberate swift in execution
silent in march invincible to hardship contemners
 fatigue difficulties hunger and thirst when
introduced to me he was upwards fifty years age
he was more than six feet in stature and yet he was built
as if it had been a colossus destined to sustain the weight
 the starry heavens his voice was like thunder and he
 travels st leon
never uttered a word but it seemed to shake his manly chest
his head and chin were clothed with a thick and shaggy hair
in colour a dead black he had suffered considerable mutilation
in the services through which he had passed 
one his hands three fingers were gone the sight his
right eye was extinguished and the cheek half shot away
while the same explosion had burned his complexion into a
colour that was universally dun or black his nose was
scarred and his lips were thick and large bethlem gabor
though universally respected for the honour and magnanimity
 a soldier was not less remarkable for habits 
reserve and taciturnity but these habits misfortune had
caused to become more deeply ingrafted in his nature
during one his military excursions a party marauders
had in his absence surprised his castle burned it to the
ground and savagely murdered his wife and children
and every living creature within the walls the same
stroke that rendered him childless made him also a beggar
he had been regarded for his proceedings as an adherent
to the turkish standard but he had always tenaciously
maintained the most complete independence the adversity
that had now fallen upon him was too great he
would not become a pensioner the sultan despair had
taken fast possession his heart he disbanded the body
 men he had formed and wandered a solitary outcast
upon the face his country for some time he seemed to
have a savage complacence in conceiving that the evil he
had suffered was past all remedy and in spurning at those
palliations and disguises with which vulgar souls are
accustomed to assuage their woe yet the energy his
nature would not suffer him to rest he wandered an outcast
 but every day engendered some new thought or passion
 and it appeared probable that he would not yet quit
the stage existence till he had left behind him the remembrances
 a terrible and desolating revenge
it may seem strange that such a man as i have described
should be the indivi dual i selected out the whole
hungarian nation to make my friend it may seem that
his qualities were better adapted to repel than attract my
choice would not appear strange if the reader could have
travels st leon 
conversed with him as i did he was hideous to the sight
and he never addressed himself to speak that i did not
feel my very heart shudder within me seldom did he
allow himself to open his thoughts but when he did
great god what supernatural eloquence seemed to inspire
and enshroud him not that upon such occasions he was
copious and ciceronian but that every muscle and every
limb seemed to live and to quiver with the thoughts he
expressed the hearer could not refuse to venerate as
well as fear him i never pitied him bethlem gabor's
was a soul that soared to a sightless distance above the
sphere pity i can scarcely say i sympathised with him 
but when i listened to his complaints rather let me say
his invectives i was astonished overwhelmed and motionless
the secret the effects he thus produced lay
in his own way feeling the incidents he described look
at him when he sat alone wrapped in meditation you
would say that is a man iron though adversity pour
her fiercest darts upon him he is invulnerable he is 
too colossal a structure to be accessible to human feelings
and human affections listen to his narrative or rather
to the bursts passion which with him supplied the place
and performed the functions narrative you would soon
confess your mistake while he spoke he ceased to be a
man and became something more amazing when he alluded
to what he had endured you did not compassionate
him for you felt that he was a creature another nature 
but you confessed that never man seemed to have suffered
so much or to savour with such bitterness the cup woe
he did not love his wife or his children as any other man
would do he probably never dandled or fondled them his
love was speechless and disdaining the common modes 
exhibition it might sometimes be mistaken for indifference
but it brooded over and clung round his heart and when
it was disturbed when the strong ties domestic charity
were by the merciless hand war snapped asunder you
then saw its voluminous folds spread and convulsed before
you gigantic and immeasurable he cursed their murderers
 he cursed mankind he rose up in fierce defiance
 eternal providence and your blood curdled within you
s travels st leon
as he spoke such was bethlem gabor i could not help
admiring him his greatness excited my wonder and my
reverence and while his manners awed and overwhelmed
me i felt an inexplicable attachment to his person still increasing
in my bosom
on his part my kindness and partiality appeared scarcely
less pleasing to bethlem gabor than his character and
discourse were fascinating to me he had found himself
without a confident or a friend his wife and his children
in a certain degree understood him and though he had
an atmosphere repulsion beyond which no mortal ever
penetrated they came to the edge that and rested there 
they trembled involuntarily at his aspect but at the same
time they adored and they loved him the rest the
world viewed him from a more fearful distance respected
him but dared not even in fancy be familiar with him
when therefore he lost his family he lost his all he
roamed the earth in solitude and all men made room for
him as he passed i was the first who since the fatal
event that had made him childless and a beggar had
courted his society and invited his communications i
had dared to take the lion by the paw and seat myself
next him in his den there was a similarity in our fortunes
that secretly endeared him to me we had each by
the malice a hostile destiny though in a very different
manner been deprived our families we were each 
us alone fated each to be hereafter for ever alone we
blended ourselves the one with the other as perfectly as we
could often over our gloomy bowl we mingled groans
and sweetened our draught as we drank it with maledictions
in the school bethlem gabor i became acquainted
with the delights melancholy a melancholy
not that contracted but that swelled the soul a melancholy
that looked down upon the world with indignation
and that relieved its secret load with curses and execrations
we frequently continued whole nights in the participation
 these bitter joys and were surprised still at our serious
board by the light the morrow's sun
i have now i believe fully accounted for our intimacy
and displayed the ligatures that secretly bound us to each
travels st leon 
other it is scarcely necessary to add that ray understanding
confirmed what my heart impelled bethlem
gabor appeared to me the fittest man in the world upon
whom to fix for my friend we were qualified mutually
to benefit each other my kindness my unremitted attentions
the earnestness with which i listened to and
soothed his griefs mitigated their agony i proposed
when i could once more reconcile and incite him to activity
to repair his castle and restore his fortune on
the other hand he was all the persons i could have
pitched upon the ablest to protect me by his birth he
ranked among the first men his country by his ability
at least as a partisan soldier a character at that time highly
esteemed he rose above them all
for some time i regarded bethlem gabor as entirely
my friend and i consulted him in every thing in which
compatibly with the legacy the stranger the summerhouse
i could consult him i told him the suspicions 
the bashaw and the precariousness my safety i demanded
his advice as to the best method securing it
ought i to regard it as a more effectual or as a cheaper
expedient to attempt to purchase the countenance the
sultan instead condescending to bribe his minister 
ought i to set up for myself and by rendering myself the
independent prince one the hungarian provinces
defy the turk or at least endeavour to negotiate with him
from a more respectable and commanding situation i
said more than enough under these heads as it afterwards
appeared to awaken strange imaginations in a mind so
much penetration as that bethlem gabor in fine i
demanded him whether in case any great and formidable
danger falling on me he would to the utmost his
power afford me protection when the question was first
started he swore to me with his customary impressiveness
and energy that he would
while i was thus employed in consulting him and
opening to him as far as was practicable my prospects and
fears did not less succeed in dissipating or suspending
tie despair his melancholy it was benefit to him
in this respect that by opening to him my affairs i from
 travels st leon
time to time called off his attention from his personal misfortunes
i proposed to him the rebuilding his castle and
i at length obtained his permission to send off a corps 
workmen for that purpose beside the castle in which his
wife and children had been murdered and which the
marauders had nearly destroyed he had one considerably
stronger though void all recommendation from cheerfulness
or beauty in the more northerly part the kingdom
this we visited together i restored the condition
 his fields with considerable difficulty i replaced the
cattle he had lost by purchases in poland and i revived
his dilapidated revenues at first he felt an invincible
repugnance to the receiving any advantage from the bounty
 another but by continual remonstrances i was able to persuade
him that he owed me nothing and that what i did
was no more than was required from me by a regard for
my own safety
if ever on the face the earth there lived a misanthrope
bethlem gabor was the man never for a moment did he
forget or forgive the sanguinary catastrophe his family 
and for his own misfortunes he seemed to have vowed vengeance
against the whole human race he almost hated
the very face man and when expressions cheerfulness
peace and contentment discovered themselves in his
presence i could see by the hideous working his features
that his spirit experienced intolerable agonies to him
such expressions were tones horribly discordant all was
uproar and havoc within his own bosom and the gaiety 
other men inspired him with sentiments invincible antipathy
he never saw a festive board without an inclination
to overturn it or a father encircled with a smiling family
without feeling his soul thrill with suggestions murder
something i know not what withheld his hand it might
be some remaining atom humanity it might be for
his whole character was contemplative and close it might
be that he regarded that as a pitiful and impotent revenge
which should cause him the next hour to be locked up as a
madman or put to death as criminal horrible as was his
personal aspect and wild and savage as was his mind yet
as i have already said i felt myself attached to him i
travels op st leon 
knew that all the unsocial propensities that animated him
were the offspring love were the sentiments a lioness
bereaved her young and i found an undescribable and
exhaustless pleasure in examining the sublime desolation 
a mighty soul
bethlem gabor had at first regarded me with some degree
 partiality kindness in almost all cases begets kindness 
he could not see how much i interested myself about and
how much i courted him without feeling for me a sentiment
different from that he confessed for other men i saw
however after some time with inexpressible grief that his
regard for me instead increasing suffered perceptible
diminution our propensities were opposed to each other
he rejoiced in disorder and desolation as in his congenial
element my present pursuit was the restoration public
order and prosperity he repeatedly expostulated with me
on this i had sometimes in our conversations in the bitterness
 my recollections exclaimed on myself as the
most unfortunate and most persecuted men though
without entering into an explanation my sufferings he
reminded me these exclamations he reproached me asa
contemptible and pusillanimous wretch that i did not
like him resolve amply and memorably to revenge my own
sufferings upon my species at large in his estimate the
poorest and most servile all maxims was that the
author the christian religion to repay injury with favour
and curses with benediction
i perceived with grief that the kindness towards me that
had been excited in bethlem gabor's mind rather declined
than augmented but i was very far from being aware 
the degree in which as i afterwards found this sentiment
had relapsed into its opposite it seems i inflicted on him
a daily torture by my daily efforts for the dissemination 
happiness these he had not been at first completely
aware his mind had been too much absorbed in its own
feelings to attend very distinctly to any thing i did unless
it were done in his presence but in proportion as i
soothed his sorrows and made him my confidant the film
was removed and all that he saw had the peculiar misfortune
to excite at once his contempt and his rage the
d d
 travels st leon
finishing stroke that i gave to the animosity which unknown
to me was now brooding and engendering in his
breast consisted in my bestowing an important benefit
upon one against whom he had entertained a long and
eternal feud
chapter xxxix
while bethlem gabor became every day more confirmed
in his antipathy against me i reposed in him an unsuspecting
confidence a confidence more extensive than
i had since the singular and fatal acquisition i had made
reposed in any other man frequently for a considerable
time together he resided under my roof frequently we
went forth together in those excursions which either my
projects or his views rendered it necessary for us to make
in his character a nobleman great consideration in
his native country he was now rising like a phoenix from
its ashes his castles were repairing his property was
restored the list his retainers daily became more numerous
 he revived and carefully recruited the martial
band which in the first exacerbations his despair he
had dismissed from his service my purse and all that i
had were his he never made a demand upon me that i
did not instantly supply i reaped a particular pleasure
from the largeness and frequency his requisitions there
was nothing for which i was more anxious than to bind
him to me in indissoluble ties gratitude and affection
little alas did i understand the compound tenderness
and ferocity decisiveness and inscrutability with
which i was now concerned my friend such i esteemed
him had been absent some time i expected his return
to my residence at buda and anxious to pay him every
mark attention and respect i set out to meet him it
was scarcely safe during the existing hostilities between
the austrians and the turks to travel any where without
a guard i had the precaution in the present instance to
take with me an attendance twenty men
travels st leon
it was after having partaken a slight and early dinner
that i set out on my excursion the season was remarkably
fine and the air genial and balsamic i scarcely ever
commenced any tour with more agreeable sensations the
harvest was already ripe and as i passed along i saw
reapers from time to time entering upon the first essay 
their interesting occupation i felt that i had at length
surmounted one those difficulties with which i had been
so strongly assailed and to which i had refused to yield
if i were not free from apprehensions from the arbitrary
nature the government under which i lived i believed
however that i had nothing further to dread from the
misconstruction and animosity the nation i preserved
my anxiety as to whether i should be able to substantiate
the benefit i had sought to confer was at an and i
had little doubt that with the plenteous crops which were
on the point being gathered my popularity would return
and the gratitude my clients become more ardent
than ever it was a delicious enjoyment that i now experienced
 the pleasures that the eye unavoidably takes in
from the spectacle a luxuriant autumn became blended
in my mind with the ideas famine put to flight my own
rectitude vindicated and the benevolent purposes realised
the prosecution which had cost me so profound a heartache

we at length passed the lines the soldiers planted for
the defence the soil against the depredations the
enemy i had calculated that i should meet my guest a
few leagues from buda i was deceived in my estimate
the day however his arrival was fixed i could not be
mistaken in his route i resolved not to turn back without
meeting him the road i took led upon the borders 
that part hungary which owned the austrian yoke 
the shades night were fast gathering round us and we
heard at a distance the alarmguns and the drums the
enemy i was not however a novice in the appearances 
a country the seat military excursions and war and if
my mind were not wholly free from perturbation and
uncertainty i at least resolved not to be turned aside from
my purpose we travelled two hours longer still no
d d 
 travels st leox
notice the approach bethlem gabor at length a
question was started whether we were still in the right
road and i thought it advisable to hold a sort council
 war to deliberate respecting our further proceedings
having assembled my attendants for that purpose i was
now first struck with the apprehensions and timidity which
they unanimously betrayed they had been drawn out
rather for show and to keep accidental stragglers in awe
than with the expectation actual service i became sensible
that nothing was to be hoped from their resistance in
the event an action and the utmost i could aim at was
in the mean time to hold them together by the sentiment
 a common danger
it was resolved to return i began to be apprehensive
that bethlem gabor had been prevented by some unexpected
occurrence from observing his appointment scarcely had
we faced about before we heard a body cavalry approaching
us i called to my party to halt i soon discerned
from symptoms not difficult to be remarked by a
careful observer that the party at hand was composed 
austrohungarians we had every thing to fear from
them i held myself bound under these circumstances first
to make experiment the fleetness our horses i
however charged my people to keep together and not to
suffer the enemy by means our inadvertence and folly
to make an easy prize us one after another in a short
time i found that our pursuers sensibly gained ground upon
us i was mounted upon an excellent beast and could
easily have rode away from my troop while they would
have been placed as a sort intercepting object between
me and the enemy but i had too much a military
spirit not instantly to reject so inglorious an expedient i
called a second time to my attendants to halt i judged
that the party our antagonists was less numerous than
ours i was convinced that our common safety depended
upon our concerted resistance filled with the gallantry
that my situation inspired i did not perceive till it was too
late that my present call to halt was attended to by few 
even those few rather hung back divided between apprehension
and shame i was the foremost and before i was
travels op st leon 
aware i found myself through the means the darkness
enveloped by the enemy from my appearance they
judged that i was the master and the rest my attendants 
they contented themselves therefore with the prize they had
made and did not give themselves the trouble to pursue
the fugitives they eagerly enquired me who i was 
and comparing my answers with various circumstances
which rumour had brought to their ear they easily concluded
that i was the rich stranger buda the character
they had heard me did not produce in these freebooters
any sentiments forbearance or demonstrations respect
the only point about which persons their habits were
concerned was how they should make the greatest advantage
 what the fortune war had thrown in their
way
while they were consulting and various expedients were
started by one and another for this purpose a second alarm
was given and one the party being despatched to reconnoitre
presently returned with intelligence that the persons
approaching were horsemen the enemy and that they
amounted as he guessed to forty in number upon this
information the party whose prisoner i was agreed to return
with all expedition by the way they had come and
commanded me upon pain death to proceed in their
company this menace had not the effect to deprive me 
courage or presence mind and i easily conceived that
the readiest way to deliver myself from my embarrassment
would be to join at the first opportunity the band turcohungarians
whose approach had occasioned our sudden
retreat the darkness the night was favourable to my
purpose and taking advantage a sudden winding in
the road i slackened all at once the pace my horse without
being observed by my companions who as the enemy
approached had now their thoughts almost wholly intent
upon the safety their retreat they passed me and i
no sooner perceived that to be the case than covered from
their observation by the intervening inclosure i turned my
horse and gradually as my distance from my keepers increased
urged him to a fuller speed it was not long
before i came up with the band which had produced our
d d 
 travels st leon
alarm and hailing them with the acclamation long live
the mighty sultan was without difficulty admitted into
their troop i instantly understood to my great joy that
this was the party bethlem gabor that i had come out
to meet
he received me with much cordiality and seemed greatly
rejoiced that fortune had made him the instrument my
rescue he proposed however that having met on the
road i should now instead proceeding to buda return
with him to his northern castle from which our distance
was scarcely greater than from the metropolis the proposal
was such as i had not expected nor could i well
comprehend the purpose with which it was made but the
habitual demeanour bethlem gabor neither accorded
with his minutely assigning a reason for what he did nor
was calculated to encourage enquiry in another i saw no
material objection and therefore felt little scruple in yielding
to his desires our brief consultation on this point
passed at some little distance from the rest the troop
when the morning broke the first thing that excited
my attention was the appearance his followers they
were full forty in number well mounted a large and
athletic figure with sunburnt faces immense whiskers and
a ferocious countenance i thought i had never seen so
tremendous a band to me they were every one them
strangers all the persons that surrounded me the only
one whom i had the slightest knowledge was bethlem
gabor himself i know not why it was but i no sooner
beheld my situation than i was struck with alarm i saw
myself completely in the power a man who three months
before was ignorant even my existence i had not a
single attendant my own not an individual with me over
whom i had personal authority or command i had no
reason to distrust my host towards me his demeanour had
ever been frank confidential and manly i had every
imaginable claim upon his generosity and his gratitude
but our senses are often the masters our mind and reason
vainly opposes itself to the liveliness their impressions
every time that i lifted my eyes and saw myself
hemmed in by these barbarians my heart seemed involun
travels op st leon
tartly to fail me bethlem gabor too appeared to neglect
me he had never shown himself so little obliging and attentive
as at this moment and aided by the rest the
scene i thought i had never beheld him so deformed or so
tremendous i was more than half inclined to wish myself
again a prisoner with the austrian s
when we arrived at the castle we were all us fatigued
and hungry we had roamed during the whole night a
repast was prepared we sat down to partake it excuse
me said bethlem gabor in a low voice as he passed
me that i this night offer you the fare a soldier tomorrow
you shall be accommodated in a different manner
the words were innocent the proceeding natural but
there was a mysterious gloom at least as i thought in the
tone in which he spoke that electrified me the hall in
which we supped was spacious and lofty the naked walls
and rafters were imbrowned with age though it was
daybreak as we entered the windows were still darkened
and the apartment was illuminated only by the partial
glare lamps depending from the roof as i sat at table
with the troop my host i appeared to myself as if inclosed
in a cavern banditti though excellent partisans
skilful in execution and perfect in their discipline they were
unpolished in their manners and brutal in their conversation
i had been inured from infancy to all the refinement
that the age in which i lived had any where to boast and
amidst the various evils i had suffered that being associated
with the vulgar and the base had never presented
itself while they uttered now a loathsome jest and now
a sanguinary ejaculation i became ashamed my species
and the pride manhood perished within me they however
paid little attention either to my feelings or my person
and accustomed as i had been whether with friends or
enemies to be regarded as some importance i found
myself unaccountably and suddenly dwindled into a cipher
i felt it like a release from the state a galleyslave when
bethlem gabor proposed that we should break up our meeting
and retire to rest
d d

chapter xl
a succession gloomy thoughts revolved in my mind for
some time after i was left to myself i was however overcome
with fatigue and after an interval harassing
meditations insensibly fell asleep i was awakened after
some hours repose by the presence bethlem gabor
standing by the side my couch he invited me to rise
and when i had attired myself started the plan our
visiting together the various apartments the castle a
small part which only had been seen by me when i was
last at this place among other things he told me there
was a subterranean most wonderful extent interspersed
with a variety cells and lurking places which no man
had to his knowledge ever ascertained the number
the same dreary complexion thought followed me
today which had been first produced in me upon my reception
into the troop bethlem gabor the preceding
night my sensations were the most depressing and
discomfiting nature i felt as if i were the slave some
dark mysterious tyrant and dragged along supinely wherever
he motioned me to go i tasked myself seriously i reasoned
with myself i felt that it was no idle and everyday
part that i was called to sustain and i resolved that
i would not be ruined by my own inactivity and cowardice
yet when i examined the question dispassionately i could
not find that i had any occasion for courage and i confessed
that it was not less censurable to discover a useless
spirit mistrust and defiance than to desert one's preservation
where resistance was demanded what reason
had i to suspect a man between whom and myself there
had prevailed so much mutual confidence none none
i replied but the causeless and superstitious misgivings 
my own mind even if had ground to distrust him
what remedy had i against his ill faith placed as i was in
the midst his own domains and surrounded by men devoted
to his service to discover apprehension under such
circumstances was to excite animosity these reasonings
travels st leon 
particularly occurred to my mind as i stood waiting for
the torch which he had himself gone to procure that he
might attend me to the subterranean caverns i had as
yet seen no one since we broke up from our nightly repast
but my host we will breakfast said he when we
return from viewing these curiosities
we crept along a succession dark and gloomy vaults
almost in silence bethlem gabor though he led me on
and discharged the office a guide seemed to have small
inclination to assume that an interpreter this was
sufficiently in unison with his ordinary character to have
little claim to excite surprise yet the reader will not on
reflection greatly wonder that my present situation was far
from agreeable i was alone in passages which to judge
from any discoverable token you would scarcely imagine
had for ages been trod by a human creature the voice
was lost amidst the damps these immense caverns nor
was it possible by any exertion to call the hand man to
your aid my guide was an individual whom calamity
had prompted to quarrel with the world strong feelings
indeed capacious thought but rugged ferocious brutal
and inaccessible to prayer i had chosen him for my protector
and ally i had never intended to put myself in his
power there was a mystery in his carriage a something
not to be explained a shell that no human forces could
penetrate that was mortal to confidence and might quail
the stoutest
i thought there would be no to our pilgrimage at
length we came to a strong door crossbarred and secured
with a frame iron bethlem gabor unlocked it we
had no sooner entered that it impetuously closed behind
us what is that said i startled at the loudness 
the report come on cried my host it is only the
wind whistling through the caverns the springbolt is
shot but i have the key in my hand at the opposite
 the apartment was another door with an ascent 
five steps leading to it bethlem gabor unlocked that
also and then faced about with the torch in his hand i
was close behind him stay where you are said he
with a furious accent and thrust me violently from him
 travels st leon
the violence was unexpected i staggered from the top 
the steps to the bottom this door closed with as loud a
report as the other bethlem gabor disappeared i was
left in darkness
for an instant i doubted whether the situation in which
i thus found myself were the result design or accident
the shutting the door might be ascribed to the latter 
the action however and the words my host did not admit
 that interpretation i stood motionless astonished
and almost incapable reflection what an incredible
reverse was thus the creature a moment yesterday i
possessed unbounded treasures and the hearts the whole
turco hungarian nation yesterday as i rode forth on
this fatal excursion i beheld the food a mighty people
mature for consumption the growth my exertions and
it will not be thought surprising that my heart leaped within
me at the sight who would not have envied the unparalleled
eminence at which i had arrived my triumphs
were attended with no melancholy exceptions to damp their
joy they were the children no intrigue they were
manly frank ingenuous and honourable my laurels were
stained with no drop blood were tarnished with no tears
 the widow and the orphan how much more noble to
rescue mankind from famine and death than to violate the
honest pride their nature with the exhibition victories
and trophies 
yet truly considered there was nothing abrupt in the
reverse under which i was now suffering the whole was
a chain every link which was indissolubly connected from
one to the other my attempt to rescue a people from
the horrors famine necessarily exposed me to unfavourable
accidents and misconstruction it inevitably led to
my application to the government for its aid it could not
fail to excite the alarms and jealousies government as to
the tendency my proceedings by exhibiting me as the
possessor immense wealth with very limited means for
the protection that wealth it marked me a prey to a rapacious
viceroy or his more despotic master when i became
sensible the precarious situation in which i stood towards
the powers the state could i have fallen upon a more
travels st leon 
natural expedient than the endeavour to cover myself with
the shield friendship and gratitude in the person one
 its nobles but this expedient would almost infallibly
lead to the placing myself sooner or later in the power 
the man whose friendship i sought i had done so and
this was the termination my views and my projects 
i now well understood the purpose that inattention
and neglect with which bethlem gabor had treated me the
preceding evening the uneasiness resulting from which i
had blamed in myself at the time as the dictate weakness
and unworthy suspicion yesterday i had been placed
under the safeguard a nation every man in buda and
its environs was familiar with my person every man would
have been ready almost to sacrifice his life to procure my
safety now i was far from the scene my philanthropical
exertions no one in the troop bethlem gabor knew who
i was he had appeared to treat me the preceding evening
with indifference and contempt if they saw me no more
no curiosity would by that circumstance be excited in their
minds my clients on the other hand in the vicinity the
metropolis however great an interest they might take in
my fortune had no clue that could lead them to the knowledge
 it they must suppose me a prisoner with the
austrians or that i had been killed in resisting to become
their prisoner i was cut off from all assistance and discovery
and left as much in the power my treacherous
ally as if i had been alone with him oppressed with the
utmost disparity personal force in the remotest island 
the pacific ocean
such were the reflections that early suggested themselves
to my mind in the solitude and darkness in which i was thus
unexpectedly involved meanwhile one tedious hour succeeded
to another and i remained unintended on and unnoticed
i could form no conjecture as to the object 
bethlem gabor in the atrocious perfidy he had committed
could he have any resentment against me and did he
meditate revenge he had received from me nothing but
benefits did he employ restraint on my person as the
means extortion i could not conceive that he could
have any clue leading him to the discovery my grand
 travels st leon
secret and short this my bounties had been so exuberant
as i imagined left him nothing to wish in this wilderness
 conjecture i however fixed upon extortion as a
motive less incredible than revenge i impatiently waited
till the appearance my tyrant should free me from some
part my present uncertainty
he did not appear in the mean time i was in a condition
feeble and exhausted the exercise yesterday the
hourlybaffled expectation meeting him whom i had
called my friend the alternation being first taken prisoner
and afterwards rescued had extremely fatigued me
we had travelled during the whole night yet the unaccountable
dejection mind under which i laboured on our
arrival at bethlem gabor's castle had prevented me from
taking almost any share in the coarse repast that had then
been set before us the entrance my host in the morning
had rendered my slumbers short as i followed him to my
dungeon unconscious whither i went my limbs ached and
my heart ached still more i was ill prepared for a fast
 thirtysix hours which the brutality my jailor inflicted
upon me after having long expected him in vain i gave
myself up to despair what a termination life for him
who possessed the philosopher's stone 
i cannot do justice to the sensations that now took possession
 my mind it was not the deadly calm despair
for i still expected every moment when bethlem gabor
would appear i believed than he would and i believed
that he would not leave me to perish i listened with eager
attention to every sound and my soul floated on the howling
winds in vain nothing came it there was no
alteration in the sound or only those vicissitudes to which
the howling the wind is unavoidably subject i then
turned away in anguish i cursed i stamped with my
feet i smote my forehead with my closed hand i tore
my hair anon another sound arrested my attention it
was a different howling it seemed to be like a human
voice my fancy created to me the tread a human foot
i listened with more intentness soul than ever it was
again in vain 
no no he will not come he will never come why
travels st leon 
should i agitate myself to no purpose let me lie down
and die i reasoned with myself why should i wish
to live i am nothing to any human being i am alone in
the boundless universe i have no tie to existence st
leon has no wife st leon has no child he has neither
connection nor friend in the world even in this wretched
vision the philosopher's stone have i not tried it enough 
have i any hopes from it is it not time that i should
throw away that and existence together my meditations
were ineffectual i suppose it is the case with all men thus
violently thrust out life in the full possession their
faculties i know it was the case with me the more
peremptory was my summoner the more obstinately i clung
to the worthless toy
at length i laid myself down on the floor and if i occasionally
listened i no longer ran to the walls and the
doors to catch the uncertain sounds the gnawing i now
felt within were intolerable they were at one period so
severe that can compare them to nothing but the sensation
 having swallowed a glowing ember afterwards
the weakness nature would no longer feed this excruciating
pain and it subsided into a starting and convulsive
throb the pain was diversified with intervals a deathlike
and insupportable sickness but no i will not attempt
to describe the horrors hunger sublimed by despair where
the torture the mind gives new pungency and uproar to
the corporeal anguish the image as it now presents itself
to my recollection is too dreadful
at last i sunk into a state insensibility and the agony
i had suffered seemed drawn to its final close the busy
turmoil the feverish dream human existence was at an
 i shut my eyes and i believed i should open them
no more
chapter xli
how long i endured this suspension the vital faculties i
cannot tell the next impression on my sensorium subsequent
to those i have described was a sort external
 travels st leon
twitching and violence that seemed to persecute me it was
an importunity from which i felt desirous to escape i
longed to be undisturbed and at rest the intruder on my
quiet would not leave me and i at length roused myself
as if to put away my cause molestation my thoughts
were all confounded and obscure i knew not where i
could scarcely be said to know who i was a little more
effort brought with it a further capacity perception i
saw before me what was now the chief object my mortal
aversion the figure bethlem gabor it was some time
longer before i became aware that he had been employed
in taking up my apparently lifeless corpse placing it on a
stonebench in the side the cave and chaining it to the
wall he observed the motions that indicated in me returning
life he remarked the stare my glassy and rayless
eyes he now spoke with a stern and unpitying voice
there is food there is a light eat having thus said he
left me
what a cruel and remorseless treatment he cared not
for my life he disdained to make the slightest exertion to
restore me he left it to chance whether i should revive or
perish the figure a dying man that i presented did
not make one fibre his bosom bend or quiver
i revived i ate by degrees i recovered from the
deadly languor which had invaded my senses in about twelve
hours longer bethlem gabor returned with a new supply 
sustenance i was now strong enough to be able to converse
with him i heard the heavy sound opening locks and
removing bolts before he entered and i summoned my
faculties to expostulate with him
why am i here what is the meaning the unworthy
way in which you treat me 
it is he regarded me with a truculent aspect as if
he would pierce through my heart because i hate you 
you hate me good god is it possible what evil
have i done to you what good have i not done you 
what supplies have i refused you what occasions have
i neglected studying your advantage your interest and
your honour if thus your hatred is purchased how shall
that man demean himself who is to purchase your love 
travels st leon
oh think not my hatred idle or capricious heaven
knows i would have refrained from hating you if i had
been able i struggled against it with all the energies 
my soul but you have committed towards me the most
mortal offences that man ever endured there is an antipathy
between your nature and mine that all the menstruums
in the world could never bring to coalesce
eternal providence and what is the source this
antipathy 
and do you profess ignorance have you not gone
on day after day with the full consciousness and will to
torment me have i not warned you and expostulated
with you times without number 
 what have you warned me 
i hate mankind i was not born to hate them i have
no native obliquity character i have no diabolical maliciousness
 constitution but they have forced me to
hate them and the debt abhorrence shall be amply paid
i loved as never mortal loved no human heart was
ever so devoted and centred and enveloped in the kindly
affections family and parentage as mine has been was
not my wife were not my children murdered when i
came home to feast my eyes and tranquillise my soul with
the sight them did i not find all waste and desolation 
did i not find their bodies naked pale disfigured with
wounds plunged in blood and already putrid this was
the welcome i looked for this was the object i so
speeded to see no never was a moment like that my
whole nature was changed in an instant my eyes were
blasted and dried to horn my blood froze in my well
stored veins i have no longer delight but in human
misery
my revenge is not causeless this was not the act 
individuals all men in the place these murderers
would have done as they did they are in a league together
human pity and forbearance never had a harbour
but in my breast and i have now abjured them with
something more inwrought vigour and energy i will
become like to my brethren all men are excited by the
same motives urged by the same temptations influenced
 g travels st leon
by the same inducements why should i attempt a futile
distinction when nature had made none all men bear
the same figure i cannot view the human figure without
a torture the most dreadful
i always knew answered i your general hatred 
mankind but your manners and your behaviour persuaded
me that you exempted me from the general censure
f i wished to do so you made the attempt impossible
you told me that you had suffered the same misfortunes
which i had that you by the injustice and persecutions
 men had also lost your wife and your children i
hailed you as a brother in my heart i swore to you
eternal friendship i said we will carry on this holy warfare
together we communicated to each other our mutual
sorrows with you and you only i found moments 
consolation
soon i discovered my mistake instead like me
seeking occasions glorious mischief and vengeance you
took upon yourself to be the benefactor and parent mankind
what vocation had you to the task with the
spirit a slave who the more he is beaten becomes the
more servile and submissive you remunerated injuries with
benefits i found that there was not within you one atom
 generous sentiment one honest glow fervent indignation
chickenhearted wretch poor soulless poltroon 
to say the best you to your insensate heart it was the
same whether you were treated with reverence or scorn i
saw you hunted hooted at and pursued by the people you
fed you held on your course and fed them still i was
compelled to witness or to hear your senseless liberalities
every day i lived could i submit to this torment
and not endeavour to remove it i hate the man in whom
kindness produces no responsive affection and injustice no
swell no glow resentment i hated you the more because
having suffered what i had suffered your feelings
and conduct on the occasion have been the reverse 
mine your character i thank god is all beings the
most opposite to that bethlem gabor
at length you filled up the measure the various
thwarting with which you daily insulted me there was
travels st leon 
one native hungary between whom and me there subsisted
an open and eternal war i relate in no human ear
the cause my animosity to that man suffice it that it
was deep immeasurable inexpiable with a refinement 
cruelty and insult difficult to conceive you chose that man
for one the objects your beneficence would i consent
to see my name joined in pension list with my mortal
enemy the injury you inflicted on me would have been
less if you had stabbed me to the heart less that
would have been a blessing i impose on myself the task
 living for my revenge but never shall i deem that man
my foe who should rid me all this tumult passions
and this insupportable load existence together
you have heard my motives you may wonder at you
you may censure them but they are human i have
nothing further to say to you now you have no need to
recur to expostulation expostulation never moved the
heart bethlem gabor hereafter you shall hear more 
thus speaking he left me and i must confess with
whatever disgrace to my sagacity he opened upon me a
new world i conceived not till now the faintest suspicion
 what had been labouring in his bosom amidst
ah my experience the varieties human character this
was a species that had never fallen under my observation
before what a painful and mortifying occurrence is it
in human life when we have lived with a man from day today
when we have conversed with him familiarly and seen
him in all the changes circumstance and when we
flatter ourselves we have penetrated all the recesses his
heart suddenly to start upon something portentous that
brooded there which to that moment we had not the
lightest suspicion i am not the only individual to whom
this event has occurred
in a subsequent visit bethlem gabor to my cell for
he only attended me with provisions he would intrust the
secret my confinement to no other mortal i intreated
him to inform me with what intention he retained me a
prisoner and to fix a price on my ransom to this overture
he appeared to yield some degree attention he
made no explicit answer but asked with an inquisitive and
js b
 travels op st leon
severe tone in what manner i imagined i could procure
money in my dungeon 
let us agree upon the terms and set me at large you
have never found me deceitful and you shall not find me
deceitful now
f do not hope i will consent to that i ask you again
in what manner do you imagine you can procure money in
your dungeon 
i reflected for a moment liberty is ineffably sweet 
and whatever followed upon the present overture i was
determined not to neglect the faintest prospect that led to a
termination my confinement
there is answered i in my mansion at buda a
chest which if it can be brought to me hither will enable
me to supply your demands i have the key in my custody
and no key but my own will unlock the treasure
give me the key replied bethlem gabor
no rejoined i it is in my custody it is not upon
my person i have taken care that no human hand
shall touch it but my own
and how can i cause this chest to be brought to you
without risking a discovery your situation or that i had
a concern in your disappearance 
 that said i judge for yourself i have made
a proposition to you and i have done enough i will have
no share in the detail qf its execution
well said bethlem gabor after having ruminated
a moment the chest you shall have i undertake that
describe it
i described the chest and its situation in my house
with a minuteness that made mistake impossible
after a considerable time it was brought to me it was too
bulky and ponderous to be introduced into my cell by a single
arm but bethlem gabor having first caused me unconsciously
to swallow a powerful opiate found no difficulty
either to conceal my person in the dark shadows this ragged
subterranean or to cause some his followers to place
the chest within my reach believing that they placed it ina
vacant apartment i awoke and found it at hand i was
secure that the lock was such a one as could not be forced 
travels st leon
but i examined the different surfaces to see whether violence
 any other sort had been exercised on it there were
marks damage but not sufficiently unequivocal to enable
me to form a certain judgment on this point the chest
contained not gold but the implements for making and
fashioning gold allowing for the distance from which it
was brought they appeared to be pretty exactly in the state
in which i left them i had never placed much confidence
in this expedient for softening the heart bethlem gabor 
but i perceived that it would serve at worst to divert my
thoughts and by exciting in me some share expectation
might call off my attention from the miseries my present
condition embracing the occasions when i was most
secure against the intrusion my jailor i provided myself
with the sum that had been previously agreed on between
us my task being finished i carefully displayed the produce
 my labour against the next time bethlem gabor
should visit my cell he viewed it with an air sullen
and gloomy triumph he removed it from the cave which
was my habitation to an apartment this subterraneous
abode little distant from my own when he had concluded
this employment it seemed to be a just inference
that he was to give me my liberty he did no such thing
without uttering a word he closed the door my cavern
locked it and departed
when bethlem gabor next entered my cell i reproached
him with this as with the breach a solemn engagement
his first answer was an infernal laugh expressive 
derision hardheartiness and contempt by and by
however he condescended to explain himself more fully
i made no engagement cried he you talked a
ransom and i suffered you to talk i made you no answer 
i gave you no encouragement boy i deceived you not 
no though my heart pants for vengeance and for misery
i will never be guilty treachery i will break no engagements
 i am a knight and a soldier you have given
me ten thousand ducats what are ten thousand ducats tome
 do you think i am uninformed your secret i
opened your chest i found no gold its contents were
crucibles minerals chemical preparations and the tools 
e e 
 travels op st leon
an artist you are possessed the grand arcanum the
philosopher's stone if i had a doubt it before the
transaction yesterday converted conjecture into certainty
and did you suppose idiot driveller that you are that i
would take ten thousand ducats in commutation for wealth
inexhaustible no you are my prisoner and may choose
in this infallible dilemma whether you will remain my
slave to supply me daily resources as i shall daily think
proper to demand or at once make over to me your whole
mystery and place me in this respect on a level with
yourself
it was now my part to be peremptory and firm
 i refuse said i every part your dilemma and
all that you can propose to me do you talk my remaining
your slave to supply you with daily resources 
do you imagine that shut up in this dungeon i will
nevertheless labour for your gratification do you believe
that that gift which i received as the instrument my
own happiness and the benefit mankind shall be made
the pledge my perpetual imprisonment 
f with regard to imparting to you the secret you suppose
me to possess i answer without hesitation that dearly as
i prize liberty and numerous as are the motives you may
think i have to prize it i will not purchase my liberty at
that rate i would rather spend the days eternity in
this cavern than comply with your proposal the gift 
the philosopher's stone the moment a man possesses it
purifies his mind from sordid and ignoble inducements
the endowment which raises him so much above his
species makes him glory in his superiority and cherish his
innocence he cannot if he would mingle in the low
passions and pursuits the generality mankind for
myself i value too much the verdict my own heart ever
to allow myself to be influenced in the main concerns 
my existence by menaces and compulsion beside this
gift i received for holy and beneficent purposes to such
it is consecrated and if i ever impart it i must select its
depository with all the assiduity and penetration it is practicable
for me to exert you i will henceforth benefit no
more you hate me my disapprobation you is fixed
travels op st leon 
and irrevocable i weep to think how much i have been
deceived in you i weep to think how many high and
heroic qualities in your abreast are now converted into
malignity and venom you the possessor the philosopher's
stone you tell me the sole pursuit the rest 
your life is revenge and human misery what an image
do you raise in my mind if with such dispositions you
possessed the means which the acquisition riches inexhaustible
would confer on you and do you believe
that any consideration on earth could induce me to realise
such an image 
as you please replied bethlem gabor indignantly
i have nothing to propose to you think you that
either as my enemy or my slave and i hold you for both
i would descend to negotiate with you i simply told
you your situation yours be the consequences your
wilfulness and folly 
ff one mistake however that i see you make respecting
my purposes i will remove you seem to suppose that if
you were to communicate to me your secret i would then
set you at liberty no by heavens this cavern is your
abode for ever you shall never go forth from it alive 
and when you are dead here your flesh shall moulder and
your skeleton shall rest as long as the world remains
look round your walls enter fully into possession 
your final home i know that to keep you here and alive
my prisoner i must in a certain sense imprison myself
but at that i do not murmur i shall have the gratification
 beholding my foe and seeing him daily wither in
disappointment you wish to be a father to the human
race and i shall deem the scope my misanthropy almost
satisfied while in your restraint i image myself as making
the human race an orphan never shall bethlem gabor
set at large a man your unnatural and gallless disposition
and your powers for the indulgence that disposition
sieur de chatillon i do not want your secret it
suffices that i know you possess it have i not yourself
in my keeping it will be more joy to me rudely to issue
my commands and to see you complying with them in
spite the most heartfelt reluctance than to possess the
e e 
travels op st leon
richest gift on earth in the fullest independence think
you bethlem gabor incompetent to tame the tenant this
wretched cavern boy you are my prisoner you shall be
my creature i will humble you at my feet and teach you
to implore my bounty for the most miserable pittance
look to it you know your destiny do not provoke my
fury without a foresight the consequences 
i will enter into little further detail this my wretched
imprisonment in the wilds hungary it was not destitute
 its varieties and i could if i pleased fill a volume
with the artifices and the violence my gloomy superintendent
i could fill volumes with the detail the multiplied
expedients the furious menaces the gigantic starts
and rhapsodies passion by which he alternately urged
me to compliance and concession but i will not i will
bring to an the history bethlem gabor and then
having detailed the surprising events that immediately followed
it will close the page st leon's history for ever
i stood like a rock shut out from all other gratifications i
at least resolved to accumulate in my own person all the energies
 resistance if i were to unfold the story i could
command the reader's astonishment his admiration but the
object these papers is to record not my merits but my fate
how different was my imprisonment in the cavern the
manabhorring palatine from that which i had experienced
in the dungeons the inquisition there an inexorable
apathy prevailed my tyrants were indifferent whether i
died or lived filled with the sense their religious elevation
they held on the even gravity their course and
counted my groans and my tears neither for remorse nor
pleasure the variety i experienced in their dungeons was
the growth my own thoughts from without i encountered
no interruption it was not to be ascribed to those
who held me in durance if my faculties were not lethargic
into death bethlem gabor possessed no share their apathy
 his malice was ever alive his hatred ever ingenious
and new in its devices he had a purpose to answer to
extort from me the supply his necessities and projects it
was not so much perhaps that he stood in need this as
that he placed a pride in it and had fiercely resolved to show
travels st leon 
me that i was unreservedly his slave his animosity against
me was so fixed and insatiable that nothing that was pain
to me was indifferent to him if at any time he saw me
subsiding into insensibility he failed not to exert himself to
sting me into life again
the consequence this was somewhat different from
what bethlem gabor expected desponding as i was
weary life and almost finally alienated from the allotted
gift the philosopher's stone if he had left me to
myself i should very probably have sought in insensibility
relief from the torment my own thoughts but he
taught me a better lesson refusing me the indulgence 
torpor he obliged me to string myself to resistance he
gave me a passion he gave me an object he gave me comparative
happiness i was roused to opposition i was
resolved that placed as i seemed to be at his mercy i
would yield him no atom his desires thus employed
i found in my employment pride perpetual occasion presented
itself for fortitude and i gradually ascended to the
sweets consistency perseverance and selfgratulation i
had for years been inured to satisfy myself with a sparing
stock pleasures and i was less at a loss to expand and
ramify those which i now possessed than almost any other
man would have been in my situation if my attendant
train sensations was scanty bethlem gabor took care to
afford them a perpetual supply food and employment
and i was comparatively little exposed to the pain 
vacuity when he saw that i was inflexible and that he
could no longer gain from me the smallest compliance with
his will he raged against me with terrifying fury was ita
crime in me that this fury in my tyrant produced the
operation a sedative and a cordial there was no malignity
in the joy it gave me i had much aversion for
bethlem gabor but no hatred i took no pleasure in his
agonies because they were agonies my sympathies towards
him now i confess were small but the joy i felt was
because his fury told me was the unwilling evidence my
own value i left him to assail the mound i opposed to his
desires as he pleased it remained strong and unaffected
as the seabeaten promontory from the inefficacy his
e e 
 travels st leon
efforts i sometimes took occasion to remonstrate with my
jailor and demand the restoration my liberty but
bethlem gabor was not a man whom arguments and expostulations
like these could move in spite himself
however i commanded his wonder if not his esteem he
regarded the contrast as almost incredible between the
boyaspect under which he saw me and the inflexibility
and resources my timeinstructed mind
the contentment that i have here described in myself
was however a creature the imagination the forced progeny
 uncommon effort it was no natural state the
soul my mind would sometimes wander beyond the
limits my cavern and remember that there were other
persons beside bethlem gabor and myself in the world
i recollected the situation in which i had left my great
project for the reviviscence hungary and rejoiced to
remember that it was already in such forwardness as i
hoped no longer to stand in absolute need my assistance
yet what i had done was but a small portion a dismembered
branch what i had meditated to do and what
every person a generous and enterprising mind who
had been in possession the philosopher's stone would
have designed why was i thus stopped in the commencement
 a career so auspiciously begun and to which
an ardent fancy would prescribe no limits why was
every power the social constitution every caprice the
multitude every insidious project the noble thus instantly
in arms against so liberal and grand an undertaking
 nor could i help repining at the perverseness 
tiny fate which had decreed that i should savour all the
bitterness incidentally resulting from my plan and not be
permitted so much as to taste the applause and reward that
ought to grow out its completion thousands men
were at this instant indebted to my generosity and exertions
for every blessing they enjoyed and i was cast forth
as the refuse the earth pining under the alternate succession
 solitude negligence and malice my very existence
and the manner it unknown except to one
individual who had from the strangest and most unexpected
motives sworn eternal hostility to me
travels st leon 
bethlem gabor had resolved that so long as he lived i
should remain a prisoner when he died if he continued
my only jailor the single individual acquainted with the
place my confinement the probable issue was that i
should perish with hunger twelve years before i should
have contemplated this attitude and condition existence
with indescribable horror but within that time i had
been better taught i had received an education i thank
them in the dungeons the spanish inquisition and if
that be properly considered it will not be wondered at that
i was superior to ordinary terrors early in my present
situation the presentiment had suggested itself to me that
by some striking event i should be rescued from my
present confinement and improbable as the suggestion
was it made an indelible impression on my mind i had originated
in or it had produced a dream the scenes which
had appeared particularly luminous and vivid i imagined
i saw a knight cased complete in proof enter my prison
a smile angelic kindness beamed on his countenance
he embraced me with ardour he made a sign to me to
follow him i felt that i had seen him somewhere that
he had been my intimate friend yet all the efforts i made
in sleep or afterwards when i was awake were unavailing
to remove the mystery that hung upon his features i
rose to obey him the ground trembled under my feet like
an earthquake presently with the incoherency usually
attendant on a dream the figure changed to that a female
 unblemished grace and beauty it unfolded a pair 
radiant wings we ascended together in the air i looked
down and saw the castle bethlem gabor a prey to devouring
flames here ended my dream i soon felt that
i could reason myself out all confidence in the presages
 this wild and incongruous vision but i refused to doit
my consolations were not so plenteous in this frightful
solitude as that i should willingly part with one so delicious
reason thus applied i contemplated as an abhorred
intruder it was for a long time part my
occupation in every day to ruminate on this vision not
with the sternness a syllogist bat with the colouring 
a painter and the rapture a bard from thus obsti
 travels op st leon
namely dwelling on it in the day it happened that it became
again and again and again my vision the night slumbers
like these were truly refreshing and armed and nerved me
for the contentions my tyrant sacred and adorable
power fancy that can thus purify and irradiate the
damps a dungeon and extract from midnight glooms
and impervious darkness perceptions more lovely and inspiriting
than noontide splendour 
chapter xlii
i had now continued here for several months and in all
that time had received no external impressions but such as
related to the cell i inhabited and the misanthropical savage
by whom it was visited one evening that bethlem gabor
entered my dungeon i observed in him an air unusual
disturbance where apathy reigns the intercourse between
those over whom it presides will be marked with a deathlike
uniformity but wherever the furious passions take
their turn they will occasionally subside into a semblance
 familiarity and benevolence there was something in
the countenance my tyrant that made me for a moment
forget the complicated injuries i had received from him
what is it that has disturbed you cried i there was
no answer there was a knitting in his brow and a contraction
in his features that showed me his silence was an
effort he departed however and had already passed the
threshold my dungeon the door was in his hand he
returned chatillon said he perhaps you will never
see me more 
my castle is besieged i have passed through dangers
 a thousand names and i ought not to be made serious
by that which now assails me but a gloomy presentiment
hangs upon my mind the busy phantom life has
lasted too long and i am sick at heart in the worst event
i will not be made a prisoner i will die fighting
f i feel as if this were the last day my existence and
upon the brink the grave animosity and ferociousness
travels op st leon 
die away in my soul in this solemn moment my original
character returns here striking his heart to take possession
 its native home a character stern and serious if you
will hut not sanguinary not cruel not treacherous or unjust
between you and me there is a deadly antipathy 
but you did not make yourself you intended me friendship
and advantage the sufferings you have experienced from
me in return have been sufficiently severe if i die defending
my walls and you remain thus you will perish
with hunger i had intended it should be so but i am
now willing to remit this part your fate i will enter
into a compromise with you i will trust to your fidelity
and your honour i will take off your chains i will
bring you a timepiece and torches i will leave with you
the key the spring lock your cavern provided you
will engage your word to me that you will not attempt to
make use your advantages till the expiration twentyfour
hours
to these terms i assented without hesitation the chains
fell from my wrists and my ancles i stood up once more
unshackled and in respect my limbs a free man when
bethlem gabor was on the point to depart my soul melted
within me i took hold his hand my fingers trembled
i grasped and pressed the fingers my tyrant i cannot
describe what then passed in my bosom no man can
understand my sensations who had not been in my situation
who had not passed through a treatment arbitrary
ferocious and inhuman and had not then seen the being
who had wounded him so unpardonably suddenly changing
his character commiserating his fate and rescuing him
from destruction
from this time i saw bethlem gabor no more he died
as he had sworn to do in the last dike his fortress
his selfbalanced and mighty soul could not submit to the
condition a prisoner he was nothing if he were not
free as the air and wild as the winds i may be mistaken
 but this appears to me to have been a great and
admirable man he had within him all the ingredients 
sublimity and surely the ingredients sublimity are the
materials heroic virtue i have much cause com
 travels op st leon 
plaint against him he conceived towards me an animosity
the most barbarous and unprovoked but in writing this
narrative i have placed my pride in controlling the suggestions
 resentment and i have endeavoured to do him
justice
i had engaged to wait twentyfour hours i waited only
six i know not how the reader will decide upon the morality
 my conduct but i own i had not the force i believe
i may call it the insensibility to remain in my dungeon
any longer there was no doubt that if bethlem gabor
returned a conqueror the term my imprisonment would
be renewed and all his former menaces continued in force
what should i deserve to have thought me if i could
sit down idly and tamely wait the return my jailor
no liberty is one the rights that i put on when i put
on the form a man and no event is power to dissolve
or abdicate that right what validity was the promise
that bethlem gabor extorted from me by compulsion and
as the condition that which he had no title to withhold 
what gratitude did i owe to this man who treated me with
every contumely and shrunk from nothing bul the thought
 causing me to perish with hunger whatever became
 my attempt to escape i could at least in this vast subterranean
hide myself from the face him who had injured
me i had a provision phosphorus in my chest 
and could therefore extinguish my torch upon the slightest
alarm and relume it at pleasure what was the value 
life situated as i was situated it was better to perish in
the attempt to escape than linger on for ever in perpetual
imprisonment as a further resource i left a billet in my
dungeon for for this also i had implements intreating
bethlem gabor by every motive compassion and humanity
to provide for me the means sustenance as usual
having taken these precautions i lighted a fresh torch 
and unlocking the door and thrusting the key into my
girdle set out upon my expedition though bethlem
gabor had stipulated for twentyfour hours the siege might
even now be over and i trembled every instant lest my
jailor should return
i wandered for a considerable time among the alleys and
travels st leon 
windings this immeasurable cavern i had the precaution
to mark the sides the vault with characters and
tokens as i passed that if necessary i might be able to
find the way back to my dungeon this might prove an
indispensable resource to prevent me from perishing with
hunger once or twice i changed my route inferring
from a comparison circumstances the best i could make
that i was not in the direction the castle from which
bethlem gabor had led me to my imprisonment in all
this wandering i had seen nothing i had heard nothing
which could demonstrate to me that i was approaching the
habitation man i had groped my way for near two
hours when on a sudden i heard a loud and tremendous
shout that almost stunned me and that from its uncommon
shock could be at no great distance from the place
where i stood this was succeeded by a terrifying glare
 light i extinguished my torch both that i might be
better qualified to observe and that i might be less in
danger discovery by any one who should approach me
unawares the shouts were several times repeated the
light i found to proceed from that the vault towards
which i had been advancing and by the best conjectures i
could form i concluded the outlet into the castle to be at
no great distance i heard the crackling the flames
and the fall rafters and beams presently i discerned a
volume smoke approaching me and found that if i remained
long in my present station i should incur the risk
 being suffocated i formed my resolution i concluded
that bethlem gabor's castle was taken and set on fire by
the austrians i believed that my persecutor was already
no more to this faith i was undoubtedly prompted by the
presentiment which he had communicated to me i saw
that it would be impossible for me to emerge into light till
the flames should abate i once more therefore lighted
my torch and returned by the straightest road i could find
to my dungeon arrived there i proposed to pass the
interval quietly in the cavern where i had so long felt the
weight the hungarian's chains suddenly however the
suggestion occurred to me may not my conjectures be
false may not bethlem gabor yet repel the enemy and
 travels st leon
return to me from amidst the ruins his falling castle 
the thought was sickness and extinction to my heart
hope beautiful as are thy visions in how much anguish
and agony do they clothe the terrors disappointment 
never had bethlem gabor been half so dreadful to me as
now i shrunk away i took with me the fragments
 provision that yet remained i hid myself i deemed
no cell remote enough to conceal me from the inhuman
persecution my tyrant
i continued in the subterranean all that day and all the
succeeding night once in this period i attempted to reconnoitre
the avenue my escape but i found the situation
still so heated and suffocating that i did not venture to
proceed at length i came forth from this den horrors
and again beheld the light the sun the path had
already been sufficiently explored by me and i no longer
found any material obstacles i now saw that my conjectures
were true the castle my ferocious adversary was
a pile ruins the walls indeed for the most part remained
but choked with fragments the falling edifice
blackened with the flames and penetrated in every direction
by the light day with difficulty i climbed over
the ruins which opposed my egress from the subterranean
and rendered my passage to the outside the castle an
affair peril and caution here the first object that
struck me was some tents probably the soldiers who
had been employed in this work destruction i was
hailed by a sentinel and i demanded that he would conduct
me to his commander he led me to the centre 
the little encampment and i stood in the presence his
chief i lifted my eye to behold him and was petrified
with such astonishment as till that hour i had never felt
it was charles my son my only son the darling his
mother the idol my soul 
chapter xliii
it may seem extraordinary that i should instantly have
known him he was sitting at a table covered with
travels st leon 
papers and with one or two aidesdecamp waiting to receive
his orders he was clothed in complete armour
and his casque was resting on the ground by his side
when i entered his eye was fixed on a despatch that day
received from the great palatine hungary but in little
more than a minute he raised his head and his countenance
was completely presented to my view it was
fifteen years since i had beheld it he was then scarcely
above half his present age a mere stripling in whom the
first blush manhood had awakened the sentiment independence
and an honour impatient a shade he was
now a leader warlike bands his complexion olivet over
with service and his eye rendered steady with observation
and thought but i knew him j i knew him in a moment
my soul with the rapidity lightning told me who he
was not all the arts in the world could have hid him
from me not all the tales that delusion ever framed could
have baffled me i could have challenged him against the
earth 
i have already had occasion to explain the complexity 
my feelings when after a long absence i visited the
heiresses the house st leon the sweets recognition
that transporting effervescence the mind where
the heart bounds to meet a kindred heart where emotions
and tears mingle in speechless encounter where all is
gazing love and strict embrace these pleasures were
denied me i stood stiff and motionless in the presence 
my child my heart might burst but it must not and it
could not communicate its feelings
after an instant's pause overwhelming sensation i
sunk back on myself and considered my own figure it
happened that exactly opposite to me in the tent my son
hung his armour and over the rest his polished shield in
which i saw my own person clearly reflected the youth
 my figure indeed was still visible but the hardships 
my dungeon had imprinted themselves in glaring characters
on my face my beard was neglected my hair was matted
and shaggy my complexion was a strong and deadly
yellow my appearance to a considerable degree told my
story without the need words charles enquired 
 travels st leon
those who brought me where they had found this wretched
and unhappy figure and was told that i had been seen a
few minutes before coming out from the ruins bethlem
gabor's castle he humanely and naturally concluded
that i was a victim on whom the tyrant had exercised his
ferocity and that i had been shut up in some dungeon 
the fortress it was impossible that any person above ground
in the castle should have come out alive from the operation
 the flames he commanded that i should be led to a
neighbouring tent and taken care after having been
refreshed with food and rest and attired with other apparel
he directed that i should be brought to him again
that he might hear my story
under these circumstances there was nothing for which
i was more anxious than that i might recruit myself and
shake off as quickly as possible the effects my confinement
cordials were brought me and i tasted them 
i bathed in a neighbouring stream one my son's attendants
removed my beard and arranged my hair i now
desired to be left alone that i might take some needful
repose i could not sleep but i reclined my limbs upon
a couch and began to collect my thoughts
i saw myself in one hour the sport the most complete
reverse fortune that could happen to a mortal i had
been the prisoner a cavern so wild and pathless as almost
to defy the utmost extent human sagacity to explore
its recesses from this cavern but for the sudden
and extraordinary event which had just occurred i could
never have come forth alive all sober calculation would
have taught me to expect that i should have remained
there chained up like a savage tiger in his cage as long as
bethlem gabor existed and that when he died i should
perish unheard unknown no creature that lived suspecting
my situation no lapse ages ever bringing to light my
dismal catastrophe the remorse and relenting bethlem
gabor towards me seemed so little to accord with any thing
that i had personally witnessed his habits and his mind
that even now i feel myself totally unable to account for it
as it was however i was once again free from the state
 an outlaw imprisoned for life i suddenly saw myself at
travels st leon 
large inspirited by the light the sun and refreshed by
his genial rays in the full possession youth and all its
faculties enabled to return amidst my clients buda or
to seek some new adventure in any corner the earth to
which my inclination led me there is no man however
overwhelmed with calamities however persecuted with endless
disappointment however disgusted with life and all its
specious allurements to whom so sudden and admirable a
change would not convey some portion elasticity and
joy
but there was one thought that entirely occupied me i
cannot describe how my soul yearned towards this my only
son the sentiment even now as i write is an oppression
i am scarcely able to sustain willingly most willingly
would i have traversed every region the globe if so i
might have discovered his unknown retreat and now suddenly
without the smallest effort on my part he was placed
before me his last solemn parting his abjuration my society
and intercourse for ever rose to my memory and gave
a zest inexpressible to our present encounter at the thought
that my son was in the neighbouring tent all earthly objects
beside faded from my mind and appeared uninteresting
and contemptible i instantly resolved to devote myself
to his service and to place all my enjoyment in the
contemplation his happiness and the secret consciousness
 promoting it he had if i may so express myself in
my own person forbidden me his presence in my now
altered figure i might disobey his injunction without fearing
his rebuke let not the reader condemn me that endowed
as i was with unlimited powers action i preferred
a single individual my own son to all the world
beside philanthropy is a godlike virtue and can never be
too loudly commended or too ardently enjoined but natural
affection winds itself in so many folds about the
heart and is the parent so complicated so various and
exquisite emotions that he who should attempt to divest
himself it will find that he is divesting himself all
that is most to be coveted in existence it is not a selfish
propensity en the contrary i will venture to affirm that
the generosity it breathes is its greatest charm beside in
 travels op st leon
my case i considered my own existence as blasted and i
could therefore find nothing better than to forget myself in
my son i had made a sufficient experiment the philosopher's
stone and all my experiments had miscarried my
latest trials in attempting to be the benefactor nations
and mankind not only had been themselves abortive but
contained in them shrewd indications that no similar plan
could ever succeed i therefore discarded for the present
at least all ambitious and comprehensive views and believed
that i ought to be well content if i could prove the
unknown benefactor the son marguerite de damville
i entered into a solemn engagement with myself that i
would forget and trample upon every personal concern and
be the victim and the sacrifice if need were the happiness
 my child dismissing my project becoming a
factor for the hungarian people i determined to lay aside
the name chatillon and cut off every indication that
might connect my present existence with that the rich
stranger buda one the advantages i possessed for
that purpose was that no creature in hungary had the
slightest suspicion that the sieur de chatillon had ever been
the prisoner bethlem gabor
having thus arranged my thoughts i now called for the
garments that had been assigned me they were supplied
me from the stock my son and when i had put them
on i overheard the attendants whispering to each other their
astonishment at the striking resemblance between their
master and myself when i came once more into the
tent their captain and stood as in the former instance
before his shield i did not wonder at their remark
the coincidence our features was so great that had we
passed through a strange place in each other's company i
should infallibly have been regarded as his younger brother
yet there was something marguerite in the countenance
 charles that i wanted when i recovered as in a short
time afterwards i did my vigour and health i was more
blooming than he but there was something graceful ingenuous
and prepossessing in his aspect which i could by no
means boast in an equal degree and which might have
carried him unhurt and honoured through the world we
travels st leon 
shall see some the effects this in what i shall presently
have occasion to relate
when my son required me to declare who i was i
told him as i had already determined to do that i was a
cadet the house aubigny in france that after having
passed through several other countries i had come into
poland withthe floating and half formed purpose entering
as a volunteer against the turk but that before my
plan was completely arranged having been led by my
juvenile ardour in a hunting party far within the frontier
 hungary i had been so unfortunate as to become a
prisoner to the troopers bethlem gabor i added that
when introduced to their chief i had given him so much
offence by the firmness my manner and my refusing to
comply with certain propositions he made me that he had
thrust me into a dungeon from which but for the gallant
exertions the present detachment i should never have
come out alive
charles heard my story with attention and interest he
called on me to resume my courage and my hopes and to
be confident that my sufferings were now at an he
told me that he was a frenchman as well as myself and
like myself had been a soldier fortune he felt he
said a powerful sympathy in my tale j there was something
in my countenance that irresistibly won his kindness and
if i would put myself under his protection he did not
doubt to be the means my future success he spoke
with great asperity bethlem gabor who as an
intrepid indefatigable and sanguinary partisan had been
the author greater mischiefs to the christian cause than
any the immediate servants the sultan constantinople
he congratulated himself that the same action that
had delivered the world from so murderous a renegado had
rendered him the preserver a youth so much enterprise
and worth as he doubted not i should prove he
said there was but one other man in hungary who
had been so effectual an enemy to the cause truth
and christianity as bethlem gabor the name this
man he understood was chatillon and he grieved to say
f f 
 travels st leon
that he bore the appellation a frenchman to the
eternal disgrace the nation that gave him birth he had
joined the turkish standard and by exertions difficult to
be comprehended had rescued the infidels from famine at
a time when but for his inauspicious interference buda
and perhaps every strong town in hungary were on the
point falling into the hands the christians it was
this same man who had revived the resources bethlem
gabor after they had once before by his own fortunate
exertions been routed out and whom i might therefore
in some sense consider as the author my calamities as
well as the inveterate foe christendom such a wretch
as this was scarcely entitled to the common benefit the
laws war and he would not answer for himself if cotillon
had fallen into his power to what extremity his holy
resentment against this degenerate fellowcountryman might
have hurried him providence however had overtaken him
in his impious career and he had fallen obscurely as he
had lived basely in a night skirmish with a party 
marauders from the austrian camp the reader may
believe that i did not a little rejoice that in announcing
myself a few moments before i had taken the name not
 chatillon but d'aubigny what i heard however
occasioned in me a profound reflection on the capriciousness
 honour and fame and the strange contrarieties with
which opposite prejudices cause the same action to be
viewed i could not repress the vehemence my emotions
while i was thus calumniated and vilified for actions
which i had firmly believed no malice could misrepresent
and fondly supposed that all sects and ages as far as their
record extended would agree to admire
in another point view the invective which my son
thus unconsciously poured in my ears had the effect 
making me regard with a more complacent satisfaction the
plan i had formed devoting myself to his service here
i pursued no delusive meteor fame the very essence 
my project lay in its obscurity kings and prelates armies
and churches would no longer find an interest in disputing
about my measures i should indulge the secret promptings
 my soul undisturbed alike by the censure the
travels st leon 
world and its applause it was thus that under every
change fortune i continued to soothe my soul with delusive
dreams
meanwhile my project went on with the happiest auspices
the friendship between me and charles continued
hourly to increase as a frenchman whom chance had
introduced to his acquaintance in a distant country it was
natural that he should feel a strong bias affection towards
me but that sort fraternal resemblance which the most
inattentive spectator remarked in us operated forcibly to the
increase charles's attachment he would often in the
ingenuous opening his soul towards me call me his
brother and swear that i should for ever experience from
him a brother's love charles had by this time completed
the thirtysecond year his age i was in appearance at
least ten years younger than he there is something in
this degree disparity that greatly contributes to the cultivation
 kindness and is adapted to the engendering a
thousand interesting sentiments frequently would he exclaim
 our fortunes my dear henry that was the name i
assumed have been in a considerable degree similar we
were both us early cast on the world i indeed at the
immature age seventeen i entered the world without
an adviser or a friend but my destiny was favourable and
i escaped its quicksands and its rocks i have now by a
concurrence happy circumstances obtained a place among
honourable men and soldiers and for what is to come may
reasonably regard myself with some degree confidence
you are yet in one the most dangerous periods human
life your work is all to do your battles are yet to fight
suffer me my dear friend to represent your better genius
and act an elder brother's part you shall find me no
ignorant mentor and no ungentle one
nothing could be more gratifying to me than to see the
shoots affection thus springing up spontaneously in
charles's bosom i willingly humoured the generous deception
that he was putting on himself and heard with
transports inconceivable his assurances kindness and protection
we rode and we walked together we were in a
manner inseparable when he went out to reconnoitre i
f f 
 travels st leon
was his chosen companion when he inspected the discipline
and condition his soldiers he applied that opportunity
to initiate me in the science war when he expected to
encounter the enemy he placed me immediately by his side
sometimes he would open his heart to me and dwell
with a melancholy delight upon his secret sorrows fc it is
no wonder my henry he would say that i feel this uncommon
attachment to you i am alone in the world i
have no father no mother and no brethren i am an
exile from my country and cut off for ever from those 
my own lineage and blood it is with inexpressible delight
that i thus cheat the malice my fate and hold you to
my bosom as if you were indeed my brother i would not
part with the fiction for the mines peru and i know
not whether i do not cultivate it more assiduously and regard
it with a sentiment more anxiety and zeal because
it is a fiction than i should do if it were a reality i had
indeed added charles a mother and when he had
started this theme he would dwell for ever on her praises
i easily saw that never son loved a mother more cordially
than charles loved the allaccomplished marguerite with
what sentiments did i hear her eulogium i could not join
in her praises i could not be supposed to know her i
stood there as the statue prometheus might have done
if after being informed with a living soul the gods had
seen fit to chain its limbs in everlasting marble the passion
within me panted and laboured for a vent but i was
invincibly silent with what sentiments did i hear her
eulogium every word it was a dagger to my heart 
every word said and thou villain wert not thou her
murderer more painfully than the fiercest reproaches
could have done
when charles had celebrated with an eloquence truly
divine this incomparable mother a sudden pang memory
would make him start into rage and this mother i
left this mother i cannot tell whether she is alive or
dead what shall i say the crime or the not less fatal
error my father separated me from this mother i
loved my father i loved him because he was my father 
i had great obligations to him he once had virtues but
travels op st leon
my mother if i could have found her in the wildest
desert africa and have known her virtues a stranger
to my blood descended from the remotest tribe the human
race i should have chosen her for my friend my
preceptress and my guide beyond all that youth and beauty
with their most radiant charms could tender to my acceptance
 
thus unconsciously yet ingeniously did my dear son
from time to time torture his father's heart i could not
even deliver him from the gloomy and wretched uncertainty
whether this mother were alive or dead with one
word i could have composed his soul into a sober grief i
could have said your adorable mother at length rests from
her sorrows she is no longer the victim a misguided
and a cruel father you have no longer occasion to brood
over that most disconsolate reflections i know not what
anguish may be at this moment suffered by her who is entitled
to all my duty and all my affection with one
word i might have told this and that word i dared not
utter
chapter xliv
my son related to me his history and made me the depository
 his feelings and reflections the name st
leon indeed never passed his lips i felt that he had consigned
that to inviolable oblivion the appellation he bore
in the army was the chevalier de damville soon after he
abandoned me at dresden he had entered as a volunteer
in the imperial army charles the fifth was at that time
assembling forces to encounter the confederates the
league alcalde in this situation my son was eminently
fortunate he was distinguished for uncommon
enterprise and courage in some the first actions the
war and early attracted the notice gianbattista caswaldo
count piadena who held an eminent command
under the emperor in this army my son was a party to
f f 
 travels st leon
the decisive battle muhlberg in april four years
afterwards castaldo was appointed commander in chief
against the turks in hungary and the french chevalier
accompanied his patron to this new scene military enterprise
charles had felt dissatisfied with the grounds and
motives war between the catholics and protestants 
germany men worshipping the same saviour and appealing
to the same authorities but many them at least
from the most upright and ingenuous scruples differing in
their interpretation those authorities but in their contentions
between the crescent and the cross he entered
with unbounded enthusiasm into all the feelings that constitute
a champion or a martyr he conceived that whatever
was dear to the human race in this world or the next
hung on the issue he regarded the grandeur the cause
as purifying his efforts and consecrating his name and
when he lifted his sword in vindication an expiring
god he felt himself steeled with more than mortal energy
my son dwelt on the merits his patron with a degree
 veneration and love that knew no bounds castaldo
was ranked by the consenting voice mankind with the
most accomplished generals the age in which he lived i
knew him said charles in his most private hours and
stood next to and observed him in the greatest and most
critical occasions his life it was the least his merits
that he distinguished me that he took me up friendless and
an orphan that under every circumstance he was more
than a father to me that he corrected my faults that he
guided me with his advice that he instructed me with his
wisdom and supported me by his countenance castaldo
was the most persevering and indefatigable mankind no
difficulties could undermine his apparent serenity no accumulation
 dangers could appal or perplex him victory
never robbed him his caution misfortune and
defeat never destroyed th grandeur and elasticity his
soul i firmly believe that no general had ever a more discouraging
variety counteractions to struggle with the
enemy was barbarous and sanguinary yet firm and undismayed
in the full vigour their political health under
the rule the ablest their sovereigns the nobles 
travels st leon 
the country castaldo had to defend had almost all them
been alienated one after another by the tricking and illjudged
politics the house austria the nation was
ruined houseless and starving many the officers who
served under my general were the basest poltroons but
they were imposed upon him by his court he was compelled
to place them in important trusts and even when
in the most dastardly way they betrayed those trusts they
were by some pitiful intrigue sheltered from his discipline
and his justice the forces castaldo were mutinous
and ungovernable and he was almost constantly denied
the funds requisite for their pay
f for two years the count piadena struggled with these
complicated difficulties when he had obtained a hardearned
advantage at one extremity the kingdom he
found it rendered useless by some treachery or incapacity
in the other extremity which it was instantly necessary he
should hasten to repair he quelled four alarming mutinies
by his firmness his resources and the prudent combination
 his calmness and seventy in the midst one his
most arduous situations he suddenly received intelligence
that the states hungary which were at that time assembled
were debating whether they should enter into a treaty
with solyman for the purpose placing their country
under the turkish sceptre he immediately flew to the
place council the decision in favour solyman was
drawn up and ready to be adopted but castaldo by his
presence his authority and his eloquence recalled the
states to their duty and prevented them from eternally
staining the christian name surrounded with these difficulties
opposed to an enemy many times more numerous
than the forces he could bring against them and whose
wants were all plentifully supplied castaldo by his single
abilities kept the balance even or rather caused it to incline
in favour the christian scale but what added charles
avails the most consummate merit how may the most
incessant and undaunted exertions be shadowed by the veil
 obscurity the world judges by events success is
necessary to procure the palm fame after two years
 such labours as i witnessed and glory to describe a mutravels
 st leox
tiny broke out among the mercenary troops more formidable
than any that preceded it was no longer even in the
abilities castaldo to quell we honour and respect you
said the mutineers but we will no more serve without
pay we have been baffled two years we will march to the
gates vienna and demand from ferdinand our sovereign
why we are thus denied the arrears that are due tous
they chose leaders for this expedition among themselves
the great castaldo whose peculiar talent it is to
accommodate himself to events and never by any misfortune
to be deprived his invention arid resources saw
what it was that became him having in vain tried every
method for retaining his troops in hungary he offered
himself to lead them to vienna then was seen the true
ascendancy a noble mind goaded with want and distress
they had been deaf to the remonstrances their
general when he sought to direct them against the enemy
but when they saw him submitting himself to their rage
and impatience and fearlessly intrusting his safety to
those who had before refused even to listen to him and
who had reason to fear his retribution as their accuser and
judge they were awed and speechless they almost repented
 their frenzy and were half determined to return
to their duty their remorse indeed was imperfect and
ineffectual but castaldo led this band mutineers
through the heart the kingdom with as many symptoms
 regularity modesty and order as if they had been
the best paid the promptest and most loyal army in the
world
my son spoke in terms the warmest enthusiasm 
the defence erlau in the period castaldo's last and
most arduous campaign against the turks in respect 
fortifications the town was scarcely competent to resist the
feeblest enemy but its deficiency in this point was supplied
by the constancy and valour its garrison and inhabitants
the very women displayed an enterprise that
the more vigorous sex have seldom exhibited jn one instance
a heroine this sort was seen fighting in the presence
 her mother and her husband her husband fell
dead by her side let us my daughter said the motravels
 st leon
ther remove the body and devote the rest our care to
its honourable funeral may god returned the impassioned
widow e never suffer the earth to cover my husband's
corse till his death has been amply revenged this
is the hour battle not a time for funeral and for tears 
so speaking and seizing the sword and shield the
breathless champion she rushed upon the enemy nor did
she quit the breach till by the slaughter three turks
who were ascending the scaling ladders she had appeased
the fury in her breast and the ghost her departed husband
then raising the corpse and pressing it to her
bosom she drew it to the great church the city and
paid to it the last honours with all possible magnificence
many other examples a heroism not inferior to this
were displayed on the same occasion and shall i
added charles in a sally glorious enthusiasm ever
desert a cause which has been thus honoured shall i
betray a soil which has been immortalised by such illustrious
actions shall i join myself to the renegade bethhem
gabor and the execrable chatillon no such virtue
as i have described never could have been conceived
but in the bosom truth great as is the pious devotion
i feel for that god who died on the cross for the salvation
 mankind i own my weakness if it be a weakness his
cause is scarcely less endeared to me by the sublime exertions
 his heroic followers than by his own adorable
condescension and mercy
when the glorious castaldo departed with his rebellious
army for the metropolis germany there was nothing i
more earnestly desired than to accompany his march for
seven years he had conferred on me the benefits and shown
towards me the affection a father and i could not think
 being separated from him without the extremest anguish
beside i regarded it as little less than sacrilege to quit his
side at a time that he was exposed to the furious suggestions
 a host robbers and banditti but he would not allow
me to abandon my post some time said he we must

enough your instructor and if my lessons or my example
can produce improvement in you they must have performed
that office already he treated with disdain the thought
 the danger to which he might be exposed and his need
 a faithful guard a thought which he had detected in the
midst my anxieties but which i had not the courage to
mention this said he is your genuine sphere you
are a young man burning with the zeal truth and religion
you are inspired with the enthusiasm a champion

you it is i shall be engaged in the painful scenes civil
contention between christian and christian misguided and
inflamed by the human inventions luther and calvin
you have before you a clearer and a brighter field and i
confidently persuade myself you will be found worthy 
your happier destiny the count piadena bestowed
me so he was pleased to express himself upon nadasti
the great palatine the realm as the most precious pledge
 his friendship that it was in his power to confer
since the retreat castaldo the christian standard has
obtained little more either attention or aid from our
lawful sovereign now the possessor the imperial throne
ferdinand for a great part this time has had his negotiators
at constantinople whom the insulting turk has
condescended neither sincerely to treat with nor to dismiss
the christian army in hungary has been left to its own
resources but zeal has supplied the place magazines
and religious ardour has taught us to omit no occasion 
annoying and distressing the enemy the most considerable
occurrence this period has been the siege ziget about
four years ago solyman taking advantage certain factious
broils among our hereditary nobility appointed at that
time one his eunuchs bashaw buda and having
placed a numerous a numerous army under his command
dismissed him from the foot his throne with this arrogant
injunction not to enter the capital his province till he
had first sent the keys ziget as an offering to his royal
travels st leon 
master horatio the christian governor this fortification
is one the most accomplished and the bravest 
our native commanders and nadasti having sent him a
reinforcement the better to enable him to support the
threatened siege i was in the number the soldiers appointed
on this service the trenches were opened early
in june and the siege continued for the space seven
weeks the bashaw though an eunuch in person stunted
and monstrous deformity was distinguished for an uncommon
degree audacity and perseverance four times
he filled the dikes the fortification with wood and earth
and as often by means a furious sally the besieged
the materials which had thus with vast expence industry
and labour been accumulated were set fire to and consumed
on the twelfth day the siege he gained possession
 the town and drove us back into the citadel 
but on the day following we recovered the ground we had
lost and from that time the town was his no more the
actions these days were the severest the whole siege 
we fought the enemy street by street and inch by inch 
the great fountain in the marketplace ran with blood we
ascended hills the dead which the infidels opposed as a
barrier to our further progress i seized two turkish
standards and though wounded pursued the enemy
through the eastern gate and returned in triumph nafasti
in the sixth week the siege marched to our relief 
but he was met and worsted by the bashaw who returned
victorious to the foot the walls during the whole 
the siege mutual animosity was cherished by every species
 contrivance and the heads the distinguished dead
were exhibited on both sides as spectacles abhorrence
and terror the inflamed passions the combatants several
times found a vent in listed duels horatio the
governor killed in one these encounters a gigantic turk
who had sent a proud defiance to our host i procured
myself honour upon a similar occasion and the scarf
which i now wear composed the turban the infidel i
slew at length the disappointed bashaw was obliged to
raise the siege and he soon after died grief and mortification
in his palace at buda i confess i recollect the
 travels st leon
christian exploits in the defence ziget in which i also
had a share with rapture and delight they will serve to
awaken in me new animation when hereafter the coldness
 ordinary life might strike palsy to my soul i shall
never think i have lived in vain after having contributed
in however humble a place to arrest the career insolence
and impiety which under the standard the crescent
threatened to overrun the whole christian world
such were the adventures and such the sentiments the
gallant chevalier de damville i had been a warrior in my
youth and the discourse he held was sufficiently congenial
to my earliest propensities i saw indeed that he had
gained in the zeal a soldier the cross a source martial
heroism to which my military history had been a
stranger but though i could not entirely enter into this
sentiment his and indeed regarded it as an infatuation
and delusion i did not the less admire the grandeur soul
with which this heroic fable inspired him there was no
present propensity in my heart that led me to delight in
deeds blood and war i saw them in their genuine colours
without varnish or disguise i hated and loathed
them from my very inmost soul but notwithstanding this
i was sensible to the lustre which military zeal cast round
the character my son nor is this incredible or absurd 
the qualities a generous and enterprising champion are
truly admirable though the direction they have received
should be worthy eternal regret
charles de damville was my friend and when i say
this i cannot help stopping a moment for the indulgence
 reflecting on the contrast between my present intercourse
with my son and my late connection with bethlem gabor
i had sought the friendship the hungarian partisan
partly because i wanted a protector and an ally but partly
also because in my soul i looked up to and admired the
man i called bethlem gabor my friend i persuaded
myself that i had cogent reasons for calling him so but
there was little sympathy between us he was wrapped up
in his own contemplations he was withered by his own
calamities our souls scarcely touched in a single point
no no this is not friendship
travels st leon 
friendship is a necessity our nature the stimulating
and restless want every susceptible heart how wretched
an imposture in this point view does human life for the
most part appear with boyish eyes full sanguine
spirits and hope we look round us for a friend j we sink
into the grave broken down with years and infirmities and
still have not found the object our search we talk to
one man and he does not understand us we address ourselves
to another and we find him the unreal similitude
only what we believed him to be we ally ourselves to
a man intellect and worth upon further experience
we cannot deny him either these qualities but the more
we know each other the less we find resemblance he
is cold where we are warm j he is harsh where we are
melted into the tenderest sympathy what fills us with rapture
is regarded by him with indifference we finish with
a distant respect where we looked for a commingling soul
this is not friendship we know other men we have
viewed their countenances we have occasionally sat in their
society we believe it is impossible we should not find in
them the object we sought but disparity situation and
dissimilitude connections prove as effectual a barrier to
intimacy as if we were inhabitants different planets
it is one the most striking characteristics the nature
 man that we are eternally apt to grow dead and insensible
to the thing we have not half our faculties become
palsied before we are in the slightest degree aware that weare
not what we were and what we might be there are
philosophers who regard this as the peculiar privilege 
man a wise provision providence to render us contented
and easy with our lot in existence for my part
i do not envy and i have never aspired to the happiness
 ignorance and stupidity but be it a blessing or a
curse the phenomenon is undoubted present me with some
inestimable benefit that my nature fitted me to enjoy but
that my fortune has long denied me to partake and i instantly
rise as from an oppressive lethargy before it maybe
i felt myself uneasy but i knew no remedy i
dreamed it was my nature i did not put forth a finger for
relief but now that i have drawn the unexpected prize
 travels st leox
i grow astonished at my former blindness i become suddenly
sensible my powers and my worth the blood that
slept in my heart circulates and distends every vein i
tread on air i feel a calm yet ravishing delight i know
what kind an endowment life is to a being in whom
sentiment and affection are awakened to their genuine
action
this was the effect the mutual attachment produced
between me and charles i looked into him and saw a
man i saw expansive powers intellect and true sensibility
 heart to be esteemed and loved and protected by
such a man to have him to take one by the hand to enquire
into one's sorrows to interest himself in one's anxieties to
exult in one's good fortune and one's joys this and this
only deserves the name existence
i had however a painful drawback upon my satisfaction
it was my fate since the visit the stranger the lake 
constance to rejoice for moments and to lament for years
i could not at first ascend to that purity and eminence 
friendship to forget myself i could not but painfully feel
the contrast between me and my son how happy was
charles how respectable how selfapproving how cheerful
 heart i shall presently have occasion to speak a still
further addition to his happiness i looked indeed young
fair blooming a stranger to care but i had a secret worm
gnawing at my vitals this very deceitfulness my countenance
was a bitter aggravation to my remorse i never
saw my features reflected in the polished shield without
feeling myself struck to the core charles had walked
right onward in the paths honour he feared no detection
he had no secret consciousness that gave the lie to the voice
 applause partiality and friendship but i was all a lie 
i was no youth i was no man i was no member the
great community my species the past and the future
were equally a burthen to my thoughts to the eye that
saw me i was a youth flushed with hope and panting for
existence in my soul i knew and i only knew that i was
a worn out veteran battered with the storms life having
tried every thing and rejected every thing and discarded
for ever by hope and joy when i walked forth leaning
travels st leon 
on the arm him who delighted to call me his younger
brother this was the consciousness that hunted my steps
and blasted me with its aspect whichever way we turned
chapter xlv
among the various confidences reposed in me by my son
one was his love the object his attachment was a
young lady quality named pandora niece to nadasti
great palatine hungary in consequence the earnest
recommendation castaldoin nadasti had taken my
son under his particular protection and charles's principal
home at the periods when the army was dispersed in winterquarters
was at the palatine's house in the city presburg
here his manners had become more polished and his taste
more refined till then bred in tents and living amidst
the clangour arms he had been a mere soldier rough
generous manly and brave but nadasti was an elegant
scholar smitten with that ardent love classical and
ancient lore which has so eminently distinguished the sixteenth
century he assembled round him men letters
from various parts europe and under his auspices the
days matthias corvinus king hungary seemed to be
revived whose love literature was such that he kept three
hundred transcribers in his house constantly employed in
multiplying copies the precious relics roman and
athenian learning the consort nadasti was one the
most accomplished matrons the age in which she lived
and her three daughters were patterns every polite and
amiable accomplishment such was the school into which
the chevalier de damville entered at the age twentyfive
immediately after the retreat castaldo this may seem
an age somewhat late for newmodelling the character but
charles had an enterprising and aspiring temper and he
soon became a distinguished ornament courts and the
society ladies castaldo had taught him all he knew

the temper the manners and the science a military
chieftain the palace nadasti finished and completed the
education my son
pandora was only fourteen years age when charles de
damville first became a sort inmate the house her
uncle she at that time lived with her father but he
being afterwards killed in the battle which nadasti fought
for the relief ziget pandora occupied an apartment in
the palatine palace from the first hour he saw her a
mere child as it were accompanied by her governess charles
confessed to me that he had beheld her with eyes distinction
he had said to himself this little girl will hereafter
be a jewel worthy the crown an emperor he
had found something inexpressibly attractive in the starry
brightness her complexion her air he regarded as both
lighter and more graceful than any thing he had ever before
seen and her speaking and humid eye seemed to him the
very emblem sensibility and sweetness if at the girlish
and immature season fourteen he had ascribed to her all
these perfections it will easily be supposed that as she increased
in stature as the beauties form unfolded themselves
in her and she advanced in sentiment and a lovely
consciousness her worth the partiality charles became
more deep and unalterable but the orphan niece nafasti
was altogether without a portion and the great
palatine would have seen with more complacency the chevalier
de damville addressing his pretensions to one his
daughters
charles confessed to me that the passion he nourished
had been fruitful pleasures and griefs hope and perplexity
it was now almost a year since pandora and
himself had confessed a mutual affection the confession
had not been the result design on either side both had
wished to suppress it pandora from virgin dignity and
reserve and charles because he saw not how their affection
could be crowned with success and he dreaded more than
any misery to himself to be the author degradation and
misery to her he loved but what is ever uppermost in
the heart will at some time or other betray itself their
sympathetic and accordant feelings upon a point so deeply
travels op st leon 
interesting to both rendered them eagleeyed to discern
the smallest indications they had had a thousand opportunities
and a thousand opportunities had been resisted
they became more than usually silent and reserved towards
each other they shunned to meet and when they met
avoided each other's eyes one day a casual encounter ina
solitary retreat which each had sought principally with
intention to escape the presence the other had taken
them off their guard they were mutually hesitating and
perplexed each discerned more unequivocal indications
than had ever occurred before the state the other's
sentiments the entire accord snapped as it were at once
the chains reserve and each after a short interval 
hesitation spoke with an eloquence hitherto untried the
language love the difference years between them
gave a zest to the communication pandora seemed to be
throwing herself upon the protection an elder brother
 a guardian one in whose prudence she confided as the
antidote her inexperience charles felt his maturer years
as imposing on him more severely that sacred integrity the
obligation which at least as society is at present constituted
seems in the majority cases to grow out the
relative situation the sexes the protectorship the
one and the dependence the other
and now exclaimed charles what am i to do 
what am i to desire it would be affectation in me to
conceal from myself on an occasion like this that the reputation
i have acquired both in the arts peace and war
is such as to have caused nadasti to set his heart upon
my becoming his soninlaw the great palatine though
in many respects generous and liberal has that inflexibleness
 opinion which is perhaps more apt to grow up in
the hearts scholars than in other departments society
he is grave and solemn all his habits are a majestic
and lordly nature and i have small reason to hope that i
shall find him accessible to my representations he is little
subject to sallies passion his own propensities are wholly
under the control his judgment and it is not likely
that he will make allowance for the ardent affections 
other minds pandora is entirely dependent on him in
g o 
 travels st leon
any case the portion she would receive from him would he
very inadequate to her worth but discarded and discountenanced
by him who has the absolute rule christian
hungary what can she expect i am myself destitute 
fortune my provision as a soldier will be very inadequate
to the wants the first and softest her sex but even
 that provision nadasti will deprive me if i marry in
opposition to his pleasure shall i make pandora the inhabitant
 tents and encampments shall i expose her to
all the changes and hazards a military life shall i drag
her as the attendant a soldier fortune through every
climate europe no by heavens i should regard
myself as the most selfish and the basest mankind if i
could deliberate on such a question never shall the charmer
 my soul owe a single privation to her charles i love
her with so pure and entire a passion that i prefer her
prosperity to every earthly good nor is it merely necessary
to my attachment that she should live in plenty and ease 
i require that my pandora should be seen in her native
lustre that she should be surrounded with every appendage
due to her merit that she should command applause from
the mercenary and homage from the superficial her
praise is the only music i enjoy i could not bear to hear
her name coupled with levity and scorn i could not bear
that where she appeared every eye should not be turned
to her with reverence and honour my passion i confess
it is that a disciple liberal arts and a nobleman not
that an arcadian
the period the campaign now drew to an and
charles having requested me to accompany him set out
for his usual winter retreat in the city presburg i saw
pandora never in my life had i beheld any thing so
sweetly simple i had always been an admirer the sex 
but the perfections pandora were a nature that i had
not observed in any other woman her symmetry was so
perfect the pearly lustre her skin so admirable and her
form and carriage so light and ethereal that at first view it
was difficult to persuade one's self that she was framed 
the same gross materials as the rest the species she
seemed not constructed to endure the shocks the world
and the rude assaults ill humour or neglect censure or
travels st leon 
adversity her voice was the sweetest the clearest and
softest tone i ever heard there was a peculiar naivete in
her accents that riveted your soul in irresistible fetters
her conversation for in the sequel i enjoyed much her
conversation had a very uncommon zest she seemed to
have no art and what she uttered appeared as if wholly unchecked
by consideration or reserve you were persuaded
that she always delivered without restraint the first thing
that occurred to her mind yet in what she said there was
so much good sense so much true feeling and as the occasion
allowed so much whim and imagination that you could
not discover how any her words could be changed but
for a worse this circumstance strikingly contrasted with
the childish simplicity or rather the feminine softness and
sylphlike delicacy her manner and her tone the opposition
 appearance between her and my son made a
strong impression upon me he was a perfect soldier with
an ample chest broad shoulders and a figure though graceful
and well proportioned yet so strong that it seemed
framed to contend with and to conquer the wrestlers in the
grecian games his complexion shaded with luxuriant
curls manly hair was itself made brown with the rigours
 climate pandora was so heavenly fair so sweetly delicate
and slender that you would have thought she would be
withered and destroyed in his embrace like the frailest ornament
 the garden before the northern breeze but
courage to choose what is rugged and manlike is often characteristic
 the softest her sex
i speedily contracted an intimate commerce with the
beautiful pandora i was naturally desirous to be as consummate
a judge as possible those perfections which i
believed fated to determine the future happiness my son
when sufficiently satisfied in that respect i still continued
the indulgence and found a pure and exquisite pleasure in
the daily contemplation accomplishments that were to
prove the materials his gratification and delight whose
gratification i preferred to my own i had a still further
view in this commerce i was anxious to be perfectly informed
 the connections and family pandora that upon
them i might build a project i had deeply at heart beg

 travels st leon
stowing on her in the least questionable and exceptionable
manner a dowry that should place her upon an equality
with her cousins the daughters nadasti and deliver my
son from all apprehension the unpleasing consequences
to result from the resentment the great palatine nafasti
was opulent and the portions his daughters very
considerable and however inclined i could not exceed
this limit without risking the entire miscarriage my project
charles thought nothing too rich either in situation
or income to do honour to the mistress his soul but
separately from this enthusiastic sentiment both he and
pandora had too just a taste not to prefer the simple majesty
 ancient nobility to the expensive ostentations 
modern refinement
having digested my plan i was obliged to travel as far
as venice for the execution it the mother pandora
had been a venetian and the uncle her mother was one
 the adventurers who had sailed with pizarro for the conquest
 peru he had died before the completion that
business and had left behind him no relative so near to
him in blood as the lovely pandora by a singular piece
 good fortune i encountered at venice an individual who
had sailed in the same ship with the young lady's uncle
the uncle having died prematurely the share he might
otherwise have obtained the spoils peru was sunk in
the shares the rest and nothing was allowed to remain
that might have descended to his heirs his friend and
countryman i found though once rich with the booty he
made had by a series calamities before he reached his
native home been reduced to a state poverty the vicissitudes
he experienced had produced in him the effect
 a very uncommon eagerness for acquisition this man
i fixed on for my instrument i opened to him my plan
and offered him a very ample gratification provided he
acted successfully the part i assigned him in concert with
each other we digested and forged the various documents
that were best calculated to give credibility to the tale
having completed our arrangement i set out for presburg
without a moment's delay and directed my venetian not to
follow till after a stipulated interval he was not to enter
travels st leon 
into full possession his reward till he had completed the
task he had undertaken it was fixed that no person in
hungary should be acquainted with my visit to venice
but only be allowed to understand generally that i had been
engaged for a certain time in an excursion amusement
so hard is the fate the possessor the philosopher's
stone and so limited his power as to have rendered all
these precautions on my part indispensably necessary had
not the various circumstances concurred the detail which
is here stated the birth pandora's mother in a maritime
state the expedition pizarro to peru her uncle's engaging
in this expedition and dying before it was completed
and my own casual rencounter with his compagnon
du voyage my project would too probably have been baffled
a direct gift the fortune i designed would never have
been admitted and had not the coincidence been eminently
favourable even though i should have succeeded in
misleading every other party i could not hope to have
eluded the perspicacity and jealous honour my son
when i returned to presburg i again renewed my intercourse
with pandora the passion entertained by damville
for the beautiful orphan was a secret to every person
at court they had managed so discreetly as to have avoided
every hint suspicion and as it was universally known
that the great palatine had an eye on this gallant soldier for
one his daughters few persons entertained a doubt that
my son would speedily declare his election among the coheiresses
 nadasti on the other hand in the friendly
intercourse between me and pandora neither she nor myself
felt that there was any thing to conceal and it was
therefore a matter complete notoriety my blooming
youth appearance was remarked by the majority 
bystanders we were judged formed for each other and
before i was aware the beautiful hungarian was awarded
to me by the general voice as my destined bride when
however became acquainted with the rumour i was contented
to smile at it the consciousness in my own breast
how far the public sagacity had wandered in its guess gave
to that guess in my apprehension a certain air whimsical
and amusing
g q 
 travels st leon
chapter xl vi
such was the situation the affair pandora and i daily
looked for the arrival my venetian confederate when
suddenly i remarked an alteration in the carriage my
beautiful ally she had hitherto on all occasions sought
my conversation she now appeared sedulously to avoid
me her manner had been characterised by the gaiety
the sprightliness and general good humour incident to her
age and congenial to her disposition she was now melancholy
her melancholy assumed a tone correspondent
to the habits her mind and was peculiar and individual
it had an ingenuous and defenceless air inexpressibly calculated
to excite interest it seemed to ask what have i
done to deserve to be melancholy you felt for her as
for a spotless lily depressed by the unpitying storm you
saw that those enchanting features were never made for a
face sorrow and that that bewitching voice ought never
to have been modulated into an expression heaviness
i was in the highest degree anxious to learn the cause
 this revolution and was the farthest in the world from
suspecting its real foundation i pursued pandora with
so much importunity and demanded an interview with such
irresistible earnestness that she at length consented to grant
it we met in a remote part the garden why
henry said she do you thus persecute me you are
my evil genius the cause the greatest calamity that
could ever have overtaken me
i started for heaven's sake beautiful pandora what
do you mean 
i love the chevalier de damville i have loved him
long he is dearer to me than life and he has cast me off
for ever 
and am i the cause 
yes you and you alone i had for some time observed
a change in his behaviour that he was uncommonly
grave serious and reserved i endeavoured to soothe him
i redoubled my blandishments in our next season untravels
 st leon 
reserved discourse i tenderly enquired into the source 
his grief
for a long time he resisted my importunity at
length faithless girl said he have you the cruelty to
ask the meaning my depression this is the extremity
 insult is it not enough that i know your inconstancy
 is it not enough that i have found you like the
rest your frivolous sex the mere slave your sense 
sight regardless vows regardless an affection which
despised all interests but that tenderness and love
caught by the first appearance something younger softer
and more courtly than i pretend or desire to be will
nothing satisfy you but the confession my unhappiness
from my own mouth do you require expostulation intreaty
and despair from your discarded lover to fill up the
measure your triumph 
for a long time i was totally at a loss to apprehend
my dear chevalier's meaning
no continued he am not jealous there is no
temper i hold in such sovereign contempt as jealousy i
am not a disposition easily to conceive umbrage or
lightly to doubt the protestations the woman i adore i
have been blind too long but i see that you are eternally
together i see that you take advantage the distance at
which the despotic temper nadasti keeps us from each
other to give all your time to my favoured rival you
seem never to be happy out his society i was first led
to throw off the dulness my unsuspecting security by
the general voice the public the whole court gives you
to each other not a creature it holds but has discerned
that passion which you have the insolence to expect to
conceal from me since i have been awakened from my
security i have seen it a thousand times i have seen
your eyes seek and encounter each other i have seen
them suddenly lighted up by your interchanging glances
i have seen the signs your mutual intelligence i have
seen with what impatience the moment you could escape
from the crowded circle you have joined each other and
retired together ungenerous pandora
 but do not imagine i will enter the lists with the gaudy
 travels st leon
butterfly who has now attracted your favour i have told
you already that i am not formed for jealousy i am not
the sort man you have supposed me to be i have loved
you much i have loved you long but i would tear out
my heart from my manly breast if i believed it yet retained
an atom passion for you i know what it was
i loved i loved a character frankness ingenuousness
 simplicity which i fondly imagined was yours but
which i now find was the creature my own fancy
the pandora that stands before me the child art the
base wretch that could take advantage my forbearance in
regard to her uncle which was adopted purely out love
to her the unfeeling coquette that would wish to retain
me in her chains when she had discarded me from her
affections this creature i never did love and i never will
i know low deeply rooted the habit has been in my bosom
 regarding you as the thing you are not i know how
bitter it is to a temper like mine to detect so unlookedfor
a delusion i know what it will cost me to cast you off forever
but i never yet proposed to myself a conquest over
my own weakness that i did not gain nor will i now if
you were to discard this wretched d'aubigny tomorrow
if you were convinced and contrite for your error i
must ingenuously tell you no time no penitence could
restore you to my admiration i had set up an imaginary
idol in my bosom but you have convinced me its
littleness and dashed it to pieces
ff i endeavoured continued pandora by every imaginable
protestation to convince my late faithful lover his
mistake but it was to no purpose all i could say only
tended to swell the tide his fearful resentment
 be silent cried he add no further to the catalogue
 your wanton and causeless delusions do not
make me hate too much what i once so blindly and ardently
adored i feel that i have an enemy within me that would
fain cooperate with your deceptions and hypocrisy i
find that man treacherous to himself is formed by nature
to be the fool your artful sex but i will subdue this
propensity in me though i die for it i may be wretched 
but i will not despise myself have i not seen your falsetravels
 st leon 
hood have not all my senses been witnesses your
guilt the miracle is that i could have been duped so
long i have heard this stripling lover yours inexhaustible
in your praises and dwelling upon them with an ardour
that nothing but passion could have inspired i have
seen as i have already told you the intelligence your
eyes i have seen those melting glances i have heard
those tender and familiar tones between you that bespoke
the most perfect confidence and the most entire mingling 
heart if i did not believe this i should believe worse 
you i should think your heart not merely capricious but
an absolute prostitute j prepared to bestow upon hundreds
those sweet those nameless tenderness accent and
countenance which i fondly imagined were reserved forme
alone i should regard you as the worst and most pernicious
acquisition that could fall to the lot a man
 go pandora added he my heart is chaste my
soul is firm i can no longer be deceived by you i will
not dispute your charms with the idle boy you have now
thought proper to favour and saying thus he burst
from me in an agony impatience
ce alas continued the sweet and ingenuous pandora
my dear henry what shall i do how shall i remove
the unreasonable imaginations this noble mind bear
me witness heaven nothing could be more innocent than
the correspondence i allowed myself to hold with you my
adorable charles was continually calling you brother i
scarcely ever heard him speak you by any other appellation
i regarded charles as my husband i already viewed
you in anticipation as the brother my lord excluded
as i was from frequent conversation with him whom i most
loved i endeavoured to supply the deficiency by an unreserved
communication with you the extreme resemblance
 your persons increased my gratification you were his
picture his speaking image while i looked at you i
said e such once was my charles before he was the great
man the gallant soldier the accomplished cavalier the
adored object that now engrosses my affections beside i
knew that charles loved you as much as he did any man on
earth and that knowledge made you dear to me you
 travels st leon
were constantly eager to dwell upon and describe his excellences
 could i fail to be pleased with your conversation 
i own that the pleasure i took in it was unbounded and
the emotions it awakened in my affectionate heart delicious
but all this candidly explained was only an additional
proof the tenderness and constancy my earliest attachment

and now ever since the fatal day in which this conversation
passed with my charles he is absent from court
and i know not whither he is gone he has disdained to
seek any further explanation nor do i know how to appeal
to his calmer feelings and more deliberate mind one
thing however i had determined on and that was henry
strictly to avoid your society
i trust wherever my charles is he will hear this
i owe this expiation to his agonised feelings and to the
appearances that in some degree justify his misconstruction
i will wait patiently till the simplicity and singleness 
my conduct have cleared my faith if i should otherwise
have found pleasure and relief in your society i will make
a merit with myself sacrificing this to the apprehensive
delicacy my charles's mind in this single instance
your importunity has prevailed with me to dispense with
my rule you were not to blame and i thought upon more
mature reflection that i owed you an explanation but
henceforth if you have any kindness for me or value for
him who has acted and felt towards you like a brother i
must entreat you to cooperate with me in this and that
whether in public or private we may bestow no notice on
each other and avoid all opportunities communication
to persuade you to this was indeed a principal inducement
with me so far to deviate from the rule i had laid down to
myself as to admit this conversation
i was extremely affected with the unhappiness pandora
i exerted myself to console her i promised that
nothing on my part should be wanting to remove every
shadow doubt that hung upon her fidelity and i exhorted
her to believe that every thing would infallibly terminate
in the way most honourable arid gratifying to herself
pandora listened to me and dried her tears the contravels
op st leon '
sensation was interesting and soothing to us both we
regarded it as the last unreserved and sympathetic communication
we should ever have with each other it insensibly
grew longer and longer and we knew not how to put
an to it we were still in this state irresolution
when looking up i perceived charles danville approaching
from the further the walk that led to the alcove
i would have withdrawn i was anxious to remove the
unjust suspicion that hung upon his mind but the instant
that presented to him so strong an apparent confirmation 
them the instant that by so doing must have worked up his
soul into tumult did not appear a favourable one for explanation
to withdraw was impossible pandora had
discerned her lover at the same moment with myself she
was seized with a faintness she would have sunk to the
ground but i caught her in my arms i rested with one
knee on the earth her head was reclined on my bosom
charles approached with a quicker pace
 c rise said he this is beyond my hopes i left pres
burg with the purpose not revisiting it for years but
as i proceeded further and further from a place which had
lately been the centre my affections i began to doubt
whether i had not acted with precipitation and to believe
that there was yet some uncertainty hanging on my fate
the seemingly earnest protestations this delusive syren
rung in my ears mechanically without any formed resolution
i changed my course and returned on my steps
my doubts are now at an i find you taking instant
advantage my absence to throw yourselves into each
other's arms the feelings i so lately uttered in your presence
pandora would have kept you apart if my feelings
had been in the least sacred in your eyes if all my surmises
had not been too true he took by the hand the
weeping pandora and led her to the seat which a little
before she had quitted
why all this artifice why all this deceit it is said
that we are not masters our own hearts and that no
human passion is formed to endure for ever influenced
by these maxims i could have pardoned your inconstancy
too fair too fickle pandora but why strain every nerve
 travels op st leon
to make me believe you still retained a passion you had
discarded to subject me to the lingering torture deceit
instead communicating to me a truth agonising indeed
to human frailty but calculated to inspire fortitude and
decision this i cannot excuse this racks me with the
bitterest disappointments disappointment in the virtues
i had ascribed to you and convinces me that you are
neither worthy me nor worthy happiness
and you too d'aubigny you have acted a part in this
unworthy plot i rescued you from prison from a dungeon
from which a few hours before you had no hope 
coming forth alive i took you under my protection when
you had no friend i placed you next myself i conceived
for you the affection a brother loved you next in
degree to the mistress my soul in return for all that
i have done and all that i felt for you you have with
insidious heart and every base disguise seduced from me the
woman my choice why not frankly and ingenuously
have demanded her at my hands the heart is free 
your reciprocal passion though i might have regretted it
i should have been unable to blame it is the cloak that
you have drawn over it that proves the baseness its
origin do you think i had not the courage cheerfully
and without a murmur to resign to you this illustrious fair
one i feel that i was worthy to be openly treated had
i seen in you a mutual and ingenuous passion i would not
have been the bar to its just consummation i would not
have sought the person a woman whose heart in spite
perhaps her better resolutions was given to another i
should loathe myself for ever were i capable such a part
it was the sympathetic sentiment towards me beating in
accord to the sentiment my own bosom that i once saw
in pandora and not either her peerless beauties or the excellences
i imputed to her mind that formed the mastercharm
which fascinated my soul i feel that i had the
force in the negation my own happiness to have drawn
comfort and compensation from the happiness two creatures
i so dearly loved as d'aubigny and pandora
s
i sought to interrupt my son i could no longer bear to
see him involved in so painful an error and not exert every
nerve to rescue him from it but his passions were
wrought higher than mine he would not suffer me to
speak
be silent d'aubigny i cannot brook to be interrupted
now my heart is full and i must have leave to
utter the sentiments that agitate and distend it
he advanced towards pandora he took hold her
hand
rise madam i shall not long trouble you with the
boisterous impetuousness my passions do not resist me
now 
she rose and followed him her face still covered with
her handkerchief and drowned in tears he led her to the
front the alcove he motioned me to approach with
his other hand he took hold mine he seemed to lift
pandora's hand to his lips as if to kiss it with a sudden
start he put it down again he held it below the level 
his breast
during this scene pandora and myself were speechless
most women in the situation pandora would i suppose
have spoken and have been eager to vindicate themselves
from so groundless an imputation but what she did was
peculiar to the delicacy and defencelessness her personal
character she was overwhelmed and incapable effort
for my own part my feelings were uncommonly complicated
my apparent situation was a plain one the situation
 a youth mistaken by his friend for the seducer the
mistress that friend and had my feelings been merely
relative to this situation i could undoubtedly have spoken
without embarrassment but with this were involved the
sentiments originating in my secret character the sentiments
 a man anxious to benefit and who had devoted
himself to the interests another a father tremblingly
alive to the happiness his son and eager to dive into his
soul that he might the more sensibly admire his virtues
and with a more enlightened skill secure his fortune i was
silent charles de damville proceeded 
fc thus said he i join your hands thus i withdraw
 travels st leon
all my claims upon pandora thus i remove every impediment
to your wishes this pandora this d aubigny
i was capable if you had treated me honourably and
avowed an honest passion you do not know charles de
damville you have treated me as none but the most
groveling soul could deserve to be treated had you been
ingenuous i should have a consolation in what i am doing
that now i cannot have i can no longer persuade myself
that i am joining two worthy hearts to each other i can
no longer relieve the bitterness my own disappointment
by the image your future felicity may i be mistaken 
may you be truly happy in each other you cannot be
happy beyond the wishes formed in your favour by him
who will remember to the latest hour his existence how
much his heart was devoted to you both
saying this he burst away from us abruptly and disappeared
at first as i listened to the heroic language 
my son i asked myself whether it were the expression 
a warm heart or a cold one it costs nothing to a cold
heart to ape the language heroism and to pretend to
make the greatest sacrifices when its constitution has rendered
all effort unnecessary to the feat but i looked in
the face charles and forgot my doubts his voice he
had indeed wound up to the tone his speech it was a
little tremulous but in the main firm serious deliberate
and elevated but his countenance was the picture distress
there sat enthroned defying all banishment and
disguise the anguish his soul his eye was haggard 
his complexion was colourless and wan he had been absent
several days from presburg his appearance told me
that he could scarcely either have eaten or slept during the
period his absence he might talk the generosity
with which he could resign pandora i read in his face
what that resignation had cost and would go on to cost
him ingenuous noblehearted charles i doubted whether
but for a reverse the events he apprehended he
would be able to survive it
he had no sooner left us than i applied myself to comfort
pandora i swore to her that in spite every temporary
cloud i would yet witness the union her and her
travels st leon 
adored chevalier i assured her that i would not rest till
i had forced damville to hear me and compelled him to
credit the sincerity my tale
how many things were there that in the scene which
had just passed i might have urged in answer to damville
but respecting which my situation imposed upon me the
most rigorous silence i might have said you call yourself
my protector my benefactor my patron the real relation
between us is the reverse the picture you have
drawn i want not your protection j i am qualified if i
please to be a patron to all the world i am meditating
the most generous things in your behalf this perfidious
friend as you deem him has devoted all his thoughts and
postponed all his gratifications that he might prove himself
substantially arid in the most important particulars your
friend
more than this i might have said i might have said
 i am your father i have no inclinations no passions contravening
your gratification i love you with more thana
father's love i transfer to you all the affection i entertained
for your peerless murdered mother all my study
is your happiness you are to me the whole world and
more than the whole world extensive and singular as are
my prerogatives i fold them up i forget them all and
think you alone
i cannot give a stronger proof than is contained in what
i have here stated the misery my condition i was
cheated as i have once before remarked with the form 
a man but had nothing the substance i was endowed
with the faculty speech but was cut off from its proper
and genuine use i was utterly alone in the world separated
by an insurmountable barrier from every being my
species no man could understand me no man could
sympathise with me no man could form the remotest guess
at what was passing in my breast i had the use words 
i could address my fellowbeings i could enter into dialogue
with them i could discourse every indifferent
thing that the universe contained i could talk everything
but my own feelings this and not the dungeon 
 travels st leon
bethlem gabor is the true solitude let no man after
me pant for the acquisition the philosopher's stone 
charles de damville had again left presburg the very
instant he quitted the alcove when i inquired for him
in the palace i received this afflicting intelligence i did
not hesitate a moment in resolving that i would pursue
his steps it was the utmost consequence that i should
overtake him all that was most interesting to me hung
upon our interview the preparations however my
journey though followed with ardour inevitably reduced
me to the being some hours in the rear my son i was
continually in his track but could not come up with him 
to judge from events you would have supposed that he had
as strong a motive to fly as i had to pursue he led me
along the course the danube to the source that farfamed
and munificent river
i reached the passage the rhine and was on the point
 crossing into alsace but here i lost all notice charles 
no enquiry i could make was effectual to procure me the
slightest intelligence he had not crossed the river he
had proceeded neither to the right nor the left along its
banks i was disappointed mortified and distressed what
was i to do next could i return to pandora what
tale must i relate to this adorable creature whom i had
urged to depend upon my exertions could i leave her
however to the anguish and uncertainty that must follow
upon her hearing no more either from her lover or myself 
i think i never felt more truly depressed than in this
conjuncture most amply most critically did the curse 
the opus magnum attend upon my projects and render all
my exertions abortive it was the same whether my plans
were formed upon a larger or a smaller scale when i
endeavoured to live in total obscurity in madrid when i
undertook to be the steward and the father the people 
hungary and now that with a chastised ambition i sought
what is permitted to all other human creatures to provide
for the honourable settlement my only son still still my
evil genius pursued me and blasted every concern in which
i presumed to interfere i had intruded between two faithful
lovers unfortunate they had been indeed and consign
 st leon 
durable obstacles were interposed to their felicity but
obstacles are commonly found to yield to firmness and constancy
 and without my fatal interference charles and
pandora would one day have been happy if by adverse
fates they had hitherto been kept asunder still they understood
each other and rejoiced in their mutual confidence
and attachment this the consolation all their sorrows
and disappointments it was mine to have destroyed the
globe for aught i knew would speedily be interposed between
them and here i stood in the middle point like one
 those invincible repulsive powers hid in the storehouse
 nature forbidding to them all future retrogression to each
other
chapter xlvii
the picture which my distracted fancy thus set before the
eye my mind was not altogether verified in the event
after a thousand fruitless inquiries and perquisitions i
found to my utter astonishment that charles arresting
his career at the town fribourg had returned upon his
steps and sought a second time the metropolis austrian
hungary this was the class those events which we
sometimes meet with in the world that baffle all calculation
and strike us like magic or like madness in their
authors
i had nothing to do as i conceived on this occasion
but to follow the example my son and like him to resume
the route presburg i yet hoped to witness if not to
cooperate in the reconciliation charles and pandora
my spirits in this respect were revived and my prospects
made brighter by the thoughts that these virtuous and
meritorious lovers were at last likely to be once again inclosed
within the cincture the same city add to which
my venetian confederate had not yet made his appearance
at presburg and not only was i under engagements to
give him the meeting there but it was also clear that his
hh 
 travels st leon
errand could not be brought to its proper close without my
assistance
i once more entered the city to which pandora owed
her birth charles de damville had preceded my arrival
several days i should without delay have repaired to his
apartments but that i found at my own lodgings a letter
from benevento cabriera venice informing me that he
was now in presburg and to avoid all cause for suspicion
had taken up his residence in a remote quarter the
town from the enquiries i made i became satisfied
that my son had in some degree resumed his usual occupations
and that there was no appearance his again immediately
quitting the metropolis i therefore felt my transaction
with cabriera more urgent than an immediate
conference with charles though i had sought that conference
with earnest expedition yet i dreaded it it might
require the maturest consideration and the nicest management
to render it effectual for the purposes i sought i
found from certain intelligence that damville and pandora
had yet had no explanation with each other i therefore
regarded my exertions for that purpose as a final effort 
and i was willing that every thing should be in train and
the portion pandora fully adjusted before i entered
upon that interesting scene with cabriera i had little
difficulty the documents and evidences his tale we
had concerted at venice and i presently found that he
told his story so plausibly and supported it so consistently
that it was admitted by every one without the smallest
suspicion
no sooner had cabriera opened his business to the parties
to whom the cognisance it most properly belonged
than i once more presented myself to the beautiful and engaging
niece nadasti the instant i entered her apartment
i was shocked with the extreme change her personal
appearance all the airiness alertness and vivacity
that had once so exquisitely adorned her were gone the
roses in her cheek were faded and had given place to a delicate
but sickly paleness her arms though always what
is called white had before been round and had been distinguished
by the purest hue health they were now
travels op st leon 
emaciated skinny and colourless her eyes were hollow
and her eyelids inflamed with weeping all these changes
had taken place in about five weeks that had elapsed since
i saw her last i was so struck with the sight that involuntarily
started and could scarcely command myself
enough to refrain from tears it was plain that she carried
an arrow in her bosom which one hand only in the
universe could extract with safety as i approached she
raised her lovely head that had been depressed with grief
and lifted her white arms with an expression despair
ff come nearer my sweet henry said she i rejoice
to see you though you have proved my worst enemy the
destroyer my peace but your intentions my kind boy
my brother for such i will still call you have always been
good and innocent but ah henry you have deluded
me you urged me to banish despair and every day i see
more reason to despair 
i asked if she had not seen the chevalier since his return
to presburg
it were better for me replied pandora e if i had
not seen him what has really happened is worse than if
i had been denied to see him i have met him every day
in the apartments my aunt to an indifferent eye it
would have appeared as if he neither sought nor avoided
me he carries himself towards me with a cold and constrained
civility but he neither demands an interview
nor allows me the opportunity to utter a word to him in
private oh d'aubigny i see too well that i have lost
him for ever when he fled my presence when he resolved
to seek some distant region cruel as that conduct was it
convinced me that was some importance to him but
now he passes by me in stern neglect he has utterly driven
me from his heart indeed my brother this last blow is
too much i feel that i shall never recover it
and does the chevalier cried i appear at his ease
does he exhibit the wonted symptoms his health and
triumphant spirit
f away too pleasing deluder replied pandora
c cheat me not with false hopes flatter me not with unreal
expectations damville does not appear to be well or
 travels st leon
happy but you have deceived me too much the disappointments
that you prepared for me are too excruciating
i feel now at no time so high a degree gloomy satisfaction
and composure as when i press despair firmly to
my breast
but you henry continued she are probably uninformed
 my last and severest misfortune i had a great
uncle in the list the adventurers that achieved the conquest
 peru he has died and unexpectedly bequeathed mea
fortune that sets the portionless pandora upon a level with
the wealthy heiresses the great palatine himself for a
long time want fortune was the only obstacle that stood
between me and all my hopes happiness now that
poverty is no longer an evil to me and wealth no longer
desirable i have obtained this unwelcome acquisition
you can have no conception how painful a sensation is
produced by this mockery the gift ample possessions to
the votary despair
i endeavoured somewhat to encourage pandora but she
obstinately rejected my soothing i was the less importunate
on this subject as since the return my son i
persisted to persuade myself that i should soon have something
more substantial to offer her on his part than mere
guesses and conjectures the day after this conversation
i boldly sought the presence the chevalier till then
i had since our return to presburg avoided to meet him
i now resolved to force from him a hearing to assure
him with the most solemn asseverations my own innocence
and the constancy his mistress to represent to
him in how eminent a degree the newly acquired estate 
pandora was calculated to facilitate their mutual wishes 
and finally to offer him any pledge he should desire the
sincerity my declarations even to the banishing myself
from the presence and intercourse him and the lovely
pandora for ever
when i saw my son his appearance and air advanced
a forcible claim on my compassion i will not now describe
them suffice it that they completely proved how
true was the sympathy even to the minutest particulars
between him and his mistress the difference was only in
travels st leon
kind and not in degree hers a defenceless a delicate and
truly feminine grief while his amidst all its aggravations
had something in it the champion and the hero when
he felt most severely he seemed to disdain himself for
what he felt and though his struggles were excruciating
he resolutely smoothed his manly front and the loftiness
 his spirit produced on his cheek a generous and a settled
blush
i have just said that i had resolved to force from him a
hearing i was mistaken in my calculations on this point
dejected as his habits had lately been he no sooner saw
me than he advanced towards me with a fierce and imperative
demeanour that absolutely startled me
f how is it man cried he that you are at this
hour oat custody 
custody interdicted and astonished repeated i
yes custody if such a wretch as thou art be permitted
to go at large what human institution what human
possessions shall ever be secure 
good god said i what am i to understand by
your present rage know that you have considered meas
your personal enemy and the underminer your happiness
but when first you accused me this crime you
treated me in a manner less violent and disdainful than
that which you now employ
i brook not to explain read that letter i received
it at fribourg that letter brought me back from the confines
 france to the spot where now we meet
i took up the letter its contents were nearly as follow

t my dear friend you will permit me to call you
so since to me and me only you have recently thought
proper to confide your projects and your unfortunate passion
for the charming pandora what you related to me
on the subject convinced me how much she was unworthy
 your love and how basely she has conducted herself
towards you yet you will yourself feel some compassion
for her when you learn who it is upon whom she has 

 travels op st leon
stowed this unmerited preference know then that this
wretched d'aubigny is no other than the notorious cotillon
the infamous impostor who by his machinations
about a year ago preserved the turkish provinces hungary
from being conquered by the christian arms the
man is moreover a magician the pretended or real possessor
 the philosopher's stone he is therefore doubly
worthy death first as a traitor the abettor and comforter
 the common enemy the christian faith and
secondly as a dealer in the black art and a man notoriously
sold and delivered over to the devil
 i have received this information from the most unquestionable
authority a soldier in my old corps who has
lately escaped from a turkish prison no sooner saw him
than he identified his person i happened to be near the
fellow at the moment when by an unexpected exclamation
he betrayed his discovery it immediately struck me that
the circumstance might be importance to your interests 
and therefore taking the soldier aside i charged him not
to mention to any one what he had observed to render
his secrecy the more secure i have since removed him to
a garrison at some distance from presburg and i have
myself mentioned the circumstance to no living creature
that i might first receive your instructions on the subject
and act in all respects concerning it as you shall judge
proper the blackness the character the man sets all
exaggeration at defiance this very individual whom you
liberated from the bowels the earth who by the most
treacherous arts won your confidence and upon whom you
lavishly heaped every imaginable distinction was all the
while conscious to himself that he was the character that
 all that live you hated most in one word the renegado
chatillon he acted consistently with his preceding conduct
and his recent disingenuousness when he seduced
from you the affections the woman your choice
i am concerned to add that on the very day that i
made this discovery this chatillon d'aubigny disappeared
from presburg nor can i by any effort learn whither he is
gone it is impossible he should have been informed by any
human means the detection that had happened but indeed
travels st leon 
it is vain to attempt to form any reasonable conjecture respecting
a character so mysterious and inexplicable
your devoted friend
andrew count bather
fc well sir seeing i had finished the perusal and
what have you now to allege when i saw you simply as
the favoured lover pandora however treacherous and dishonourable
i might deem your conduct towards me i quitted
the field i did not trust myself to be a judge in my own
cause i did not confide in my estimate your unworthiness
when i was myself wholly concerned i had
some time before received an invitation from the duke
d'aumale who was collecting a number generous and
highspirited nobles to accompany mary queen scots
to the barbarous fields her native realm i at first declined
i now accepted the invitation i set out for paris
to join him i found that letter waiting my arrival at fribourg
and i returned deeply as pandora has sunk in
my esteem i determined i would never allow her to be
thrown away upon the infamous chatillon
fc you haunt my steps i heard you again and again
on my route as i returned from fribourg i arrive at
presburg and presently after you again make your appearance
what further villanies have you to act what new
treacheries have you devised against me this morning i
consented to the representations count bather and agreed
that you should be delivered up to justice why then are
you not in custody 
e when i consider the mystery and inscrutableness 
your character i am lost in conjecture you are said to bea
magician a dealer in the unhallowed secrets alchymy
and the elixir mice in cases like this all the ordinary
rules human sagacity and prudence are superseded the
wisest man is a fool and the noblest spirit feels the very
ground he stood on struck from under his feet how can
i know that the seduction pandora's affections is not
owing to magical incantations who in that case is rather
an object for compassion than for censure how can i tell
that the fraternal resemblance borne by your features to
 travels op st leon
my own and the sudden and ardent partiality that rose in
my breast when first i saw you have not been produced by
the most detested arts magic dissolves the whole principle
and arrangement human action subverts all generous
enthusiasm and dignity and renders life itself loathsome
and intolerable
this is to me the most painful all subjects i had a
father whom i affectionately loved he became the dupe 
these infernal secrets i had a mother the paragon the
creation that father murdered her all the anguish i
ever felt has derived its source from alchymy and magic
while the infamous chatillon thus stands before me i feel
all the longforgotten wounds my heart new opened and
the blood bursting afresh from every vein i have rested
and been at peace and now the red and venomed plague
that tarnished the years my opening youth returns to
blast me begone infamous thricedamned villain and
let me never see thee more 
wretch that you are continued charles for he saw
me motioning to withdraw i felt that all further expostulation
and discussion on my part was useless wretch
that you are what is it that you are about to do think
no to escape my vengeance in the midst all the tumultuous
passions you waken in my breast i still feel in
myself the soldier and the man honour i am not a thieftaker
or a bailiff you are within my power and that is
your present protection i will not now deliver you up to
the justice the state but will hurl against you my personal
defiance i am willing to meet you man to man i
thirst to encounter you as my worst and most mortal foe
who has perpetrated against me the basest injuries and excited
in my bosom the most hateful sensations though
you were fenced with all the legions hell i fear you not 
and seeing that after all that is past you have once again
intruded into my presence i here bind myself by all that is
sacred to pursue you to the death
what could i answer to such an attack i saw at once
that the case as to all future harmony between me and my
son was desperate and irremediable what hope could i
entertain further what had hitherto been the result 
travels st leon 
our illfated intercourse every offence and prejudice that
can gall the human mind had been brought forward in it in
turn i had wounded damville in the most sensible point
 private life and had blasted his hopes there where he
stored them all i had offended his most rooted political
prepossessions by aiding the turk and feeding a nation
that perished with hunger i was an equivocal character
assuming different names and wandering over the world
with different pretences last all i had revived in his
mind the images his father and his mother all that had
once been most dear and now was most painful to his recollection
 and had tortured his fancy with nameless horrors
these sentiments could never be removed all the explanations
in the world could never reconcile me to his mind 
and i felt that i had that within which in what was to
come as it had in what was past must for ever annihilate
all confidence between us at once therefore i accepted his
challenge arranged with him the terms a hostile encounter
on the following morning and immediately after bid
adieu to presburg and to the sight every soul contained
within its walls for ever
this is i powerfully feel the last adventure that i shall
ever have the courage to commit to writing a few minutes
more and i will lay down my pen and resolve in the most
solemn and sacred manner never to compose another line
indeed all other adventures must necessarily be frigid and
uninteresting compared with that which i have now described
great god what a fate was mine anxious as
i had been to prove myself in the most momentous respects
the benefactor my son dismissing all other thoughts and
cares from my mind journeying with this sole object in
view from presburg to venice and from venice to
presburg from hungary to the banks the rhine and
from the banks the rhine back again to hungary
the whole scene was now terminated by a declaration on his
part that nothing could appease the animosity he cherished
against me short rioting in the blood his father's
heart i was reduced to the necessity either lifting my
sword against my son running myself upon the point 
his weapon or forfeiting the engagement between us
 travels op st leon
and suffering him to brand me as a coward in the face 
christendom i mention not this because the variety 
objects choice produced in me the slightest hesitation
weary as i was life i could cheerfully have consented
to die but not to stain the sword charles de damville
with my vital blood i prevented him from being the assassin
 his father's life could not prevent him from
being the assassin his father's character he was assiduous
and indefatigable in spreading against me the blackest
invectives which he regarded as the most unerring truths
all hungary has resounded for thirty years with the atrocities
 the sieur de chatillon what is here recorded contains
the whole and unvarnished truth on the subject
this narrative however shall never see the light till the
melancholy hour when charles de damville shall be no
more
yet in the midst the anguish the disappointment 
every cherished hope which rends my soul i have one
consolation and that an invaluable one in the virtues the
glory and the happiness my son i said i would forget
every gratification and sentiment my own in him i am
now more than ever instigated to do so when i quitted
presburg i left cabriera behind me in that city and i
took care to obtain a parting interview with him he
afterwards gave me the meeting as we then concerted at
trieste in the duchy carniola it happened as i had
flattered myself the event would prove that the visible
source umbrage being removed charles and pandora in
no long time came to a mutual understanding and were
finally made happy in each other i had been the fortunate
means supplying to this excellent and incomparable
creature the only defect under which she laboured a want
 fortune her uncle having no longer a pretence to
oppose their mutual passion united their hands and at
the time which i am speaking they were regarded as
the most graceful and accomplished couple in the whole
hungarian dominions the chevalier de damville is considered
in that country as the great bulwark the christian
frontier and the most generous and illustrious pupil in
the school the bayards and the scanderbeg cabriera
travels st leon 
worn out with years and fatigues but still grasping and
avaricious to his latest hour expired in my arms in the
city trieste and by his death yielded me this contentment
that henceforth the only obvious means for detecting
my beneficent fraud in securing the dower pandora was
for ever removed
that the reader may enter the more fully into my sentiment
 congratulation upon the happiness my son
and rise from the perusal my narrative with a more
soothing and pleasurable sensation i will here shortly recapitulate
the good qualities that had been unfolded in this
truly extraordinary young man from his earliest infancy
he was a child only nine years age at the period the
truly affecting and exemplary behaviour the reader may remember
him to have displayed while i was at paris squandering
the property my family at the gamingtable in
the alienation mind produced in me by that dreadful
catastrophe he was my constant attendant my careful
nurse and my affectionate friend when twelve months
after we were driven by our calamities out switzerland
and i lay extended to all human appearance on the bed 
death charles was the comforter his mother the friend
 his sisters and even young as he was contributed to the
maintenance my starving family by the labour his infant
hands at dresden as yet no more than seventeen
years age he was assailed by one the severest trials
with which the mind man can in any case be beset but
he hesitated not a moment obliged to choose between
poverty and innocence with the sacrifice all his habitudes
and the loss every friend on the one side and
wealth new to his enjoyment with ignominy or an equivocal
character on the other his determination was instant
and unalterable cast at so immature an age alone and
portionless upon the world he almost immediately by his
gallantry his winning qualities and his virtues gained to
himself a friend in one the greatest captains the age
unaided by the brilliancy family or fortune he acquired
the character the bravest soldier in hungary where all
were brave this last trial to which i had been the undesigning
means subjecting him was none the least
travels st leon
arduous love often entails imbecility on the noblest 
mankind but charles surmounted the most perilous attacks
 this allconquering passion when he thought
pandora unworthy he tore himself from her and would
not admit a struggle when he believed she loved another
he disdained to claim a heart that seemed alienated from
him and himself joined the hands his mistress and his
rival he might have died he could not disgrace himself
i was the hero's father but no i am not blinded by
paternal partiality but no he was indeed what i thought
him as near the climax dignity and virtue as the frailty
 our nature will admit his virtue was at length crowned
with the most enviable reward the earth has to boast
the faithful attachment a nobleminded and accomplished
woman i am happy to close my eventful and somewhat
melancholy story with so pleasing a termination whatever
may have been the result my personal experience 
human life i can never recollect the fate charles and
pandora without confessing with exultation that this busy
and anxious world ours yet contains something in its
stores that is worth living for
