saw and manytimes they hoped that cottages which at adistance peeping between trees lookedcharming would be theirs till on a nearern view they were as often contented to letthem pass one with a honeysuckle porchand another with a trellis and another witha pomegranate in full flower lucy howeverlooked back with regret fearing thattheirs could never be so pretty theirswas to be on the sea shore but as yet theydid not seem to be near the sea presentlythey turned into a lane which led down avol iii bsteep hill with hedges so high on eachside that nothing could be seen but thenarrow road before them at the bottomof this lane to the right there was a gateand a road leading through a woodharry's father stopped the carriage andasked an old woman who came to thegate is this the road to rupert's cottage yes siri am glad of it thought hany wearesure of a wood that is one good thingthe gate opened and they drove innow we shall see what sort of a placeit is said lucyrupert's cottage was at the foot of a highhill covered with trees which sheltered itat the back in front was a very smallgreen lawn surrounded with evergreensthe cottage had a honeysuckle porch anda bow window and a trellis the outsidewas all that lucy desired and within within it was an odd kind of house withone long matted passage and steps uphere and down there and rooms that hadbeen enlarged with jutting windows andniches and nooks in curious ways andlucy liked it all the better for not being aregular house the rooms in which sheand harry were to sleep if rooms theycould be called were very very smallas even lucy observed there was but justspace for a little bed and a little table anda little chair and for a little person to turnaboutin no chest of drawers or anysuch luxury only a press in the corner cutin the wall but the more difficulties themore inconveniences the better there wouldbe more work for ingenuity in contrivinghow to settle themselves and their ooodslucy wanted to have the trunks broughtin and to go to the unpacking and arrangingdirectly but harry had other thoughtsin his headlucy said he i am disappointed inone thing and a great thingwhat my dear harry said lucyopening her eyes widethe sea said harry looking out ofthe window no view of the sea anywhere i thought the cottage was to beon the sea shoreand so it was but the sea was hiddenfrom the view of the windows of the houseby a sand bank which had been thrown upby the tide and which was now coveredby a plantation of evergreens harry persuadedlucy to put off unpacking theirtrunk till morning and to go out with himin search of the sea he led the way andas theywent round the little haven she delightedwith the new place and with everynew flower and shrub would have oftenstopped to admire oh harry look atthis myrtle taller than i am oh harrythis myrtle taller than mamma harry looked back but ran on to findthe way down to the sea shore this isthe way this is the way he shouted joyouslyto lucy bidding her follow follow follow but suddenly he stopped and was silentstruck by the first sight of the oceanlucy followed and turning abruptly thecorner of the rock which had hid theview from her exclaimed the sea theseashe stood for some moments in silencebeside her brother looking at the vast extentof water far as her sight could reachbounded only by the sky they were nowstanding on the sands of the shore it wasa still evening the tide was ebbing thesun setting and there was a long brightlight upon the water while the green andwhite waves curling gently over eachother moved on continuallyhow beautiful it is exclaimed lucyhow grand harry is not it more beautifuland grander than you expected isnot it harryinfinitely said harry but hushi want to look and to listen to itlucy stood beside her brother a littlewhile longer and then ran back to thehouse to call her mother to look at it beforethe red sun should be quite set hermother came and they found harry stillon the same spot fixed in admiration hismother seemed to know what he felt andthought and to sympathise with him justas he wished at first in silence then expressingfor him in words that for whichhe could not find utterance the ideas ofboundless extent duration power thefeelings of admiration astonishment andawe which create the sense of the sublimewhile his soul was under this strong impressionhis mother seized the proper momentto raise his thoughts still higher fromthe ideas of immeasurable extent durationand power to that power by which theocean the sun the earth and we ourselveswere created and are preservedthe impression made on the minds ofharry and lucy was never effacedby sunrise next morning harry was onthe sea shore at the stated hours he wasconstantly there to watch the coming inand going out of the tide this regularebbing and flowing of the sea excited suchastonishment in his mind that it seemedinsatiable a fisherman who lived by thesea side asked him if he had never beforeheard of the coming in and going out ofthe tide every dayyes i had heard of it but i never saidit before said harry that was quite anotherthingthe sea and the tides took such possessionof his imagination that he could thinkof nothing else not even of steam boats orsteam engines during the first day hedid not even think of crossing the sea in asteam vessel he was completely absorbedin viewing this great spectacle of natureand in considering its wonderful phenomenahis mother was surprised to find thathe was susceptible of this kind of enthusiasmof which she had not till now seen inhim any symptom all his enthusiasmhad seemed to be for mechanics his mindhad indeed opened during his travels toother objects but still these had been introducedor had interested him by theirconnection with the steam engine to whichhe had traced every thing good or greatso that as she had once told his fathershe was afraid that harry's head wouldbe quite turned by his dear steam engineor at best that it would leave noroom in his imagination for the beautiesof nature or for any thing else but hisfather had answered that there was nodanger in letting the boy's enthusiasm takeits course especially as it was a means ofcollecting all the knowledge he could uponone subject his father said it was oflittle consequence to which science hefirst turned his attention the same thirstfor knowledge when satisfied on one pointwould turn to new objects the boy whowas capable of feeling such admiration forthe ingenious works of art could not failas he thought to admire with still greaterenthusiasm the beauties of nature hewould have probably disliked them if theyhad been pressed upon his attention andyet he would have felt pain from not beingable to sympathise with the admiration ofhis friends his father was justified mhis opinion and his mother was now quitesatisfiedbut on the evening of the day after theirarrival lucy came to harry with no faceof rejoicing oh my dear hany here you arestanding on the sea shore looking at thetide very happily but you do not knowwhat a misfortune has happened to you what misfortune can have happenedto me without my knowing it saidharryi have been unpacking our trunksaid lucythe glass of my camera obscura isbroken i suppose said harryyou suppose so calmly cried lucyperhaps it can be mended saidharryimpossible said lucy come andlook at it my dear harry it is broken intoa hundred piecesthen there is no use in looking at thehundred pieces said harryb but if you will come in and look atit said lucy i can show you just how it happenedi cannot help it now said harry soitdoes not much signify to me how it happenedi will look at it when i go in buti want to stay here just to see how highthe waves come at full tidei am glad your head is so full of thetide harry said lucy i was afraidthat you would be excessively vexed as iwas when i opened the box and saw it besidesi was afraid that you would think itwas my fault no i could not be so unjust saidharry i remember how carefully youpacked it and how goodnatured you wereabout it and i do not forget your shellbox which you left at home to make roomfor my camera obscura now i am sorryyou did not bring it can do without it said lucy i will make a shell box for you criedharry and i know how i can make itout of that camera obscura of mine andwithout spoiling it even if i should get anew glass i will go in and look at it andbegin directly said hairy i mean assoon as ever i have seen the tide come inand marked how high it comes up on thisrockwithinside of the box of harry's cameraobscura there was a set of hingedflaps which lay at the bottom when it wasnot used but which when it was to be usedas a camera obscura were lifted up andjoining together formed a sort of pyramidon the top of which the eye glass was fixedthis glass being broken harry clearedaway the fragments and took out the pinsfrom the hinges of the flaps which formedthe pyramid then he could take out theflaps and these with their pins and hingeshe gave into lucy's charge to take care oftill they should be wanted again thenwith the help of an old knife the only toolto be had in rupert's cottage he cut upa blue bandbox the only pasteboard to behad in rupert's cottage he carved andcut this pasteboard into a number of slipswith tolerably straight edges and thesewere to be fastened inside of his box at thebottom so as to form divisions from the middlein the shape of a large star the cornersround it filled up with other divisionsof hearts and crescents with some as lucydescribed them of no particular shapethis was the ground plan these divisionswere but half the height of the depth ofthe box over this first story there was tobe another a tray was to be made to fit inand to lie on the top of the basement storyas harry would have it called with difficultythe blue bandbox furnished sufficientpasteboard for this every scrap was requiredand some parts of its rim had beenso much bent and bruised and batteredthat they could scarcely be made fit forservice with harry's utmost care and skillwhen the work was all cut out harry setlucy to write numbers on the pieces of thestars hearts crescents and nondescriptthat each might fit rightly into its placethis he had learned he said from readingthe description of the building of the eddystonelighthouse it was a precautionhe found of great use in the present workthe first of the kind he had ever attemptedhe had no glue the cook or she whoacted as cook in rupert's cottage had notime to make paste harry howeversearched in the orchard on the cherry treesfor gum and found some which he meltedin hot water it was too thin so thinthat it would not stick his divisions togetherby his mother's advice he meltedit in vinegar with which he made an excellentcement though his fingers wereunused to this fiddlefaddle work as hethought it he persevered for lucy's sakeand for the sake of his promise it wasdifficult to make the tray fit rightly ordraw up and let down easily but he polishedaway all friction at the four cornersand he fastened tapes to the middle of eachof the four sides so automatically that itcould be drawn up without hitching andwithout dangler that when filled to thebrim with the smallest of shells it should overturn or be overturnedwhile hairy had been working at theshell tray in his oven little room lucy'shead was in all the cares and joys of arranginghis goods and her oven after thegeneral unpacking it not only requirednice arrangement to make things comfortablein the small space allotted to them intheir new abode but continual care wouldbe necessary to keep them so and nowlucy felt particularly the advantage of thosehabits of order which her mother hadtaught her even when she was a very littlegirllucy put your work into your workbagand put your work bag into its placehad not been said in vainwhen lucy had arranged her own roomshe stood contemplating her arrangementsand said to herself what a pleasure there is in seeing allthings fit nicely into their placesthis pleasure in the perception of thefitness of things has been felt probably byevery little or great lover of order as wellas by lucy besides our sense of the convenienceof having things in their placesand the expectation of finding them readilywhen wanted we feel some selfapprobationin having done our duty in puttingthem to rightslucy having finished to the best of herpower the arrangement of all her brother'sthings and her own went out to the seashoreto look for shells and numbers shefound the whole day was spent in thedelightful search and the next morning themoment breakfast was over she askedharry to come again with her to the sameamusement but he said that he had businessto do first and that he would join heras soon as he had learned his lessons lessons repeated lucy with surprisenot unfixed with disappointmentdo you intend to go on with lessonsharryyes why not i do not know answered lucy puttingon her bonnet but i thought youneed not learn them i did not knowthat we were to go on with lessons nowwe are not at home we are at home now i think saidharry this is to be our home for twomonths at leastthat is a long time to be suresaid lucy tying the strings of her bonnetbut i have not settled to any thing yet ihave no greek to learn thank goodnessi will go down to the sea shore to day atleast and you will find me there harrywhen you have done your business makehasteharry with his books under his armand lucy with her bonnet on and shelltray in her hand were turning their differentways in the matted passage whentheir mother came out of her roomwhere are you going lucy to the sea shore mamma to look forshellsher mother said that this was a pleasantamusement but reminded her thatthere were other more necessary employmentsyes tomorrow mamma i intend why not today lucy said hermother i thought it would not signify mammaif i went without lessons one day more you know i have not done any during allthe journey and in one day i could notlearn much my dear lucy said her motherwhen your father and i first thought ofbringing you with us on this journey weconsidered whether it would be of advantageor disadvantage to you thank you mamma and you said yesterdaythat you thought it had been alreadyof great use to harrytrue my dear but now i am speakingof youme only mamma said lucy whenyou said you i thought you always meantboth of usyou are not quite so steady in perseveranceas your brother and i was afraidthat seeing a great number of new thingsand being with a number of new peoplemight be of disservice to youbut i hope you do not think i amspoilt at all yell mammas said lucyi cannot tell yet my dear said hermother smiling that remains for you toshow me your father thought as he toldme that i might trust to the habits of regularlyemploying yourself which you havelately acquired or resumed and to the influenceof your brother's example i shallnot have it in my power to attend to youhere so much as i do at home i mustride out while i am here some hours everydayfor my health and i am to bathetherefore i cannot be with you so much orhear your lessons as i used to do at regulartimesnever mind my dear mother saidlucy i will get them always regularlyyou shall see mamma that papa was rightin thinking you might trust to me and iwill follow harry's example and i willbegin today and this minute added sheuntying her bonnet i will put by myshell tray you will allow mamma thati am exact in putting by my things andbefore i went away from you mamma iwas regular in employing myself i knowthat was the reason you said resumedyou shall see mammafrom this time forward lucy at fixedhours always went to her daily employmentsor lessons as punctually as harrywent to his and performed them wellwhether her mother had leisure to attendto her or not never did lucy neglect orvoluntarily omit any of them one singleday while they remained at the sea shoreand when it was all over she declaredthat of all the pleasures the many pleasuresshe enjoyed there the reflection that shehad done this was the greatest nothingis more tiresome than to spend all day longin amusement or in trying to amuse oneselflucy after working hard and wellat whatever she knew she ought to do enjoyedwith double pleasure the succeedinghours by the sea shore hairy with complaisancewhich his lasting gratitude forthe packing his camera obscura sustainedused to help her to pick up shells but itwas not an amusement particularly to histaste and when he had stooped till hisback ached which soon happened he wentoff to refresh himself at some of his ownworks he had a bridge to build and acanal to cut and a lock to make thesewere some of the projects which he hadformed during the journey and which hewas now eager to carry into executionhe found a fine place for his canal betweentwo rivulets at some distance fromeach other his little bark might sail triumphantlyfor a length of course if hecould effect their junction he levelledand calculated and calculated and levelledbefore he dug with as much care perhapsas has been bestowed upon some greatpublic works he dug and excavated indefatigablyhis method of proceedingwas to keep the water back by a smalldam of earth till he had advanced a fewfeet he would then remove the dam andthe water which flowed in detected anyerrors that he had committed in the levelwhen the cut however had been madesome yards in length the sides in manyplaces fell in for the soil was loose andcrumbly this misfortune was easily remediedby increasing the slope of thesides but a more serious disaster befelour young engineer which obliged him torecur to his father's neverfailing advicehe had carried his work through a vein ofsand and though the sides had been properlysloped to keep them from falling inyet when he opened the dam and admitteda little water it gradually disappearedand left the canal dryhis father willingly gave his assistanceand having examined the spot and perceivingthat the sand communicated withother porous ground underneath he said this is a difficulty my dear harry whichoften occur sto older and wiser engineers andalways occasions great increase of troubleand expense i was in hopes that bysome alteration in the line of your canalthis leaky place might have been avoided but the sand is so extensive that i believeyour only resource vill be to puddle thesides and bottomhe took harry to a ditch at some littledistance in which there was abed of strongtenacious clay and he explained to himthat puddling was performed by spreadingthe clay in layers wetting it sufficientlyand then beating it into a thick pastewhich he would find was quite imperviousto water as soon as harry knew whatwas to be done he proceeded in his workwith fresh vigour and lucy assisted himin carrying the clay in small quantitiessuch as their only basket would hold theclaypaste was well mixed and rammedwith the buttend of a long club and thesides and bottom were nicely smoothedwith the back of the spade when thedam was again opened the canal wastight and firm to admiration and harryfelt not only the pleasure of successfullabour but the satisfaction of having acquiredknowledge in every step he tooklucy stood by to witness and admirethis operation in which proper femaleconsideration for her shoes and petticoatsforbade her to join but femalesympathy is often agreeable in circumstancesin which woman's aid can in noother way be given something to thiseffect but very unlike it in words harryonce said to lucy and it paid her forstanding above an hour looking onharry had examined the real lock on thecanal and understood its construction sowell that he succeeded in making his miniatureimitation the canal about two feetwide and one foot deep the lock aboutfour feet long from gate to gate the gateswere made of an old hatch door of thechicken yard which he found posts andall among a heap of rubbish in the woodhouse his father oave him leave to takepossession of it and the woodman lent hima saw with which he cut it in two acrossthe middle leaving on each half one ofthe leather straps which had served forhinges he wisely contented himself withsingle gates at each end of his lock as hewas aware that neither his skill nor histools would enable him to construct thedouble gates which meet together anglewiseso as to support each other andwhich he well remembered was the caseinthe real lock the posts he sawedin two also in the middle of theirheight but this he did without sufficientconsideration he spoiled his fourwellseasoned posts and lost a day bythis rash act he found each of them cuttoo short for the doors and sides of hislock because he had not considered thedepth to which it was necessary to drivethem into the ground to make them standfirmly and bear the weight of the doorsthat hinged upon or shut against themhe had four new posts to make and thesehe made twice as high as the others anddrove them down several inches deep intothe ground this was the hardest work ofall harry without hat or coat wieldingthe woodman's heavy axe batteredthese piles with the butt end lending hislittle soul at every stroke at every pauselucy in pity would sayharry pray do let me try now whileyou rest yourselfbut when she took up the axe shefound it was too heavy for her and herstrokes were so feeble that they did nogood the post never stirred at her hammeringnever sunk in twenty strokes a hairbreadtheach blow of hers was so uncertainin its aim that harry fearing theaxe would turn in her hands and thatshe would end by cutting off her legs besoughther to desist protesting that itmade him hotter to see her batter than tobatter himself he assured her that batteringwas too hard work for women andquite unfit for them and she being muchout of breath believed him and resignedthe ponderous axe he worked himselfinto another heat while she repeatedmany timesit will do now harry it is deepvol iii cenough down now harry i am sure thatis enoughbut harry battered on till the post wouldstir no more then he was satisfied for itwas as he said au refus de mouton au refus de mouton said lucy whatcan that mean mouton is mutton orsheep what can mutton or sheep haveto do with this harry told her that mouton is not onlythe name for mutton and sheep in frenchbut also for a battering hammer or pileengine the machine with which piles aredriven down into the ground he saidthat he met with the expression in a descriptionof the pile engine which he hadread in consequence of the old gentlemanat mr franklin's having excited his curiosityabout it by the description he gaveof the houses in amsterdam built on pileshow curious it is said lucy to seehow one thing leads to another and howone bit of knowledge sometimes in theoddest way helps us on to another thatseems to have nothing to do with it andharry think of your explaining this frenchexpression to me though i began to learnfrench so long before you and though iheard so much of it from french peopletoo when i was at aunt pierrepoint's iought to be very much ashamednot at all my dear said harry this is a scientific expression not necessaryfor a woman to knowlucy looked as if she was not surewhether she should be satisfied or dissatisfiedby this observationnot necessary for a woman to knowshe repeated to be sure it is not absolutelynecessary one could live without ityet i do not see why a woman should notknow scientific expressions as well asmenyou are very welcome to know themray dear said harry i do not makeany objection am not i teaching themto you but i hope my dear lucy youwill never use them never use them said lucyc in the wrong place i mean addedharryno danger if once i understand themrightly said lucy still you do not quite understand mesaid harry if you knew the meaningof the words ever so well there might bedanger of your using them in the wrongplaceoh harry how could that beask mamma and she can tell you betterthan i can said harrybut tell me as well as you can saidlucy then for instance said harry ifyou were to talk of au refus de moutonbefore company just to show that youknew the expression or could say it doyou understand me nowyes but i would never do such a foolishthing said lucypray do not my dear sister saidharry for it would make me feel horriblyashamedi shall never make you ashamed of mei hope brother said lucy i will takegreat care but there was another thingi was in a great hurry to say before youwent off to this why is a battering hammeror a machine for driving down postsor what do you call them piles called amouton i do not know said harryi think i have found out the reasonsaid lucyhave you said harry then you aremuch quicker than i am but that you alwaysare only about words said lucy andi am not sure that i am right but i thinkperhaps it is because sheep sometimes buttthis way with their heads i do believe you are right said harry this must be the meaning of batteringrawit never struck me till this minutebut i do not know what i shall do for wantof nails to nail these leather hinges on mygate postslucy recollected having seen some yesterdayleft sticking in the lid of a dealpacking case perhaps these would doshe ran to ask her mother if she mighthave them and soon returned with themand with a hammer which had been usedat the unpacking of the case and whichthough it belonged to the carriage toolboxher father lent her trusting to her returningit punctuallynot only quick in words but in deedssaid harry as she put the nails and hammerinto his handsthe hinges were fastened on and harrypronounced the lock to be finishedbut after all said lucy here isyour lock and your canal but where isyour boat to go upon it now you mustmake a boat or a canoe harry yoursindeed must be made out of a branch notfrom the great trunk of a tree to be inproportion to your canaltrue said harry a branch as yousay will do but what size must it be imust consider that before i ask papa to letthe woodman give it to me you might do it by the rule of three'said lucy as the great canal is to thegreat boat so must the little canal be to thelittle boatwell said harry do the sum formehere is a pencil and a bit of paperbut stay said lucy there is somethingmore we want i must have the measuresof the great canal and the little canaland the size of the great boatharry measured his little canal andgave breadth and depth to lucy whomultiplied them rightly into one anotherthe measures of the great canal and thegreat boat he did not know but his fatherestimated them for him nearly enough toanswer his purpose lucy and he workedout the sum patiently that evening andwhen he knew the size required his fathergave him an order upon the woodman forabranch or piece of a branch of the requisitedimensions he also borrowed forhim a mallet a chisel and a gouge andeven an adze which were necessary toolsfor hollowing out the solid wood and forshaping the outside of the intended canoethis last indeed is a dangerous tool andshould never be trusted without circumspectionto oung or to old hands unlessthey be skilful and careful harryboth careful and skilful for he had beenpractised in the use of this tool under hisfather's eye at home was trusted with itnow but upon special condition thatlucy was never to touch it a conditionto which lucy having just fear of hershins as well as proper habits of obediencewillingly submittedas the hollowing out this canoe chipby chip was likely to be a tedious operationlucy left harry and his adze to themselvesand went to her own amusementsupon the shelly shore as she was creepingaloncr searching for shells an old womancrossed her path carrying on her back ahuoe basket full of sea weed the woman'sfoot hit against some shingles on thebeach she stumbled and let fall herbasket the contents of which were overturnedon the sands lucy went to fill itagain for her and now seeing that she wasthe gatekeeper who lived at the entranceof the wood took hold of one of thehandles of the basket and helped her tocarry it homedame peyton for that was the old womans name thanked her and accepted heroffer more perhaps for the pleasure oftalking to the young lady on the way thanfor any use in her assistance the loadthough bulky was very light the basketwas chiefly filled with the little black bladdersof a particular kind of sea weedthese when dried and oiled she strungand sent by her daughter to the shops in atown hard by where they were made intonecklaces and bracelets for whosoever gentleor simple might chance to have a likingfor such the dame loved talking and shepursued her discourse you were lookingfor shells miss when i came by i suppose and if i may be so bold i can showyou more in an hour than you would find inaweek without me for i know where thebeds of them lie and where the sea urchinsc bide miss if ever you heard of themurchinslucy was eager to find a sea urchin andhad been searching for one in vain assoon as they reached the cottage at thegate where she lived dame peytonpointed to a shelf in her corner cupboardon which were several shells which hadbeen left there by her sailor son who hadpicked up some of them from the neighbouringsands and some from foreignpartsthe shell of the sea urchin which lucyfirst examined was about the size of anorange the shape of a turnip and dividedinto compartments like a melon the colourwas lilac jut looking as if sprinkled thicklywith little white frosted sugarplums insome of its quarters and in others perforatedwith a multitude of holes nearly assmall as pin holes the shell was as light asan empty egg shell through each of thelittle holes the urchin when alive puts outits prickles or spines which stand in all directionsround the creature's shell like theprickles of a hedgehog lucy who had readthe description of it knew that these servethe sea urchin for legs with which at thebottom of the sea it can walk as it is saidin any direction sometimes with its mouthupwards sometimes with its mouth downwardssometimes rolling along sidewayslike a wheel there was an opening atthe upper part of the shell which servedfor its mouth and another opposite to itthrough which the creature can at pleasurepush out or draw in what resemble thehorns of snails these which were formerlysupposed to have been its legs theurchin uses only to feel about wdtb whenit walks as a blind man uses a staff totouch and try every thing that lies in hiswaylucy who knew all this from her bookswas eager to see the fish alive with all itsspines about it but dame peyton's dinnerwas ready boiling over in her pot andthough the goodnatured old woman wouldhave left it to go that instant to show lucythe haunt of the urchins yet lucy wouldnot let her she waited till evening andthen harry accompanied her though ratherunwilling to lay by his adze and leavehis canoeas he went with lucy towards the appointedplace he objected to her wonderfulaccount of the urchin's mode of walkingon the spines he said that as thesecreatures were in the habit of walking onlyat the bottom of the sea few people onlythose who had gone down in a diving bellcould have observed them walking you shall see you shall see themyourself harry said lucyshe recollected what she had read thatreaumur had first seen an urchin walkingat the bottom of a shallow pan full of seawaterand at her request dame peytonhad provided one of her shallow milk pansto show the experiment they found herwaiting for them when they reached ureshe took out one from a numberof these fish which had congregatedtogether and put the apparently inanimateball into the pan full of water presentlyit sent forth some of its hundred hornsthrough the holes in its shell and soonstretching its spines it appeared with allits wiry looking prickles full upon itthirteen hundred horns and two thousandspines well countedit moves it moves now harrysee it rising up now it is putting outits feelers from beneath now look at itfeeling about like a blind man with hisstaff and now he is really beginning towalk look at him w alkino on his shineslike a wheel on its spokes how beautifullyhe goes on he is an admirable mechanic exclaimedharry look how he uses someof his spines as a fulcrum against whichhe pushes and drawls on his shell byturns i did not think any fish could haveso much senseharrys admiration increased as wellit mioht the more he considered thesethings now harry you see that even myshell hunting leads to something saidlucy you will not despise shell fishwhen you know more about them andtheir housesafter this day whenever harry wantedto rest himself from his hard labour heused to go to lucy to learn somethingmore of her shellsone day she showed him the shell of therazor fish and told him in what an ingeniousmanner the fish which inhabits thisshell can move itself forward or descendinto its sandy hole it does not walk uponspines but by means of its tongue it hasafleshy cylindrical tongue which it can useby turns as a shovel a hook a borer anda ball when it wants to go on it formsits tongue into the shape of a hook whichit strikes into the sand and by which itpulls its body after it when it wants todescend it bores a hole in the sand withits tongue sometimes two feet in depth and when it wants to ascend to the surfaceit forms the end of its tongue into theshape of a ball which stops the bottomof the hole and serves as a fulcrum andthen making an effort to extend the wholetongue pushes the shell upwards till bya repetition of this operation it gains thesurfaceof all things lucy most wished to seea barnacle not for its beauty nor for itsrarity but on account of the strange storiesshe had read concerns it she had firstmet with some account of it in a note onthe barnacle in her bewick's british birds and afterwards she had copied from someother book a whole page of its fabuloushistory she searched honor the shoremany a time in vain for a barnacle butdame peyton gave her one which hadbeen found by her sailor boy at the bottomof an old plank of a ship lucy ran withher treasure to harry and showed it tohim it looked something like a transparentwhite flexible gristle branching fromone centre or body into various arms at the end or summit of each branchthere was a small shell about the size of abean and of the shape of the bill of a largebird these arms or branches are calledpedicle or footsteps by these the fishattaches itself to rocks or to the bottomsof vessels these footsteps are sometimesof a fine red and the shells sometimesof a violet colony but now harry said she youmight guess for ever what not only foolishpeople but grave naturalists my dear whowrote books in former times believed cameout of these little shells pray guessi suppose some sort offish said harryno but a bird a goose a greatgoose said lucy out of each of thesetiny shells this was called the treebearinggoose and now let me read thisto you or read for yourself if you pleaseand can read my small hand writingharry read as follows what our eyes have seen and handshave touched we shall declare there isa small island lucy put her hand over the name of theplace and bid harry read on withoutknowing where the place was there is a small island wherein arefound the broken pieces of old bruisedships some whereof have been cast thitherby shipwreck and also the trunks andbranches of rotten trees whereon is founda certain spume or froth that in timebreadth into certain shells in shape likethose of the muscle but sharper pointedand of a whitish colour wherein is containeda thing in form like a lace of silkfinely woven together one end whereof isfastened to the inside of the shell even asthe fish of oysters and muscles are theother end is made fast unto a rude mass orlump which in time comes into the shapeand form of a bird when it is perfectlyformed the shell gapeth open and thefirst thing that appeareth is the aforesaidlace or string next come the legs of thebird hanp'ino out and as it orroweth greaterit opened the shell by degrees till atlength it is all come forth and hanoethonly by the bill in short space after itcometh to maturity and falleth into thesea where it gathered feathers and growethto a fowl bigger than a mallard lesserthan a goose which the people of lucy put her finger over the place call by no other name than a treegoose which place aforesaid and all thoseparts adjoining do so much abound withthat one of the best is bought for threespence i never heard such nonsense in mylife said harry for the truth whereof if any doubtcontinued lucy reading may it pleasethem to repair unto me and i shall satisfythem by the testimony of good witnesses good witnesses indeed said harryhe asked in what part of the world andat what time what age such nonsensecould have been believed he supposedthat it must have been in the dark agesand at novazembla or the lord knowswhere he was surprised when lucytold him that the place reputed to be thenative soil of the tree bearing goosewas in england in a small island on the coast of lancashire and that the time whengrave naturalists wrote its history was thelatter end of the days of queen elizabeth but what could have given rise to sucha strange story lucy said that there was no reasongiven but that the silky looking membranewhich hung out of the shells of the fishlook something like featherstheir mother observed that as the barnaclegoose was a bird of passage andappeared only for a short time in severewinters the country people had not meansof learning their history nor could theytell how they came there and seeing thebarnacle shells also but seldom and perhapshappening to see these also in badweather when cast ashore on shipwreckedvessels they had concluded too hastilythat one elinor was the cause of the otherbecause it appeared at the same time orjust before itlucy said this was natural for ignorantpeasants but for naturalists mamma andpeople who write great books think oftheir believing that a great goose whichweighs i have it written down hereaboutfive pounds and measures more thantwo feet in length and nearly four feetand a half in breadth came out of thislittle shell but lucy said her mother i donot think that is the incredible part of thestoryno mamma dont you indeed i do not do not the common geeseyou see every day come from an egg almostas much less than the fuuorown birdas the barnacle shell is less than the barnaclegoose that is true to be sure said lucy great birds come from small eggs we seebut then mother the wonder is that thebird should come from the shell of afish now you have it lucy cried harryand why should not that be believed said their mother oh mamma and do you really believeit cried lucyi do not recollect telling you that ibelieved it replied her mother smilingbut i asked you your reason for disbelieving unless you can give some reasonfor your belief or your disbelief you arenot wiser than the poor people you havebeen laughing atthat is perfectly true said harrybut i did not think of it till mamma saidsomy reason for not believing it saidlucy is that it is contrary to all we everheard or read of the history of birds orfishesthat is a good reason said her mother all that we know of their history isfrom observation or from reading the observationsof others and all the means wehave of judging whether any new fact wehear related be true or false must be fromcomparing it with former established factsand considering whether it agtrees withthem or notyes mamma i understand saidlucy also by considering whether itagrees or not with what are called the lawsof natureand what do you mean my dear bythe lawes of nature said her motherthe laws of nature repeated lucyto gain time oh mamma you knowwhat i mean by the laws of nature youonly ask that to puzzle meno my dear lucy i ask it onlythat you may not puzzle yourself that youmay not use words without clearly understandingtheir meaningis not the laws of nature a good expressionmamma said lucya very good expression for those whounderstand what they mean by it saidher mother but no expression can begood for those who do not to them itexpresses nothinglucy thought for some time and thensaid harry do you try you can explainit betteryou mean by the laws of nature saidharry things or circumstances whichhave been known regularly and constantlyto happen about animals and vegetablesand minerals and all things in nature icannot express it quite mother but forinstance it is a law of nature that theearth turns round every twentyfourhours yes that the sun rises every morningsaid lucy and in the same way it maybesaid to be a lave of nature mamma thatbirds do not come of fishes shellsvery vell between you you have explainedpretty nearly what is meant bythe laws of nature said their mother what from the beginning of theworld was never in any instance known tohappen we do not believe cadi happensaid harry i mean in nature andyet continued he new facts are discoveredwhich sometimes prove that whatwas thought to be quite true and a settledlaw of nature is not sobut said lucy to go back to thebarnacle goose tree harry suppose thatyou and i had lived in queen elizabeth'sdays and in lancashire and near thatisland of geese do not you think that weshould have believed in the goosetreei hope not said harry butlamnot sure suppose that a great many people hadtold you that they were sure there wassuch a tree said lucy what would youhave said then i would have asked whether they hadseen it themselves or whether they hadonly heard of it from others said harry i would have questioned the people separatelyand have observed whether theyall agreed or disagreed in their answersand above all i would have gone to theplace and would have examined the barnacleshells with my own eyes then ithink i should have perceived that whatpeople had mistaken for feathers of a birdwere the membranes or what do you callthem lucy teiitacula of a fish i wouldhave returned at different times of theyear to watch what became of the barnaclesand then i think i should have foundthe truthand i think harry said his mother that if you follow such a prudent coursein judging of extraordinary assertions youwill never be the dupe of wonders or undertakerswhenever either of youfeel inclined to believe in a wonder withoutproof pray remember the barnaclegoose and the goosetreeso long as luc had any ingenious contrivancesto show harry in her shells orany curious anecdotes to tell him of themodes of life of their inhabitants helooked and listened and was pleased but he ceased to be interested and lookeddull when she told him any of their hardnames he however admitted that thegreat classes into which shells are dividedare easy to remember and he liked theirnames univalves bivalves and mulilvalveslucy placed before him a snail shell anoyster shell and a barnacle as examples ofeach class he examined the curious constructionof the hinges of various shellsvol iii dbut farther he had no curiosity he couldnot he said understand the use of lucy'sspending so much time in settling to whatorder each shell belonged lucy hadmuch to say in favour of the use and advantagesof classification to preserve thingsin order in our memory and to assist usin recollecting them more easily but itwas not a good time to enter upon thesubject nowe because harrys head hadgone back to his boat he had finishedit and he wanted her to come out andlook at it she put aside her shells directlyand followed himthe boat it must be confessed was butaclumsy affair the few tools that harryhad were in very imperfect order but heforbore to complain because he had onceheard from lucy a french proverb unmauvais ouvrier se plaint de ses outilsa bad workman complains of his toolsimperfect as the boat was lucy viewed itwith indulgence and when harnessed to itshe towed it along respectfully and withthe greatest circumspection often lookingback to see that she did not upset or strandit by pulling it against the bank harryhowever remonstrated against her lookingback which he observed was out of characterfor a horse he told her that sheshould go steadily on with her head downand that he would take care of ail the restand guide and govern horse and boatthe boat was on the upper branch of thecanal and harry as lockman shut thelower gate so that the lock might fillbut the lock did not fill the water indeedrose a few inches but gushed outwithsad velocity between the gate postsand the sides of the lock harry stoodcalmly contemplating this disappointmentand considering how he could make goodthe defect when lucy who observed thatthe water was actually subsiding insteadof rising saidindeed harry you need not standthere looking at your posts for all thewater that was in the lock has run out i think it has found some other channeltrue replied harry we must stopd of liaup our useful dam once more and then weshall discover the fault no knowledgelike that we gain by experiencethe dam was soon stopped and whenthe lock was nearly dry harry perceivedthat the pressure of the water when it hadbegun to rise had torn away the looseearth under the gate and escaped almostas freely as if there had been no gateafter due deliberation on the best meansof obviating this unforeseen evil he resolvedto fix a sill in the bottom of thelock from post to post so that the gateshould shut tightly against itlucy said he one of those oldposts which i so awkwardly spoiled willnow be of the greatest servicetwo days were occupied in this undertakingthe sill was at last securely peggeddown to the ground and for fear of asimilar misfortune with the upper gate helaid a sill to it also to prevent theweight of water from undermining thesesills he paved the bottom of the wholelock and a small portion of the canal withlarge flat stones and the intervals betweenthe gateposts and the lock sides hepuddled with great care another happythought occurred to him he had felt thedifficulty of opening the gates when thewater was bearing against them and henow provided means for letting it off graduallyby boring two round holes in eachgate into which he fitted plugs in imitationof the sluices in the real locka satisfactory trial was made of theirwork and having ascertained that all wasright harry ran home and requested hisfather to come and see his boat ooinothrough the lock his father came andfirst it was to go down the stream whenit came within proper distance of the lockthe lower gate was closed and the sluicesof the upper gate were opened by harrywith due ceremony and with proper apologiesfor not having double gates thelock was now brim full to the level of thestream through which the boat had passedthe boat entered the gate behind it wasshut harry opened the sluice of thelower gate and by happy degrees the boatsank as the water flowed out till it camedown to the level of the lower branch ofthe canal then the lower lockgate wasopened and out was drawn the boat safelyand happilyjust as well said lucy as it wasmanaged in the real lock on the realcanalsay on the great lock on the greatcanal said harry for this is a reallock is it not father though it issmallto reward him for his perseverancehis father promised harry to provide himwith the tools necessary for the betterfinishing his boat he showed him theprincipal faults in its shape and explainedto him that the middle part of a boat orship is made broad ov full in proportion tothe kind of cargo it is intended to carry that the foremost end or bow is rounded offto a sharp edge called the stem or cutwaterin order to lessen the resistance in moving and that the stern is made very narrowunder water to allow the full impulse ofthe water to strike the ruddersoon afterwards his father took harrywith him to see a boat which was buildingat some miles distance from rupert cottagethere he learned how the ribs of a boatare put together and fastened to the keelso as to make them as strong and as lightas possible harry told lucy when hereturned that the framework of a boatbefore the boards are put in looked like theskeleton of the dead horse which they hadoften seen in a rove near their father'shouse he told her that he had heard theboatmaker and his father talking aboutship building and of some great improvementsthat had been lately madeharry could not understand much of whatthey said because he had never seen theinside of a ship besides the boatbuildertalked in workman's lanoruasre using anumber of terms that were familiar toshipwrights but not to him and taking itfor granted that every body must knowwhat he was talking of picked out however some thingsthat interested me said harry particularlysome that concern the steamvesselsthese improvements in shipbuildinghave been of great use to thempeople have learned how to put the timberstogether in such a manner as to makevessels much stronger than they were formerly so that now they can bear thestraining and wo j king of the steamenginei heard the man say that unless they hadbeen so strengthened engines of suchgreat power could not have been used in short they could not have made thesteam vessels carry so much or go so fastor so safely as they do now that is good for the steam vesselssaid lucy and for all who go in them and some time or other perhaps i shallgo in one myself but harry you saidthere were other things you heard whichinterested you what were theyoh i heard of one very ingeniousand useful invention cried harry fortaking down easily and quickly the uppermasts topmasts a they call them ofshipsupper masts topmasts repeatedlucy i do not understand what youmean i thought the mast of a ship wasall in one a great thick straight uprightpole like the stem of a treebut it is not all in one piece saidharry there is a piece put on at theupper part of the lowest mast to whichsails are hung which are called topsails and that piece is called the topmast itis often of great consequence for sailors tobe able to take down and put up the topmastsquickly as my father explained tomesometimes a topmast is broken bya high wind or a sudden squall and tillthey can replace the broken mast youknow they cannot make use of the sailthat belongs to it perhaps at that momentthe ship may be running away froman enemy or perhaps trying to escapefrom some rocky shore on which they areafraid of being wreckedthen to be sure the sailors must be ind a great imrry said lucy to get downthe broken mast directlybut they could not do it directly inthe old way said harry it required agreat many men pulling and hauling anda great deal of time an hour at leasteven if there were plenty of men andsometimes there are few men and thenit takes a longer time two hours verylikely now by this new invention theysay it can be done by one man or twomen at the most and in five minutes orlessand how is this done said lucy will you tell me the old way first andthen the new way if you can make meunderstand themi do not understand them myself yetsaid harr but i shall soon know moreabout the matter i hope my father is togo next week to see a friend of his wholives near plymouth and there is a greatdockyard at plymouth and a number ofships there and amongst them there isone that has this new inventionbut are you to see it my dear harrysaid lucy yes my father says he will take mewith him said harry is not thatgood very good and next week too andyou will tell me all about it harry whenyou come back and i hope you will see aman of war and that you will describethat to me too said lucynext week arrived and harry's fathertook him to plymouth and to the dockyardon his return he told lucy thathe had seen and heard so much that hedid not know where to begin his descriptionor what to tell her firstfirst tell me about the man of warsaid lucy if you saw one i saw many said harry and i wenton board one and all over it but it isimpossible to give you any idea of itharry however attempted to give heran idea of its magnificent size the heightof the masts the spread of the sails theintricate rigging the coils of ropes on thedeck and the vast thickness of the cableswhich were to draw up the huge ponderousanchor then he described theaccommodations and all the conveniencesfor jiving in this floating wooden townit was more like a town than a house hesaid as it was of such an extent andcontained so many inhabitants severalhundred men and all their provisions andall they must want for living months perhapsyears at sea he described how thesailors hammocks were slung and howthey were aired every day on the deckthen he described the captain's cabin alarge handsome room with a sofa andwriting table and a bookcase and ail thecomforts and luxuries of life but principallyharris expatiated on the manner inwhich the arms were arranged in the gunroomin star shapes and curious formswhich at first he thought was merely forornament but he learned that they wereall so placed in order that they might takeeiup the least possible room and that theymight be found easily in time of needand in the storerooms he observed thatevery thing great and small down to theleast bolt screw or nail had its ownplace the use of order was seen theretothe greatest perfection in time of action as they call it saidharry meaning in time of battle andin a storm when the safety of the vesseland the lives of the men all depend ontheir being able to find what they want inamoment consider my dear lucy whatadvantage it must be to have them all inorder but i cannot give you a rightidea of it you must see it lucy and ihope you will some timeand i hope then you will be withme said lucyi hope so said harry so now iwill tell you about the jiciywhat is di jicir said lucya thick iron bolt said harry whichis run through a hole in the heel or lowerend of the topmast when the topmast isup in its place the ends of the fid restupon two strong bars of wood which arefixed to the head or upper end of thegreat lower mast the topmast standsup between these bars and the fid youperceive lucy supports its whole weightas well as that of all the sails and yardswhich are hung on it and besides allthis weight there are several thick ropesfrom the head of the topmast which arecalled shrouds and which are fasteneddown very tight in order to steady itnow you must understand next continuedharry that when the topmast isup it cannot be taken down without firsttaking out this fidbut what a very odd namewis saidlucyfiddlefaddle said harry nevermind that one name is as good as anotherwhen you are used to it now letme explain the thing itself before the fidcan be pulled out the whole weight of thetopmast must be lifted up off it andbefore this can be done all the ropeswhich steady it on each side must beloosened to lift this great weight theremust be great pulling and hauling andaltogether it is a long difficult job andmany men must work hard at it and foralong time but now without looseningrope and with only one or two menthey get out the new lever fid in a fewminutes how very nice cried lucy nice repeated harry what a wordwhen talking of the masts of a great ship one word is as good as another whenyou are used to it as you said about fidreplied lucy laughing but what is thecontrivance you have not told me that can i understand it yes if you understand the generalprinciple of the use of the lever are youclear of that i believe i am said lucy i knowwhat you have told me and shown methat the greater the space your hand passesthrough in moving the long end of a leverthe more weight you can move at the shortend of itvery well you might have put it inother words but i believe you understandsomething about it said harry nowfor the view lever bids instead of onegreat bolt run through the mast there aretwo strong levers one at each side of itand they are fixed on the same bars whichsupported the ends of the common old fidwhen the topmast is up in its place theshort arm of each lever goes a little wayinto the hole in its heel and the long armissecurely fastened by a small pin to aframe of wood when it is to be loweredthe little fastening pins are taken out thelevers immediately tilt up and down comesthe topmast but not with the sudden anddangerous jerk you might suppose becausethere are ropes from the long arms of thelevers by which the sailors manage theaffair as gently as they likeso then said lucy you mean thatthese two little pins from being appliedat the ends of the long arms of the levershave power to balance the whole weight ofthe great topmast and all its ropes andsails and other things that are supportedon the short arms how wonderful there is the wonderful power of thelever lucy said harry then you could lift any weight in theworld with a lever if you had but one longenough and strong enough said lucyif i had space and time enough andsomething to stand upon said harry iam glad lucy you are so much struck bythe use of this wonderful powder for asmy father said to me when we were talkingabout the fid on our return home itdoes not much signify whether we knowthe best way of lowering the topmast ofa ship but the principle of the lever itis of great consequence that we shouldunderstand because in some way or otherlittle or great we have to use it every dayin the most common things yes said lucy for instance at thismoment when i am going to stir the firei could not without the help of this leverin my hand commonly called the pokerraise up this great heavy coal which nowi lift so easily look putting the pointof my pokerlever under it and restingmy lever on the bar yes the bar is your fulcrum saidharryand by pulling down the other end ofthe poker i gain all the power as you callit of this long lever tell me exactly what advantage youthink you gain said harry tell mehow you would measure iti gain the advantage of the wholelength of the poker said lucy not the whole length of the pokersaid harry look where it rests on thebar from that bar to the point under thecoal is what we may call the short arm ofyour lever and from the place where itrests on the bar to your hand is the longarm of your lever now if you were tomeasure those two lengths and find howmany times longer the one is than theother you would tell exactly the advantageyou gain in this case and in everypossible case in which a lever is usedha the proportion between the longand the short end of the lever said lucy is the advantage gained now i knowexactly oh i hope i shall rememberthisbut lucy is not this leverfid a verysimple invention beautifully simple said lucy ionly wonder that it was never found outbeforethat is the wonder always when anygood contrivance is made said harrybut now i will tell you another wonder that this was not found out by any sailoror captain or admiral or any seaman ofany kind but by a landsman as the captainsaid to papa and what is more hebelongs to a profession quite away fromthe sea he is a lawyer a lawyer lucy exclaimedand what do you think made him alawyer said harryi suppose studying the law said lucyand as they say being called to the barbut said harry i meant to askwhat do you think first turned his mind tothe law or determined him to become alawyer my dear it is a foolish questionof mine because you cannot guess so i will tell you it was his love of mechanics how could that be said lucy i will tell you said harry i heardthe whole story for a gentleman a friendof his who had known him from a boyand as well as he knows himself wastelling it on shipboard to my father thisis what i wanted to come to all the time iwas telling you about the lid the inventorwho has made such a useful inventionwhich will probably save many shipsand the lives of all that are in them hasoften said to his friends that he owes allhis success in life to his early love ofmechanics when he came home fromschool he used to employ himself in doingall the little mechanical jobs that werewanting about the house he used to mendthe locks for instance then in taking alock to pieces he saw how it was madeand by degrees learning the use of tools he made many things which he could notafford to buy when he was a boywhat sorts of things did he makesaid lucyi do not know all i only heard of adesk and a little cabinet i think thenhe took to pieces an old watch of hisfather's and learned how to put it togetheragain when he left school helived two years at home with his fatherand sometimes he employed himself indrawing maps in attempting to drawportions of very large circles on hismaps he found great difficulty for wantof right instruments and he invented andmade for himself an instrument by thehelp of which he could as his friend describedit to my father draw these smallportions of circles without the necessityof using compasses or finding a centrei wish you had invented that harrysaid lucyi exclaimed harry but do youknow he was only eighteen at that time well he was one day using his instrumentand not at all aware that it was anythingbut a help to himself when a gentlemancame into his father's study where hewas drawing this gentleman was charmedwith the invention and advised him to offerit for sale to some optician or some makerof mathematical instruments he determinedto follow this advice and set aboutdirectly and made one neatly in brassand carried it to london to an opticianwho approved of it and gave him for itan air pump and an electrical apparatusand some other instruments delightful cried lucy and whatdid he do next he improved his own little instrumentby adding a scale to it then other peopleused it and found it answered and at lastwhat do you think he had a silver medalvoted and presented to him by the societyof arts when he was yet a boy as hisfriend said not out of his teens a silver medal from the society ofarts i know the look of it said lucyi saw one that was given to a friend ofpapa's i remember seeing it in its littlecrimson case lined with satin but whatan honour for a boy he did not stop there said harryhe went on i know to the fid cried lucy stay a bit said harry we are notcome to the fid yet during those twoyears he lived in a lonely place in southwales and his attention happened to beturned to the shoeing of horses somehorse of his father's was ill shod i supposeand he considered how to preventhorses feet from being cramped and hurtby their shoes he invented an elastichorse shoe better and better said lucystay a bit said harry it wastried upon the horses of some regiment ofhorse guards and it did not do what a pity that must have vexedhim very much said lucynot at all said harry i shouldthink not a man cannot expect alwaysto succeed in every thing much less a boybut though the horseshoe did not succeedyet it led to the most important eventof his lifehow tell me that said lucy iam always glad in lives when we come tothose wordstell me first said harry do youknow what is meant by taking out a patent not very well said lucynot very well but do you know atall do you know what a patent is not exactly said lucy but i haveread about patents and monopolies in theenglish history long ago to mamma in thereign of king james or king never mind about the kings or theirreigns said harry ego on to the thingif you know it i know that the kings of englandwere blamed said lucy for grantingthese monopolies and patentsbut what were they said harryi believe they were permissionsgranted to particular people to sell particularthings and orders that none shouldsell those things but themselves saidlucyi did not think you knew so muchabout it said harry how came you toknow that the way i know most things that ido know said lucy mamma explainedit to me when i was reading to her but those were some of them unjustpatents and mamma explained how andwhy i dare say said harry as my fatherdid to me yesterday b ut there are patentsin these days which i think are veryjust laws which by granting some writingcalled a patent secures to whoever makesany new useful mention the right to sellvol iii eit to others and to have all the credit andprofit of it for a certain number of yearsas a reward for their ingenuity very fair said lucy this gentleman wanted to have apatent for his horseshoe continued harryand before he could obtain it it is necessarythey say to make out in a sort oflaw paper a description of the inventionin lawyer's words he went to a greatlawyer to do this for him but the greatlawyer was no mechanic and he did notunderstand and could not describe thething at all he did the law wordsrightly but the mechanic himself wasobliged to rite the description so borrowingthe law terms from his lawyer heput the description in himself and he didit well and it was thought by others to bewell done now he found that somelawyers are paid a great deal of moneyfor drawing out these patent descriptions specifications is the word which harry did notknowor whatever they call them this firstput it into his head that if he knew asmuch of law as was necessary for this hecould do the whole himself and earn hisbread by doing it for other people thisdetermined him to learn law and hedid so you see as i told you his loveof mechanics first made a lawyer ofhim he acquired all the knowledge requisite and now as his friend said heis unrivalled in england in that particularemployment but now i must tellyou another curious circumstance continuedharry to show you how after hewas a lawyer he was brought back tomechanics again it happened that hewas employed as an advocate in somecause where there was a dispute aboutthe loss of a cargo or the goods onboarda merchant ship which had beenwrecked he was to examine the captainof the ship in the court of justice to findout whether he had or had not done allthat was possible to save the ship and thecargo in this examination he asked theecaptain some question about the loweringthetopmasts the captain laughed athim for his question whatever it was becauseit showed that he did not understandrightly how the topmasts were to be gotdown the captain explained this tohim and showed him the difficulties andi suppose told him all about the fid thecommon old fid i mean he perceivedwhat an inconvenient contrivance it wasand that very evening after the trial byconsidering how a fid could be better managedhe invented the leverfid hisfriend said that when he went to hissupper he cut out the shape of his leverfidin a bit of cheese and thinking thatit would answer its purpose he could notgo to rest till he had made a nice littlemodel in box wood he made model aftermodel till he was satisfied then how toget it into use was the next difficultythe gentleman said a great deal aboutthe lords of the admiralty that i didnot understand but in short his contrivancewas approved by them and theyordered that all the assistance he wantedshould be given to him for trying it insome one ship the maidstone frigatei remember that was the name of the shipin which it was tried and it succeededperfectly the first time the ship wentout to sea with it the topmast was to betakendown and this was done so easilyand quickly that all felt the use and excellenceof the invention and the officersof the navy have given it their decidedapprobation and it has been brought intouse in a great many shipshow happy the man who made thisinvention must be added harry and his sisters and his father andmother said lucy how glad they mustbe to see it succeed so well and to knowhow useful it isan invention useful to all the britishnavy what a grand thing said harryafter pausing and considering for sometimeharry addedyet he was once a boy like me andtrying little mechanical experiments mydear lucy i heard his friend telling myfather something which made a greatimpression upon me the more so becausehe was not thinking of me or that itcould do me any good to hear it when hesaid it what did he say asked lucy eagerlythat this gentleman attributes all hissuccess in life to his having early acquireda taste for mechanics and to the habit oftrying to invent and to improve his earlyinventions in those two years which heemployed so well at home when he camefrom school and before he was fit for anyprofession a time which they say manyboys waste in idlenessi am sure you never will harry saidlucyno after hearing this i think itwould be impossible i should said harry this has raised my ambition i assureyou but i must go on as he did learningby degrees and be content with doinglittle things first what will you do next said lucy now you have finished your boat andyour lock i have a plan said hairy youshall know it tomorrowharry's new project was to build a bridgeover a little mountain stream which hadoften stopped his mother in her walkshe had already laid a board across frombank to bank and had fixed it steadilybut upon this two people could not walkabreast nor could the ass cart pass thisway it was necessary to take it by anotherroad a quarter of a mile round that abridge at this place would be a public andprivate benefit seemed evident and harrywas ambitious of building a real substantialarched bridge which should last hewould not say for ever but as long as mancould reasonably expect a bridge to lastthis project was heartily approved by hisprime counsellor lucy before whose quickanticipating eyes the arch instantly rosecompleteand when it is built cried she itshall be called harrys bridge i or afianother's bridge which shall we call itharrylet us build it first said harry andwe may easily find a name for it afterwardscome with me to the place lucywhen they reached the spot hairy bidher guess what the distance was from bankto bank she guessed about a yard and ahalfa yard and a half such a woman'smeasure that is four feet six saidharrysuch a man's measure six what lucymight have said had she been disposed toretort criticism but that was far ar fromher disposition she knew what he meantand that was all she thought offour feet six inches said she isit more or less you are within half a foot of it mydear said harry my arch must be afive feet span i mean that the widthacross from abutment to abutment fromfoundation stone to foundation stone on theopposite sides must be five feet butthere is my father cried harry on thesands below at the very place where iwant him to be i will show him myplan directlydown the hill ran he to the sea shoreand down ran lucy after him with equalspeed their father was stopped shortand the bridge project started and his consentassistance and advice anxiously requestedlucy thought his first look wasnot favourable he shook his head andanswered that he feared harry would findit beyond his skill or present knowledgeto construct an archharry stood quite still and silent for aminute or two then collecting himself hedeliberately answered i remember father your showing melong ago an arch which you made for meof a thin lath between heavy weiojitsehalf hundred weights from the qreat scaleswhich were placed at each end for buttmeetsthen i pressed on the top of thearch and felt how strong it was it bore alltny weight i recollect this i thinkcontinued he in a very modest but firmtone made me understand the oreatprinciple of the arch which as you told meatthe time depends on the buttments beingsecure and i will take care andmake the abutments of my bridge strongenouohyou will do well hany and you rememberwell and understand one oreatprinciple on which the security of an archdepends but there is much more to beknown and considered however mydear boy try and build your bridge youwill lean best from your own experienceyou may amuse and instruct yourself atthe same time tell me what assistanceyou want and i will tell you whether ican give it to youthank you father then in the firstplace will you come on a few steps that imay stow you my arch which i havedrawn on the sand and will you give meyour opinion of itlucy ran on before to see it first andthen waited anxiously to hear her father'sopinion she saw surprise in his countenancethe moment he looked at the archdescribed on the sandthis is well done harry this willdo said he who showed you how todescribe this arch or how happened itthat you chose this shape more than anyother nobody showed me how said harry but i took it from the little bridge whichi saw the mason building in that lanewhere we went to look at the road mendingi measured the centering as it layon the ground when they had done withit and i drew my arch exactly by thatcentering what is the centering harry whisperedlucy a sort of wooden frame on which thestones of the arch are supported while itis building said harry for you knowthey could not hang in the airhis father told harry he thought he haddone wisely to take advantage of the experienceof a mason who was used tobuild bridges instead of going to workrashly without knowing what he wasabout but father said harry colouring ido not think i deserve to be praised forprudence i was not prudent at all atleast not in the way you think i wouldmuch rather have done it all myself anddrawn my arch my own way and differentfrom this but i took this curve becausethe masons centering will fit it and ithought you could borrow it for me andthat though you might perhaps allow meto build the bridge you would not like thetrouble or expense of getting boards formeto make a centering for myself besidesi was not sure that i could make itall myselfwell harry since i cannot admireyour prudence i am the more satisfiedswithyoiir honesty now what assistancedo you want for your bridge considerand let me know tomorrow i have considered already fathercried harry and if you please i can tellyou all today and this minute stonesin the first place and i know where theycan be had and where they are of no use in the ruins of the old garden wall whichis now rebuilding of brickgranted as many of them as youwant and can carry said his fatherbut there are some too heavy for mesaid harry will you order the boy andthe ass cart to bring themhis father assentedand will you order for me lime andsand enough for mortar if you can tell me how much of eachyou want harryhe could for he had inquired from themason how much had been used in buildingthe bridge of the same size and henamed the quantities then he had fartherto ask for a bucket a hod a troweland a plumbline and the mason's centeringand the mason or the mason's manifhe could be had for three days to assisthim in lifting and placing the heavystoneslucy held her breath with anxietywhile harry uttered all these requestsfearful that so many at once could not begranted but her father was pleased byharry's making them all at once and byhis having so well considered what wasnecessary for his undertaking buckethod trowel plumbline and centering allwere granted but there was a doubt withrespect to the mason or the mason's man i am willing to give you all necessaryassistance of hands but not of head harryi cannot let you have the mason but iwill lend you for three days the mason'sman who if i mistake not has hands butno headi am glad of it father cried harry i mean so much the better for me becauseif he had ever so good a head itwould be in my way it would hinder mefrom using my own then i should notlearn as you said from my own experiencei would rather do all that i possiblycan of my bridge for myself i am sorrythe arch is not my own but that could notbe helped you know father on account ofthe centering however just the curve of the archdoes not much signify i suppose saidlucy one shape one curve of an archis much the same or as good as anotherthough not so pretty perhapsthere you are quite mistaken lucysaid her father one curve on the contrarymay be as pretty but not as good asanother not as capable of sustaining weightnot as durable there is a great deal ofdifference between one curve and anotherfor a bridge as harry when he has moreknowledge of science will be able to explainto youharry again expressed his regret thathe had this arch laid out ready to his handin short said he now the mostdifficult the most scientific part is doneand i have only to do the easy masonworkpart which any body can do withoutmaking any mistakes or requiring any ingenuity there is no danger harry of your notfinding sufficient difficulty before you havedone there is room enough left i promiseyou to make mistakes and to exerciseas much ingenuity as you possessharry brightened up again on hearingthis and so did lucy the more difficulty the more glorysaid sheas soon as all was provided which wasnot quite so speedily as lucy wishedharry set to work first he cleared andlevelled a place on the bank on each sidefor his foundations then while theheavy stones were drawing up by the asshe was busy very busy making mortarwith the assistance of the man without ahead the great foundation stones werethen placed harry taking particular careto choose the most solid weighty stonesand to have them laid level and firmthen came the wooden frame work thatwas to support the mason work while theywere building the arch the centeringas lucy knew that it was called and shewould have liked to have examined itbut she would not interrupt harry at thismoment for he was eager to have it putup and to get on with the work thereforeshe stood by without interrupting theoperations by question or remark thecentering was hoisted up and fixed byharry and the headless man whosehands and length of arms were it must beacknowledged of manifest use upon thisoccasion the wooden arch was raisedto the height at which the stone arch wasto be built upon it and it was supported ateach side by upright props between theseand the wooden frame wedges were putin and harry busy as he was stopped toexplain to lucy that these wedges were tobe knocked out when the bridge was completedand that the wooden arch beingremoved would as it was to be hopedleave the stone one standing firmthen the building of the arch beganwe cannot follow the work stone by stoneas lucy did with untired sisterly sympathynot only stone by stone as each wasplaced but as they were many a time displacedand tried over and over again beforethey fitted to lucy's surprise andmortification she observed that even thestupid mason's man by long practice couldjudge better which stones would best fitand how they would best go into certainplaces than harry could with all hisquickness of eye and sense this wasmost apparent the first and second days onthe third after even this little practiceharry found his eye and hand improvingand his sense began to get the better of hisawkwardness at his new trade afterthis third day's long and hard and hotlabour the arch rose from each side till itnearly met at top and wanted only theputting in of the last stone the key stoneto complete the work harry showedlucy that when this was put in all theparts of the arch were pressed togetherand that none could give way without displacingthe others each part tended tosupport each and to hinder any stone frombeing pressed upwards or downwardsmore than another so it is impossible it should comedownas long as it is an arch said lucy as long as it is an arch impossiblesaid harry all we have to desire isthat it should never alter from this shapeand i do not see how it can continuedhe looking at it my abutments are sosecure there is no danger of their givingway or being thrust out by any weightthat will go over the bridgenow then said lucy you willtake away all this wooden underbridgeand these props and you are to knock outthe wedges that you may take down thecentering now the bridge is finishednot yet said harry we must leaveit some time for the stones to settle andthe mortar to dry a littlelucy's impatience yielded to her brother'sprudence but he was very eagerhimself for the taking down of the centeringthat trying time at length arrivedan anxious moment even to old experiencedarchitects veteran bridge builders thewedges were knocked away the propsfell the centering was lowered andwithdrawn from under the arch and itstood i harry took breath and pushedback his hat off his hot forehead lucyclapped her hands exclaimingit stands harry's bridge stands itshall be called harry's bridge no my mother's bridge said harryif you please it was for her i built it and i will run and call her to see itcried lucy and i will go for my father saidharry i hope he is not busyneither father nor mother were to befound in the house they were outridingand they staid out till it was so late thatharry and lucy thought it was better notto ask them to look at the bridge till thenext day their mother had never yetseen even the plan she was not in thesecret they hoped that she would bedelightfully surprised it was settled thatshe should be invited out to look at itearly the next day she was as theyarranged it to be handed over the bridgeby harry to a seat which lucy had preparedin a recess in the rocks on the oppositeside where she might sit and readhappilyalas who can answer for tomorrowthe next day it rained and the next andthe next poured torrents the rain lastedwithout intermission a week a long melancholyweek for in rupert's cottagethey had not the same means of amusingand employing themselves which theypossessed at home they had but fewbooks and those few belonged chiefly totheir latin or english lessons theirfather and mother had been promised theuse of the library of a friend who lived inthe neighbourhood and upon the faith ofthis promise they had brought scarcelyany books with them but their friendunexpectedly called to town upon businesswas unfortunately for them absentthere was no circulating library no booksociety in this part of the countrythere was one advantage to be sure inpossessing but few books these were wellread and many things found in themwhich had escaped attention when in themidst of greater variety at last theywere reduced to johnson's dictionary notthe delightful quarto in which there arequotations from all the best authors in ourlanguage exemplifying the various uses ofeach word with the great johnson theymight have happily amused themselves atnight reading those quotations and puzzlingtheir father and mother by makingthem guess the authors this had oftenbeen a favourite resource at home butnow they had the little octavo johnson inwhich there are only the meanings andthe derivations of the words of thishowever they made what profit and diversionthey could they picked outwords for each other to explain and comparedtheir own explanation with definitionsin the dictionary now lucy i will give you a woman'sword to darn cried harry let us seewhether you can explain the meaning aswell as it is explained here by a man lucy made many attempts her colourrising at each ineffectual trial and at lastshe could not equal the mans definition ofto darnto mend holes by imitating the textureof the stufflucy had her revenge when they cameto network which is thus described by thelearned doctor any thing reticulated or decoratedat equal distances with interstices betweenthe intersections look for decussate said harrylucy turned over the leaves and read decussate to intersect at acute angleswell that is something like nettingsaid harryis it how said lucy why you know said harry in anet each mesh or stitch is intersected is itnot at acute angles but it is not intersected said lucy for to intersect means to cut in twodoes not it and the mesh of the net insteadof being cut in two is joined at thecorners is it not very extraordinary thatthe man should say the very contrary towhat he means and to the sense of thething it would be very extraordinary if itwere so said cautious harry but ithink to intersect does not always mean tocut in two i know in euclid lines aresaid to be intersected when they are onlycrossed on turning to the dictionary harryfound himself supported in his assertionfor there are two verbs to intersect oneis a verb active meaning to cut to divideeach other the second is a verbneuter and means what i told you saidharry to meet and cross each other as in your net the threads do meet andcross at the angles yes said lucy but they must domore not only cross but be tied andknotted i wish continued she thatdictionary makers would use easy wordsinstead of words more difficult than thosethey are explaining at least when i am assleepy as i am now i can look for nomore words so good night dr johnsoni am going to bedlet me put him away for you saidharry poor creature you are fastasleepas he went to put johnson in his placehe saw another dictionary by dr ash onthe same shelf and taking it down said hehad a mind before he gave up the searchjust to look in this for networkit will do you no good said lucy all the dictionary people since johnson'stime have copied from him mamma toldme so and she told me a droll storywhich proves what bungling copies theyvol iii fsometimes make but i am too sleepy torecollect it rightly mamma would yoube so good as to tell him about curmudgeonrhis mother asked him if he knew whatis meant by a curmudgeonyes a cross selfish miserly personis not it and can you guess from what theword is derived harry it is but fair totell you that it is a corruption of twofrench words ill pronounced french words said harry then ihave no chance if you had said englishwords i might have said two that mustcame into my headoh say them for i am sure they areodd by your look said lucy wakeningwith the hope of diversion cur munching said harry say itquickly and it will make curmudgeonand a cur munching is cross and miserlyif you attempt to take his bone from himlucy laughed and tried to repeatcur munching as often and as quickly asshe could to turn it into curmudgeon forharry and his mother wrote down forhim the derivation as it is given in thequarto edition of johnson's dictionarycurmudgeon n s it is a vitiousmanner of pronouncing coeur merchants fran unknown correspondentnow here is ash's dictionary criedlucy i will look for it i am quiteawake now mamma but stay firstharry tell us what you think is meant by fr an unknown correspondent fr means french to be sure saidharry and an unknown correspondentsent johnson this derivation i supposeyou suppose perfectly rightly saidlucy but now look how dr ash understoodor misunderstood it for want ofknowing the meaning of the two frenchwords here it iscurmudgeon noun sub from the frenchcoeur unknown merchant correspondentexcellent cried harry laughinglet me see it oh mamma can you tell us any moref of such droll mistakes said lucy idare say there are a great many more ifone could but find them and i should liketo make a list of them allto shame the poor dictionarymakerssaid harry but that would be veryungrateful of you after all lucy forconsider how often dictionaries havehelped us when we were in difficultiesand how much amusement we have hadfrom johnson's quotationsin the great johnson oh i acknowledgedthat at first said lucy andyou forget this curmudgeon mistake wasnot your dear great or little johnson's soi am not ungrateful but you know you triumphed overhim when you had him caught in yournetwork said harrybecause of his hard words saidlucylucy said her father did you everhear the fable of apollo and the criticno papa pray tell it to me saidlucy i love fablesare you awake enough to hear andunderstand it said her fatheryes papa perfectly wide awake curmudgeon and the munching cur havewakened me completelythere was a famous critic who reada famous poem for the express purpose offinding out all its faults and when he hadfound them and made a list of them hecarried his list and his notes to apolloapollo ordered that a bushel of the finestwheat that had ever grown on mount parnassusshould be brought and he orderedthat it should be winnowed with the utmostcare and when all the corn was separatedfrom the chaff apollo presented the chaisto the critic for his reward and banishedhim for ever from parnassus thank you papa said lucy iunderstand the moral of that fable verywell and i think i hall better banish myselfto bed now good night harry ihope it will be a fine day tomorrowit was a fine day all the dark cloudshad disappeared and left the sky clear'blue the sandy soil had dried so quicklythat harry and lucy flattered themselvesthat their mother would walk out this morningand they ran to prepare her seat beyondthe bridgebut oh disappointment extreme oh melancholy sight the bridge was nomore nothing remained of the arch butsome fragments over which the waterswere rushing the mountain streamwhich had been swelled by the rains to atorrent had not yet sunk to its naturalquiet state but was dashing down therock with deafening noiseharry stood motionless looking at iti do not hear you my dear said heas lucy twitched his arm to obtain ananswer what do you say come a little further away from thisnoise said lucy i say that i am exceedinglysorry for you harrythank you said harry so am isorry for myself but sorrow will do nogoodhow could it happen when you tooksuch care about the abutments askedlucyi did not take care enough saidharry that much is clear but it is notclear to me how it all happened or why the water covers every thing now itruns you see over the banks beyond myfoundations we must have patienceoh how hard it is to have patiencesometimes said lucy with a deep sighharry could not forbear echoing hersigh though he passed it off with a hemimmediately thinking it was not manlyhe was determined to bear his disappointmentlike a man but he could not helpfeeling itin the evening when the waters hadsubsided they revisited the place of theirmisfortune while harry surveyed theruins below and examined into the causeof the disaster lucy stood on the banklooking alternately at his countenanceand at the fragments of the fallen bridgein all the respectful silence of sympathyi see now how it happened saidharry though i made my abutmentsstrong enough i did not go down to thesolid rock for my foundations i bush themon the bank which i thought at the timewas firm enoughso did i i am sure said lucy itwas as firm and hard as the ground i amnow standing uponbut it was all sandy soil as you cansee here where it has been broken awaysaid harry and i perceive exactly howit happened when the rain swelled thatmountain torrent the water came higherunder my arch than i ever expectedwho could have expected it saidlucy there was not room for it to pass underneathcontinued harry and thereforeit pressed against the sides of the archand rose up over the banks then theearth and sand were loosened the foundationswere undermined the stones wereswept away and then down fell our arch poor arch poor harry said lucythat horrible mountain torrent howviolent it was who could have thought itwho had only seen it running gently in itspeaceable way but it is all over wecan never have a bridge here we mustgive it up give it up because i have made onemistake said harr and when i seethecause of it oh no if my father willbut let me try again and here he is andi will ask him cried harryhis father who had heard of his misfortunewas coming to condole with himand to inquire how it had happenedharry showed him you were quiteright father said he in foreseeingthat i should find room enouoi to makemistakes and so i have you see butthis was my first attempt and now i havelearnt something by experience will oube so kind as to let me try again and letme have the assistance of the mason'sman for three days more three days more of a labourer's work attwo shillings a day some people wouldconsider this a oreat deal too much to fivef to the mother s bridge or rather to thesons bridge but harry's kind father didnot think so he was pleased to find thathis son was not discouraged by disappointmentand that he had immediatelyset about to discover the cause of hisfailure and he told harry that he shouldhave the mason's man for three days tomake a second trial upon the same conditionsas before and will you help me father to find abetter place for my foundations will youfather no harry do it all yourselfhe would give no opinion or advice hepursued his walk to the wood and harrywas left to determine his plans aftermuch careful deliberation he decided ona place a little higher up the stream wherethe foundations of his abutments wouldstand upon the solid rock so that no treacheroussand or loose earth should bewashed away by the torrent and again exposethem to be underminedafter settling this point and measuringthe span and other dimensions he repairedto the seashore to draw the planand elevation of his second bridge thestream being rather wider and thebanks much higher in the new situationthat he had chosen it was clear that thearch could not be the same as the first and at this he seemed to rejoice and sodid lucy for now it would be all hisown he described arches of variouscurves on the sands but he had no exactprinciple or rule to guide him in what hewas about he had a general notion thatthe strength of his bridge must depend insome degree on the curve or the proportionbetween its span and height and thatthe weight and pressure it was to bear onits different parts should be calculatedbut how to accomplish all this or how tochoose the best curve for the situation hedid not know he could be guided onlyby his eye by a sort of feeling of proportion by guess in short lucy assistedlii with her feelings and taste as to whichwas the prettiest my dear harry cried she thathigh pointed arch is very ugly it willnever do your first bridge was a muchprettier curveit must be this height my dear saidharry because my foundations are to beupon the rock which is far below thebank the top of my bridge will bebut a little above the level of the path oneach side and when the bridge is builti shall fill np the space between the sideand the banks with stones and earth andthen level the road over it from the pathon each side he drew the slope for herand she was satisfiedbut now harry had to consider the seriousaffair of a centering for his new archhis father had said that if he could makeone for himself he might do so andthat he would supply him with boards ifhe could tell him exactly what he wantedharry fortunately knew what he wanted but he was ashamed when he came towrite down all that would be necessaryto see how much it wastwelve thin boards each four feetlong and nine inches wide and threeboards six feet long which are each tobe slit into two parts for ties and sixuprights of any pieces of rough wood and nails one hundred and a halfhis father seemed satisfied with thesedistinct orders and told him that he shouldhave all that he required next morningthe carpenter and his boy arrived bearingthe wishedfor boards on their shouldersthe moment harry obtained possession ofthem to work he went to make his centeringflat on the ground he laid four ofhis four feet boards two forming each sideof the pointed arch and bringing theirupper edges as nearly as he could bringstraight lines to something like the curveswhich he had marked upon the groundthe ends of the boards were lapped overwhere they joined and the corners wereleft projecting on the outside it is not in the least like an arch yetsaid lucy have patience and you shall see saidharrywith all the decision of a carpenter whoknows what he is about harry bored holesfor his nails and nailed the pieces togetheras they lay three nails in each sidejoint and four at the top then he nailedone slip of one of the six feet long boardsacross his wooden arch at bottom to holdit together and another piece half way uptobrace and strengthen it then hesawed ois the jutting corners of the boardswhich had been left sticking out andchiselled and planed away parts of theouter edges to bring them to the curveshe wanted three such frames or woodenarches he made in the same manner andexactly of the same sizethen having determined on the properbreadth for his intended bridge and havingmarked it on the ground by two parallellines and drawn another midway betweenthem he placed the frames erect on theirlower edge and exactly upon the threeilllines with ready lucy's assistance andsome broken branches he secured themsteady and upright and then proceededto roof them over with narrow slips ofwood bits of paling which he had preparedfor this purpose these he nailedacross the top of all the three archesleaving intervals between of the breadthof each slip so that when the whole wasdone lucy said that it looked somethinglike the model of the roof of a housethis day's work completed the centeringprops wedges and all were preparedfor putting it up and going on withthe masonry there was no hindrancefrom the stream the little rivulet nowsunk to insignificance ran so quietly downits pebbly bed that lucy could scarcelybelieve it to be the same which had roaredso loud and foamed so high and had donesuch mischief in its furythe masonwork of harry's secondbridge went on more rapidly than that of hisfirst his eye and hand having become moreexpert in the builder's art he workedand wondered at the work he made orrather lucy wondered at it for himhow one improves by practice criedshe as she stood by looking on while thearch was closing the key stone was inbefore they left off work on the fourth dayand the triumphant finishing blow of themallet givenbut the work of the arch only wasfinished much remained to be done toclose up the hollow on each side of thebridge between it and the banks thiswas to be filled in with stones and earthdown to the rocky foundation a heavyjob and heavily they felt it the threedays allowed them of help from the headlessman or as lucy now in gratitude forhis services called him the handy manwere passed they averse left to themselvesand obliged to bring the stones andthe earth from a distance of many yardsand up a height the handy man hadcarried his barrow ofi and they hadonly one wheelbarrow and a basket ifbasket it could be called which was soinfirm that it let through continualscribbling of sand lucy howevermended this with a plaiting of sea weedand stuffings of moss and refrained asharry was busy from saying somethingshe could have said about the sieve of thedana'ideswhen at last both gulfs were filled upand well trampled and harry was spreadinggravel on the road over the bridgelucy had time to rest for they had butone shovel and while he shovelled awayshe sat on a large mossy stone amusingherself with observing a community ofants whose dwellings had been disturbedby the new works these emigrants weretoiling on in search of new habitationseach with his white load in his forceps allfollowing the leader through the mossand up the stone to them a rock of perilousheight and scarcely practicableascent once when a wayworn ant hadjust reached the summit a white polishedtreacherous pebble intervened he raisedone half of his body so as to be almostperpendicular and wabbling about hislittle head from side to side deliberatedwhich way he could go or whether hecould go at all on he went straight upthe slippery hill on the pinnacle of thewhite pebble another pinnacle arose ofsparkling mica whose projecting pointsproved fatal striving to reach the firstof these he lost his balance he fell headover heels if ants have heels and at thebottom of the hill lay on his back on thesand for a moment helpless but thenext instant being an ant of spirit nerighted himself resumed his load and hislabour up the hill labour in vain thistime a treacherous rush more treacherousthan the pebble a springy green rush orbranch of sedge hanging from abovetempted him to trust himself on its smoothgreen side butthe wind fell a blowing and set it a goingand gave our dear joy a most terrible tosslucy held out a helping finger andraising him up placed him safely at onceupon the very pinnacle he had been solong labouring to attain away he ranas she hoped perfectly happy she wasparticularly pleased with him for this because she had sometimes helped up antswho had not seemed in the least obligedto her for her assistance nor at all happierfor it but on the contrary by turningback directly or not going the way shewished had provokingly given her to understandthat they would rather have beenwithout her interference in spite howeverof these incivilities and of the little disguststhey had at the moment excited her love forthe species had continued it had inddcommenced happily in early childhood atthe time when she and harry used towatch them making their causeway andby reading the travelled ant inevenings at home it increased whenshe read with her mother that entertainingpaper in the guardian well known toyoung and old and it had been of late renewedwith fresh interest by some curiousanecdotes which her mother had told herfrom ruler's history of the industriousraceharry said she taking up her basketagain i feel quite rested i havebeen very happy looking at these ants iam sure this has rested me better than if ihad been the whole time yawning andthinking of nothing at allpray can any body think of nothingat all said harry let every body answer for themselvessaid lucy i think that i havesometimes thought of nothing at all but iam not sure yes indeed i remembersaying to myself now i am thinking ofnothing but then my dear lucy said harryyour own very words prove you were notthinking of nothing how so said lucy you were thinking that you werethinking of nothing at all said harry i do not understand said lucy isnot that nonsense harry oh no my dear it is metaphysicssaid harryand what do you mean by metaphysicsmy dear said lucyit comes from two greek words saidharrybut i do not ask you where it comesfrom said lucy but what you meanby iti said harry a little puzzled imean i am not sure i believe metaphysicsis the knowledge of our otimindsbut if we do not know our ownminds said lucy of what is it theknowledge will you tell me harry i cannot tell you more said harryi will look for metaphysics in the dictionarywhen we have time but now letus on with our bridgeove however hairyyou may laugh but i assure you as istooped down to look at one of them heput up his head and looked at me andsee there is another coiling his tailhow curious i do not touch them normove any thing that touches them hereare my hands not even near their drawerso that i cannot have loosed any springthatcould set them in motion but perhapsopening the drawer did itno but that is not a bad guess saidsir rupert think again lucy said hany andyou will find it out first let me look at this conjurer saidlucy pointing to a painted figure of aconjurer with a long beard and cap andwand of which she saw glimpses underthe serpents at the bottom of the drawer may i have him out sir said lucyperhaps he may tell me something i havea mind to consult himdo as you please said sir rupert but i think you had better consult yourown senseyes yes so i will said lucy iam only in joke about the conjurer but ijust want to look at him because wheni have satisfied my curiosity about him ishall think better about the serpentsas she spoke she cautiously began toput her hand down through the midst ofthem toward the bottom of the drawer toseize hold of the conjurer but the serpentsall rearing their heads or tails immediatelyshe hastily withdrew her handi am afraid i shall do some miscliietvsaid she no my dear said sir rupert smiling you will do no mischief to them andthey will do none to you there is nodanger danger oh no know that saidlucy but i think harry had better beso good as to take him out for meharry plunged in his hand and drew upthe conjurer by the beard there he isfor you said harry what good willhe do you it is only a coloured print on a papercase now i see it in the light said lucymay i open the case sir there seemsto be something in itas sir rupert assented she opened it within the case she found a yellow paperon which were what lucy called hieroglyphics and inside were a number of littlefish about twice the length of the motherofpearlfish which are used as countersat a cardtable but these were not ofdmotherofpearl they were of some verythin material thin as oiled paper or asgoldbeater's skin and somewhat of thatcolour as lucy looked close to see whatthey were made of they began to movesir rupert took one by the tail out ofthe paper and bidding lucy hold out herhand he laid it flat upon the palm atfirst it lay still but in a few seconds beganto heave and move its head and taillike the serpent said lucy buthow or why they move i cannot conceivebecause there is no room for any springor any mechanism harry withinsidethere is no double skin he is quitetransparent i can see through him andthere is nothing in him how he writhesabout but what says the conjurer whathas he to do with it let me look at hispaper and try if i can make it out it isnot english copenhagen copenhagenit is danish thenyes this conjurer and his fish werebrought to me from copenhagen by anofficer long ago before they became commonin this country and they afforded usthen much amusement trying the temperamentsand fortunes or at least the tempersand understandings of those who consultedthis conjurer and took his fish in handhere is an english translation of his advertisementfor you lucylucy read and learned that the conjurerpromised to tell the temperaments dispositionscharacters and fortunes of all mannerof men women and children by theaid of his fish mute but not still theirmotions spoke a language which as he'boasted could never like the language ofmen err or deceive and this language heto a certain degree and in some generalpoints condescended to interpret for theadvantage of all who consulted him andpurchased his hieroglyphic scroll oppositeto the hieroglyphics on this scrollwere the interpretations of the differentmotions of the fishes heads and tails andbodies also what was to be inferred fromtheir lying still and motionlessnow i understand the directions andlet us try on ourselves said lucy holdout your hand harryshe placed one of the fish flat on hispalm and observing its motions whichwere quick and sudden floundering vithhis tail she consulted her hieroglyphicsand found that harry was sanguine andcholeric fortunate in war that is not true i can answer for itcried lucy as far as the choleric andsanguine go now try mesatrabilious and melancholia to dieof a broken heart if not taken in timelucy let fall the fish while she laughedand exclaimed what nonsense the fish fell into seme water which waskept in the workshop for the use of thegrindstone recovering from her laughtershe said that he was at last in his properelement yet he did not seem to like ithis head and tail curling up met and helay with only the middle of his side touchingthe water as if he feared to go input him quite in said harry andsee what will happenlucy pressed him down into the waterbut not without his struggling howeverwhen he was fairly in for it as she saidhe ceased to flounder and lay perfectlyquiet now let us take him out and dryhim said harry and see what willhappenharry dried one of his sides and laidhim down in the sunshineoh the poor fish cried lucy heis just as the proverb says as uncomfortableas a fish out of water how he writhesabout i'll sprinkle a little water overhim stay let me dry him quite and thatwill do as well you will see said harry he will lie quietly then though he is afish ont of waterwell try said lucy now hedoes lie quiet indeed exactly as if he weredeadbut as she stooped closer to look athim he seemed to revive and movedagainas if he felt my breath cried lucy oh harry i see how it is row iknow it allharry smiled you are right said sir rupertand you knew it all the while harrysaid lucy i was very stupid not tothink of it beforeyou would have thought of it saidharry but that you were so full of theconjuror but even now i do not know allsaid lucy i suppose that the motionsof this fish depend on the changesfrom wet to dry and that he curls andincurs as my hair does and for thesame reason i have not forgottenharry all you and papa explained tomeabout the cause of curling whenone side is wet and the other drywhen the pores are filled with moistureon one side and not on the other iunderstand that that was the case withthe fish when you dried him on one sideand left him wet on the other but vol iii ncannot yet guess of what substance he ismade think of some of those substances ofwhich you know hygrometers are madesaid harry old whalebone hygrometer i rememberyou said lucy you smile harryit is whalebone but i never saw anybefore so thinvery likely you never did saidharry but whalebone can be scrapedvery thin as thin as this you seeit really is whalebone then and icould make such a fish myself saidlucy if my head had not been sofull of that foolish conjuror i mighthave seen all that you observed harryand then i should have found it outtooi dare say that now you will find outwhat the chinese serpents are made ofsaid sir rupertthey are hygrometers too then isuppose said lucy hey harry whatcan they be made of do you know i am not sure but i believe i dosaid harryyes you are right said sir rupertfollowing the motion of harry's eyelucy turned and looked yet she sawnothing as she said but dust under theworkbench and a box full of old ironand brass and hundreds of things continuedshe going towards ityou had better stop and think insteadof going into that box said harry lookback at the serpents and see what they arelike recollect all the substances whichyou know would make good hygrometersand then consider which is most like theseserpentsivory cried lucy i remember youtold me that it has many pores and that itmakes a good hygrometer they must bemade of ivory and now i know whatyour eye turned to it was to that curledshaving of ivory which is lying on thefloorsir rupert after some conversation withharry about hygrometers asked him if hehad ever seen daniel's and when harryn answered that lie had not sir rupert exclaimed let whoever is curious in hygrometersfollow me to the laboratoryharry followed instantly but lucy didnot she thought she had had enough of hygrometers and she preferred going to divertherself with a canary bird which she sawhanging in its cage at the window of thehousekeeper's room on the side of thecourt opposite to the laboratory thisbird could as the housekeeper told herdraw up water for itself in a little bucketshe saw this bucket it was about thesize of a thimble it hung by a delicatechain on the outside of a sort of projectingo bow window in the cage the upperend of the chain was fastened to the bird'sfoot and the bucket lay in a small reservoirof water the manner in which thebird drew it up was as the housekeepertold lucy by taking the chain in his beakand by placing his foot on each portion ofit as it was drawn up till the bucket wasas high as the little window where hecould drinkhe disliked it seems the labour ofdrawing water and never performed thisoperation except when compelled by thirstunluckily for lucy just before she arrivedhe had drawn up a bucket full and havingsatisfied his thirst he was now singingaway loud and shrill as if rejoicing inhaving cast dull care behind him lucywaited and waited she and the housekeeperexhausted all their exhortations althe endearing epithets in the language andall their hemp seed in vain the canarytook all the bribes as fast as they wereoffered and received all the complimentsseemingly in good part but no returnmade he not that he did not understandwhat return was expected the rogueeyed the bucket askance as the housekeeperheld it up to him then straight heturned his back upon her or upon it andsang away pertinaciously with a louderand a shriller note than before a fullquarter of an hour was spent upon himthen lucy gave it upwhat an obstinate or capricious littlecreature it is said lucy she then wentto ask lady digby whether it hurt him todraw up the bucketlady digby said she believed it did nothurt him though she could not be certain but she thought his unwillingness to performthe operation might be accounted forbyrecollecting the pain which he hadundergone in learning this feat it is saidthat much cruelty is practised on birdswhen young in teaching them this andother accomplishments how happy lucy it is for some youngbirds who are taught accomplishmentswithout painmeantime as soon as sir rupert andharry had returned to the laboratory sirrupert said before i show you the newhygrometer harry i must tell you thatin all those hygrometers which are madeof vegetable or animal substances andwhich measure the moisture of the air bytheir expansion or contraction there isone great source of error they have nostandard point by which they may bereadily compared with each other thegreat de saussure whom you will admirestill more for his random than for hisingenuity foresaw and pointed out thisfault in his own hair hygrometer and thecelebrated humboldt who used both thehair and the whalebone hygrometers complainedthat he could never make theirresults agree another philosopher callsall the ordinary hygrometers mere toys but without going further it is enoughfor you to know that from this cause allthose instruments are found to be insufficientfor ranking nice observations on theatmosphere they have besides otherimperfections no two hairs are exactlysimilar in elasticity whalebone is not onlyvery irregular but very slow in its expansion the wind disturbs their movementsand dust and oil in time clog thepivots thank you sir said harry forexplaining to me the faults of the oldones now for the new one said sir rupert you have i dare say often observedthe dewy appearance on the outsideof a glass of cold water when broughtinto a warm room this dewy appearanceyou know is the condensation of the moisturecontained in the air and it was thiscircumstance that first turned mr dan i ell'sthoughts to a new mode of measuring thepi'oportiojt they bear to each other withthe aid of some hints which he candidlyacknowledges that he received from otherphilosophers with whose names at least youmust be acquainted dalton and wollastonhe succeeded in making the ingenious instrumentwhich i will now show youhe placed before harry's eyes a brasstand and pillar five or six inches inheight to the pillar was fixed a smallthermometer and from the top there hunga glass tube each end of which was bentdown and terminated in a ball or globe ofthin glass one of these globes wascovered with muslin and the other containeda very delicate thermometer the bulbof which was partly immersed in ether the first thing to tell you harrysaid sir rupert is the purpose of thesetwo thermometers the outside one onthe pillar shows the temperature of theair while the inside one marks the temperatureof the ether and therefore of theglass globe that contains itnow let us place it in this open window and when i wet the muslin coveringof the empty ball with a few drops ofether you are to observe what takes placeon the other ballit was what is called a very dry dayand after sir rupert had applied the ethertwo or three times harry said that he sawa slight film of dew forming like a ringround the uncovered ballnow harry said sir rupert markthe height of both thermometers you are aware he continued thatrapid evaporation produces cold and thatether evaporates more rapidly than any otherfluidharry was partly aware of this yet hewas surprized by the instantaneous coldn produced by a drop of ether that sir rupertlet fall on the back of his hand when i applied some ether to themuslin said sir rupert the glass underit was immediately cooled and thecondensation of the vapour inside graduallycommunicated the cold to the otherball the degree of cold there is shownby the inside thermometer and the differencebetween that and the temperatureof the external air at the moment the dewis deposited on the glass is the measurewe want of the moisture suspended in theatmospherethen i suppose sir said harry the drier the air the greater is the differencebetween the thermometers for thedifference is fifteen degreesyou are right harry and i will endeavourto explain to you how and whywhen water is evaporated from the surfaceof the earth it can only be supportedin the atmosphere by the influence of heata decrease of heat therefore condensessome of the watery vapour and when thereis a large proportion of moisture in theair a very small additional degree of coldprecipitates it in the shape of rain or dewif that had been the case during our experimentor in other words if it had beenjust going to rain you would have seenthe film of dew immediately follow theapplication of the ether to the coveredball on the contrary when the air isvery dry a considerable increase of coldis requisite to make it part with its moistureas you have found to be the case today the inside thermometer having fallenfifteen degrees before the dew was depositedon the ballall we have to do then said harryis to observe what additional degree ofcold is necessary to convert the vapour intowater and this is shown by the differenceof the two thermometers when the ringof dew is formedthat degree of cold said sir rupertis called the point of deposition or thedewpoint and this hygrometer marks itwith great precision for an instrumentof daily use however i think it hasone inconvenience can you perceive whatit is harry harry after a few moments reflectionanswered it is certainly an inconvenienceto be obliged to pour fresh ether onthe ball every time an observation is to bemadethat is what i meant said sir rupert but on the other hand in this veryingenious instrument there is no unequalstretching of hair or whalebone no cloggingof the pivots with dust and the resultsare certain as certain and as easilycompared with each other as the results ofthe thermometerafter this explanation for which harrywas very thankful sir rupert advised himto look at the inventor's own descriptionof the instrument in the quarterly journalof science no but first said sir rupert let us goout if you please this fine day and havesome exercise and some amusement rememberthe bow must not be alwaysbent by the bye here are bows and arrowsand here is a little bow which edwardhad when he was your age whichwill just suit your sister lucy call herand brinof her out with you to the bowlinggreen i will have the target set up forsou an hour and a half is it possiblesaid lucy that we have been really anhour and half here on this bowlinggreen exactly an hour and a half since firsti fixed an arrow in that bow and settledit in your hand said harry for i happenedto look at the sundial just as iwent back to my placewe have been so very happy i saidlucy stretching out her arm to rest itbut now you seem to be rather tiredof your happiness said her father andyou had better stop before pleasure turnsinto pain my arm only is tired papa saidlucy i am not the least tired myselfhowever i think we have had enough fortoday and we can come back to it tomorrowif tomorrow should be as fine astodayin the mean time come with me tothe house said sir rupert thisway leads towards the old part of thecastle i will turn you into a cool armouryto rest yourselves and where perhaps youmay find fresh amusement in looking atthe bows and arrows of former timesthey followed joyfully to the armoury he showed them in the first place a bowand arrows which had remained in thiscastle family tradition failed to tell howlong but certainly since the days of ourhenrys and edwards when bowmen andarchers flourished and when bows andarrows were not as now taken up as mattersof amusement by fine gentlemen andladies to win prizes at festive meetingsbut employed as serious weapons in battlesand sieges sir rupert was going on toshow harry the crossbow such as was inuse and repute among our ancestors butlucy's eye was caught by an indian bowand arrow and he turned to take it downfor her it was stiff with rings of driedthongs of leather which had been put onthe bow to commemorate each savage victoryobtained by the owner next to thisindian bow there hung another said tohave been brought from mexico at the timewhen those poor people or unhappily forthem those too rich people were invadedby the avaricious pizarro and when theirbows and arrows so ill defended themagainst the firearms of the spaniardsharry and lucy regretted the fate of theinoffensive mexicans and wished that theyhad been possessed of the ingenious inventionof firearms for their just defencesir rupert went back to the crossbowand showed harry how it was constructedand used the stock was made of woodneatly inlaid with bone and ornamentedwith tassels but the bow was of steel andso stiff that harry's utmost efforts couldscarcely bend it sir rupert told him thatno person had sufficient strength to drawbackthe string into its place without somemechanical assistance and desired him toexamine the bow carefully harry observeda long iron lever the end of whichturned upon a pin in the middle of thestock to this lever a little jointed armwas attached which terminated in a kindof hook that seemed to invite the string he slipped the string over the hook andpulling round the outer end of the leverdown to the butt end of the stock heeasily accomplished the bending of thebow sir rupert then showed them thetrigger or serpeiit'we as he said it wasformerly called by which the string wasreleased and the arrow or ball projectedharry was surprised to hear him mentionballs still more when he was toldthat balls both of lead and stone were usedsir rupert showed them also various kindsof darts and arrows one of which to lucy'sgreat amusement he called a quarrel heexplained to her however that the termwasderived from the old french wordquarreaii on account of its square headof iron crossbows and quarrels sirrupert added were much used in the timeof henry the second they were of greateffect in his wars in ireland and assistedmuch in his conquest of the irish whopossessed no such weaponsin this armoury were many of the warlikeinstruments and armour used in ancienttimes by the english sir rupert showedharry the helmet the vizor and the lance and explained to him how the lance stood inthe rest when the knight was on horseback and he showed him all the parts ofthe knights armour with which he casedhimself and his horse in iron so that ashonores he and his steed could hold togetherthey were almost invulnerable tillthe lance was wrested from his hand orhis foot ousted from the stirrup theunited weight of man and horse or theirjoint momentum was of great consequenceas the heavier they were the greater theshock with which they came against theiradversary horse to horse and man to manharry and lucy were glad to know theexact appearance of all these things ofwhich they had read in history as beingused not only in battles but in the justand tournaments of former dayslucy enjoyed them from the recollectionthey brought to her mind of many passagesin poetry and from the pleasure shealways felt in whatever filled her imaginationharry's mechanical taste was gratifiedby examining the ancient coat of mail orhauberk consisting of small steel ringslinked together or interwoven in the mannerthat some ingenious purses of steelrings are made at this dayafter harry had satisfied his curiositysir rupert took him on to those later inventionswhich made of no avail helmand hauberk's twisted mail he showedhim some of the first rude attempts at firearms the arquebuse or long gun describedby froissart used with a rest uponwhich it was supported and with a sort ofshelterpiece to protect the match fromwet and wind between this first clumsyattempt to execute that grand inventionand the perfected wanton's and forth'sguns of our own times various improvementswere made some of which sir rupert explainedto harry lucy whose curiositywas not only satisfied but satiated wentoff to seek for amusement and informationmore interesting to her in the garden andthe conservatory with her mother andlady digby indefatigably kind sir rupertended by finding froissart for harryin the library and unfolding for him thosedelightfully entertaining old prints wherethe battles of poictiers and cressy arerepresented so happily though in defianceof all the laws of perspectiveafter speaking of the wonderful changewhich the introduction of firearms producedin the world and of the astonishmentwhich their first appearance createdamong civilized and uncivilized nations ineurope and america sir rupert relatedto harry an account which he had justread in a new book of travels of a peopleby whom the power of firearms has beeneven recently defied between the nile and the desert saidsir rupert there is a narrow strip ofcultivated land which in some places isnot more than half a mile in breadth butwhich stretches hundreds of miles in lengththis strip of land was inhabited by variousindependent tribes till within the last threeor four years when a despotic turkishpasha of the name of mahomet aliresolved to send a large army under thecommand of his son ismael to subduethem ismael's progress was unresistedtill he came to one warlike tribe whowith equal courage and patriotism defiedthe invader he may drive us to thegates of the world but we will never submitwas the answer they sent to histhreatsbrave people cried harry ihope they drove him back again they were heard shouting from theirencampment continued sirrupert youmay come against us from the north andfrom the east and from the west but wewill never submit they knew that thepacha had firearms they had none but they put their trust in the weapons andshields to which they had been accustomedand in their own courage theirshields of hippopotamus or of crocodileskin covered the head and the breasttheir weapons were swords and lancesand their sorcerers assured them that theirshields and themselves should be renderedby magic invulnerable to masque ballsbravely they came out to give himbattle and advanced boldly at first butwhen the vollies of musketry began toplay and when they found that in spite oftheir promised invulnerability many fellwounded and killed a panic seized themand they fled after this first defeat howeverthey entrenched themselves in theirmountains their courage revived andagain they sent forth shouts of defiancebidding the pacha to come if he daredbut ismael had learned to respect theirbravery he had once already been surprisedand almost defeated by the blackhorsemen of the desert and he thereforeprudently resolved to attack them with aheavy fire of shot and shells one of theseshells fell amongst them and as it wasrolling and bounding along these poorignorant people gathered round it admiringand amused by its motions butwhen it burst and spread destruction roundit they cried out the evil spirits arecome against us and are too mighty for usthe superstition that had at first giventhem confidence now only increased theirdespair and abandoning their strongholdsthey set off in full flight theirpatriotism expiring with their libertiesafterwards they bargained for their wretchedlives and were contented to join as hissoldier slaves the army of their conqueroras sir rupert concluded harry groanedwas this said he the end of theirglorious you may drive us to the gatesof the world but we will never submiteven so harry so little dependencecan there be on mere animal ignorantcourage thatbraves the danger of whichit does not know the nature or extentthe glass doors at one end of the libraryleading into the conservatory were halfopen and now that harry's attention wasno longer engaged he observed a gale offragrance like the smell of fresh hay orof that grass which gives to fresh hay itspleasant odour anthoxanthum odoratuma second waft however decided that itwas from lady digby's favourite plantthe heliotrope innumerable pots of whichthe skilful old gardener contrived to forceinto premature flower and perfume so as tohave a constant succession for her ladyship'sconservatory he heard lucy's voice too and though he was not as he used to sayof himself a great greenhouse merchanthe now went in there and foundlady digby showing some plants whichhad been lately sent to her from northcarolina by a kind american lady therewas one which is rather uncommon inthese countries as it is so delicate thatwithout care it seldom survives a winter inour climates it is something of thenature of the sensitive plant the insideof the leaf is thickly set with bristly hairslike thorns or like many little sharp teethas soon as lucy saw this plant she tookup a straw and drew it along the divisionor middle rib of one of its leaves andimmediately the two sides of the leaf foldedup and the prickly teeth closed togetherso as to hold fast the strawi see it is the plant i thought of saidlucy venus's flytrap is not it yes dioncba muscular said ladydigby have you seen one before no lucy had never seen one but sheknew it she said from having read adescription of it the gardener by thistime had caught a fly of which he badbeen in search on the window for sometime for flies were few and rare at thisseason and holding his struggling prisonerby the two wings he was going toset him upon one of the leaves that theyoung lady as he said might see whatwould happen but lucy stopped his handshe knew what would happen thatthe moment the fly touched the leaf theteeth would close upon it as they hadclosed on the straw and squeeze it todeath the old gardener immediatelycomplied with lucy's entreaties to releasethe poor fly and lucy observed to himthat there was the less occasion for thisexperiment as the many dead flies showedhow well some of the leaves had performedtheir cruel office but i really thinkshe said that those flykilling leaves arelarger and greener than the restthe gardener answered that he hadoften remarked the same thing and thoughsome folk said that they were fattened andnourished by the dead flies for his parthe thought it just as likely that it was becausethe healthy and vigorous leaves hada greater power of shutting close andcrushing the flies but added he withvol iii odue philosophic caution i can't takeupon me to decideharr admired the ingenious mechanicalstructure of this flytrap and began tosay that it reminded him of somethingwhich he had seen elsewhere when lucysmiled and said i know what you aregoing to say harry and you are quiteright you mean the plant called the flycatcher a sort of arum which smells asyou said harry like a dead horse andthere is another plant in which mammashowed me the same sort of contrivancecontinued lucy but i cannot recollectits long latin name i rememberthat papa lent me a magnifying glass tolook at the dead flies lying at the bottomof its flowers some were held by theproboscis and some by the legs thisplant is called in english i believe dog'sbanewas not this what you were thinkingof harry no i was not thinking of any plant'said harry i was thinking of a machinea sort of trap which catches rats in themanner that this catches flieslucy was a little scandalized by thisinelegant comparison the flytrap of venus compared to arattrap but on harry's appeal to hisfather it was allowed to be just as far asmechanics gothe gardener thought it was now histurn to get in a few words in praise of thestrength and healthiness of his dionaeait had been sent over from carolina insods of its native earth which still remainedin a box to which he pointedthere were more plants in it said he but they have died so i shall emptyout the sods now for they are a disfigurementhere'harry said it would be a pity to throwthis earth away for he recollected havingheard that when the boxes of plantswhich peruse in his voyage round theworld sent home to france were openedthe plants and shrubs in some were deadyet the gardener did not throw away theo earth but preserved it carefully becausehe thought it might contain the seeds ofsome sorts of plants unknown perhaps inthese countries and so it provedlady digby upon hearing this circumstancedesired her gardener to put theamerican earth into small pots and toplace them in a hot bed if it shouldproduce any plants that are worth youracceptance harry said she you towhom shall owe them shall share themwith memayhap master you might not knowwhat this is said the gardener openinganother little box and putting into hishands a small bundle of what seemed toharry to be black horsehair is it horsehair said harry it is horsehair said lucyno miss no master though i tookit myself for that at first unpackinglucy pulled a bit of it out and afterfeeling said it feels like horsehaircrisp and springy and it looks so like it thati can hardly believe it is not horsehair never was on a horse's back missnor ever belonged to any animalis it animal or vegetable said lucythat was soon settled by harry's runningback to the library and burning a bitof it the remains he held to lucy's noseand its smell convinced her of that whichher eyes had failed to discover that it wasneither horsehair nor any animal substance then it is a vegetable whatcan it be and what do you think this can bemiss said the gardener putting into herhand another little bundle of somethingwhich harry said looked like ends of whitecoarse thread such as he had seen in ataylor's shop and which he had heardcalled thrums lucy agreed that it waslike tangled housewife's thread but on anearer view she who was more knowingin housewifery than harry pronounced thatit certainly was not thread looking atwhat harry drew out and called a needlefullshe observed sundry little short filamentsor stalks and at the end of some ofthem were little knobs which on furtherexamination were evidently the remains ofvery small flowers she pronounced ittherefore to be a vegetable and she wassurprised to hear that both this and whatshe had called black horsehair were oneand the same thing only in different statesi will if you please said lady digbyread to you the account that i receivedfrom the american friend who sent themto meshe returned to the library to look forthe letter in her writingdesk and harryand lucy stuck close to her much afraidthat the letter might not be forthcoming but she found it and read as follows the foliage of several trees herenear wilmington in north carolinahas in some situations a singular appearancea sort of long grey moss suspendsitself from the branches and wavingin the wind gives the trees a hoary andto me not uninteresting appearance whenstripped of its external coat this mossnearly resembles horsehair it is elected for that purpose in large quantitiesand buried in marshy spots and when theouter coat peels off the inner part is driedand cleaned and makes excellent mattresseslucy's mother observed that the outercoat of flax is destroyed in the same wayby steeping it in waterlucy inquired whether this kind of horsehairmoss as she called it had any name and whether it was known in england orwas a new discovery sir rupert digbytold her that though he had never beforeseen this extraordinarily fibrous species yethe was aware that the genus or family ofplants to which it belonged had been wellknown to linnaeus who had given it asingular name from a singular circumstanceit will make me remember the singularname said lucy if you will beso good as to tell me the singular circumstance you must know then said sir rupert that among the early botanists of swedenthere was a certain doctor who having inhis youth had an unfavourable voyage bywater from abo where he lived to stockholmmade a vow the moment he set hisfoot on dry land that he would never againventure himself upon the sea he keptthis vow so scrupulously that when he wasto return home he took a roundaboutjourney of several hundred miles to avoida passage of a few hours by water hishatred of water and his love of the dryland rose to such a pitch that he laidaside his family name to take that of tillandswhich in swedish means on landyou think perhaps and so do i that thisdoctor made a rash vow and did not in allthis show much sense but a man maybeweak in some things and wise in othershe was wise in botany and made an excellentcatalogue of all the wild plants inthe neighbourhood of his residence inhonour of which and of the whimsicalname he had adopted linnaeus gave thename of tillandsia to this genus of plantsas they are remarkable for their dislike ofwater lucy do you think you will nowbe able to remember the nametillandsiai think i am sure i shall saidlucysir rupert further told lucy that oneof the most severe censors of linnaeus hadbeen so much pleased with the happychoice of this name that he declared hewould excuse in linnaeus a thousandfaults for that fact alonelady digby said her american friendhad been so obliging as to send manyother curious things in the box besidesthe specimen of this moss amongothers i am sure lucy you will like tosee some pods of cotton in their differentstages of ripening my friend tells methat they grow on a bush from two to fourfeet high and that the flower is of a delicatestraw colour i dare say you mayhave seen an engraving of iti think i have said lucy buioh lady digby before you shut the boxwill you give me leave to look at thatgreen leaf if it is a leaf you do well to say if it is a leafanswered lady digby do you knowwhat it is is it the creeping leafy said lucyno answered lady digby itmuch resembles the creepingleaf or mantisstrumaria but this is a different insectby the country people in america it iscalled the candid from the sound of itschirping resembling the frequent repetitionof candid candidlucy examined this insect more closelyit was about the size of a roseleaf of thepale green colour of the inside of a peapod and apparently of that smooth texture but upon looking at it with a magnifyingglass lucy saw that what hadappeared like the veins of a leaf were theribs or sinews of the wings and in theintermediate spaces which had to thenaked eye appeared perfectly smooth shenow saw embossed innumerable littlespots looking like shagreennow i see the animal's head wherethe footstalk of the leaf seemed to be andits eyes nose and mouth cried lucy pray look harry its head and faceare like a horse's head and face in bodyclothes look at its protuberant bladderlookingeye the mouth however is likea pig's or the antbear's and round itsneck it has a curious worked pelerinestanding up like the leather hood on thecollar of a waggon horse but whatcurious thing is that lying loose in the boxwith its green longjointed storklike legs what do they belong to before her question could be answeredher rambling eye fixed with delight andcuriosity on a plant which hung flauntingfrom the top of the conservatory sheasked where its roots were how it wasnourished or whether it lived on airladydigby answered that it was reputedto live on air as its name of jos aris orthe airplant shows and that probably itderives its nourishment from the moisturein the air however this may be inits native country it thrives much betterhere if planted in a little light earth oreven in wet moss as you may perceiveby comparing it with the other specimenswhich you see twined round thatpillar and which are all planted in potsthis plant nevertheless has been hangingwhere you see it for four months andthough it requires a much greater heat it isquite alive it is frequently watered and iwant to try how long it will live in that situationbut continued lady digby ifyou my dear lucy who are so active andobliging will run up stairs to the littleturret within my room you will find abook with many paper marks in it on mydesk bring it down to me and it willtell you something more about this curiousplantlucy vanished and reappeared bearingin her hand the proof of her swift errandthis is a favourite book of mine andof my son edward's all these marks heput in for my edification i was no botanistbut he and this little volume togetherhave made me fond of what appears to methe most interesting and rational part of thestudy that which opens to our view thecurious and useful structure of plants andthe progress of vegetation i like thisbook for another reason continued ladydigby turning to lucy's mother whichmakes me rejoice that it pleases youngpeople without any ostentation of religioussentiment it really inspires it in thebest and happiest manner here is theaccount of the jos aeris continued ladydiobv will you read it to us it isvery shortlucy read there is one species ofthe epidendrum family the jos aris anative of india that deserves to be particularlydistinguished it is so called becauseit grows and blossoms when suspendedin the air and we are assuredthat hanging from the ceiling of a roomit will vegetate for years it is likewisesaid to be remarkably reviving to the inhabitantsby the fine odour of its blossomsthat fact said lucy's father of itshanging from the ceiling of a room andvegetating for a length of time in thatmanner is mentioned if i recollect rightlyin one of sir william jones's letters writtenwhen he was in india he says theflos aris was at that instant suspendedover his head that he had tied its rootlessbranches to the beams of the roof andhe speaks with delight of the charmingfragrance of the blossomsand now said sir rupert praymay i ask i have been very patient whileyou ladies have had the book to yourselveswith three pairs of hands upon itat once may i ask the name of this favouritebook if name it have for hithertoi have heard it called only it or the bookor my favourite book has it a nameit has a name answered lady and a name that will be well knownto fame in due time dialogues on botanynext morning after breakfast an expresscame from the housekeeper's room to informlucy that the canarybird was beginningto draw up his bucket downstairsshe ran immediately and after herfollowed harrythe thirsty little fellow nowe working forhis own interest and with his own goodwillsoon performed his task and earnedhis thimblefull duly raised when liftedto the proper height he held it by keepingthe collected chain fast under one footthen he dipped shook his beak anddipped and shook again much to his owndelight and to that of the spectatorswhen he had fully satisfied his thirst hebegan to favour the company with a sono but his notes even when joy tuned histhroat were so loud and shrill that hismistress the housekeeper soon threw awhite handkerchief over the top of hiscage to reduce him to silence so that asshe said she might hear somebody speakbesides himlady digby who had followed lucyto see her friend the canarybird performits little exercises confirmed lucy's hopesthat birds may be taught by gentle methodswhen young many of those featswhich are generally acquired by the inflictionof so many tortures she hadwhen abroad as she told lucy knowna german musicmaster who was very fondof birds and who was most expert inteaching them he assured her that hehad himself instructed a bullfinch which hewould venture to say was as accomplishedas any of its kind in all germany wherethese birds are chiefly born and bred andhe had never used hot knitting needle orany other instrument of torture in its education only soft words and sometimes heacknowledged a little wholesome fastinglady digby recollected that this judiciousbirdfancier or birdinstructor furthertold her that he always taught hispupil at the dead still hour of midnightor when all the rest of the family wereasleep and when there was nothing todistract the bird's attention then hewould play tunes for him on the violinthe bullfinch seemed to take no noticeand never attempted at the time to followhim but the next day he would practise byhimself and at last bring out the tune hehad heard at nightlucy's attention was now called off toa basket of lavender which a maid at thisinstant brought into the room the housekeeperwas going to make her annual storeof lavenderwater the still was readyand lucy wished to see the operation ofdistilling but harry whispered his adviceto her to wait and see it performed in thelaboratory looking out of the window tothe other side of the court he observed thatthe iron door was open which was a signthat sir rupert was in the laboratory andon this hint lucy immediately ran therewithharry and found sir rupert andtheir fatherfortunately for lucy sir rupert wantedfor the experiment he was then trying tohave some water that should be perfectlypure that is quite free from all mixtureof earth or salts or other substances andfor which purpose it was to be distilledthis was a simple process which lucycould understand sir rupert had justprepared his alembic the apparatus usuallyemployed in distillation for chemical purposesit was a pearshaped glass vesselinto which the liquor to be distilled wasput a lamp was placed underneath bythe heat of which the liquor was madeto boil and the vapour that rose was condensedin the cover which was a conicalshapedcap of metal with a beak or spoutthat sloped downwards into another vesselcalled the receivedthese drops said sir rupert whichyou see running ois from the beak arecollected in the receiver and the liquorthus collected is said to be distilledall distillation is performed upon this principlethough the apparatus is differentfor different purposes and sometimes madeof copperi have heard of a worm used in a stillwhat is that said lucythe worm is a spiral tube so calledfrom its resembling the form of a worm its use in the still is the same as that ofthe cap over this alembic to condense thehot vapourlucy asked why the worm was usedinstead of the cap because said sir rupert it exposesmore cold surface to the vapoursuppose the whole pipe to be unwoundand laid open you would then perceivewhat a large surface there would be besideswhich the colder the worm is keptthe quicker the condensation proceeds and a worm or a long pipe coiled up isvery conveniently placed in a vessel ofcold water which may be changed wheneverit becomes warmed by the hot vapourthat communicates its heat to the metalworm i understand it now thank you sirsaid lucyshe perceived that in fact though theapparatus was different the thing donewas no more than what she had formerlyseen when she was six years old when thecold plate was held over the vapour ofboiling water that issued from the top ofthe tea urn she recollected something ofthe account of distillation and sublimationin conversations on chemistry andsearching for the book in the library sherefreshed her memory by reading the passagesover again at this moment when shehad the advantage of seeing the realthings and perhaps of seeing the experimentstriedshe there found that sublimation is thename given to the process of distillationwhen applied to solid substancessublimation a sandbath flowers ofsulphur she repeated wishing earnestlythat she could see all these thingssir rupert said that as the sandbathwas now heated over his little stove forhis own experiments he could easily gratifyher curiosity if she pleased he wouldhowever instead of flowers of sulphur lether see flowers of benzoinhe put into her hand a small lump ofa brownish substance which he told herwas benzoin and that it was a res'm ormore properly a balsam obtained fromcertain trees which grow in the east indieschiefly in the island of sumatra fromthis substance flowers of benzoin are obtainedby sublimation in the same manneras flowers of sulphur are produced lucywatched the processthe benzoin was put into the glassalembic which was placed in the sandbathand this she saw was merely a castironvessel containing a quantity of sandsir rupert explained to her that the heatwas more uniform and could be better regulatedby means of the hot sand andthat there was less danger to the glassthan if it were exposed to the direct heatof the fire he told her also that chemistsmake much use of a bath of boilinor water and that in some arts tempering certainkinds of springs for instance workmenuse baths of melted lead or tin or someother fusible substance because the exacttemperature at which these metals meltbeing known the proper heat may be appliedwith the greatest precisionin a short time the benzoin began toswell the resinous parts and other impuritieswith which it had been combinedremained at the bottom of the alembicbut the volatile parts flew off and werecondensed by the cold cap these werethe flowers and were different from whatlucy expected to see they were morelike flakes of snow than any thing else towhich she could compare them whileshe was looking at them harry ran outinto the yard to the gardener's boy whomhe saw coming in from the garden with abasket of herbs on his arm from hisbasket harry plucked a sprig of rosemaryand returning without letting lucy seewhat he had in his hand he sprinkled itover with flowers of benzoin and then heldit before her eves it looks exactly as if it were coveredwith hoar frost cried lucy howbeautiful i shall never forget this harrybut here are the horses coming out forsir rupert and papa to ride and so thereis an end of all things at least in the laboratoryfor this daybattledore and shuttlecock was kept upone rainy morning by harry and lucy believe it who may boast as much whocan two thousand three hundred andtwentyfour times they had also manya game of ninepins in the great hallwhere prolonged by its echoes was oftenheard the heart's light laugh at the fall ofthe merry men allbut all these the promised joys of castle each proving greater in the enjoymentthan the promise were exceededby the delights of the workshop and laboratoryevery morning they watched forthe moment when sir rupert moved towardsthe iron door avicenna neverwatched more anxiously the famous librarydoor that opened but once a yearone morning lucy observed a shallowdrawer on the table between her fatherand sir rupert and in this she saw somethings which she thought might be veryuseful to harry the drawer containedmany lenses of telescopes and glasses ofdifferent sizes some as large as that ofharry's camera obscura which had beenso unfortunately broken it occurred tolucy that the loss might now be repairedshe waited till sir rupert was not busyand then she asked him whether theseglasses were very precious too precious topart with or whether she might beg onefor harry sir rupert said that theywere precious to him because he was repeatingsome beautiful experiments of drbrewster's and mr herschel's on the magnifyingpowers of telescopes but he desiredto know which lucy wished for as possiblythat one might be sparedshe looked at the variety that lay beforeher but which of them she wanted shecould not tell it was in vain to consulther father's eye it never moved sirrupert stood by with his goodnaturedsmile waiting her decision but withoutgiving any direction to her choice if i could but recollect exactly theshape of the old glass in harris's cameraobscura said lucy what i want is aglass that magnifies of that i am surethese which are convex magnify i believebut continued she after having lookedthrough several of them at a word whichwas written in small characters on the frontof the drawer i find that some of theseglasses magnify much more than others and another thing i perceive that as imove each glass nearer or further thereis one particular distance at whichthe object appears distinct but that thedistances are quite different for differentglasses i recollect hearing you papatelling harry something about the focaldistance but i had better not say anythingabout that as i do not understandit i cannot tell which of these convexglasses will suit the camera obscuravol iii phowever i know the sort that i wantshould be convex very well my dear said sir rupertthat is indeed all that you can tell orthat can be known without trial youshall therefore take several of these convexlenses home with you and harry by trialcan determine which will best answer yourpurposelucy was very much obliged to sirrupert and delighted that through hermeans her brother's camera obscura waslikely to be mended but now that hercuriosity was excited she wished to knowmore why papa do convex glasses magnifyand concave glasses diminish iwish i knew i wish i could understandthe camera obscura mamma says thatcamera obscura is italian for dark chamber so far so good for the name saidher father but in this case the nametells us nothing of the nature of the thing yet papa said lucy the firsttime you showed harry and me a cameraobscura it was in a large darkroom was it quite dark said her fathernot quite the shutters were allclosed but there was a little hole in oneof them through which the rays of lightcame we saw images of things veryfaintly upon a white sheet which youhad hung up opposite to the hole whatwe saw was a sort of coloured shadowypicture of the landscape that was outsideof the window and i remember that allthe images were upside downtrue said her father you observedthat it was very faint and indistinctdid it remain sooh no papa it became afterwardsquite distinct and almost as bright as thenatural colours of the trees and orass andwe saw the figures of people as theywalked past in a field at a little distancefrom the window i saw the colour ofthe women's red cloaks and their facesquite plainly and the figures were not upsidedown as beforeand what made these differencesasked her fatherit was a glass a lens you called itwhich you put into that hole in the just the same way as theglass makes the landscape appear brighteron the paper in harry's portable cameraobscura do you recollect how or why the lensproduced this effect said her fatherno papa not exactly harry explainedto me afterwards something aboutit but he could not tell me all he saidhe did not know all thenall no indeed said harry nottien nor nowtell us all you remember if you rememberany thing of what he did explainsaid her father first he told me said lucy whywe see the shapes and colours of thingshe said it was by the rays of light whichcome from themcome from them how said herfather do you mean come out ofthemno papa but the rays of light gofrom the sun and strike upon objects andthen come from them to our eyes or aspeople express it are reflected by thoseobjects harry next told me somethingwhich i thought i understood at the timebut i am not sure that i can explain it try said sir rupertharry showed me in a book an engravingof an eye with lines representingthe rays of light coming from all parts ofan object and meeting in an angle at theeye he told me that objects appear tousgreat or small according to the size ofthat angle next he told me that our eyeis in some way like a camera obscurathere is a little hole in the middlethrough which the rays of light pass asthey passed through the little hole in thewindowshutter into the dark room andafter having crossed each other they makea small picture of the object i do notknow where exactly somewhere at theback of the eye i believe and upsidedown as we saw the objects at first on thewhite sheet but in the eye these picturesmust be extremely small something moreharry said about a part of the eye whichhe called the crystalline humour andabout the rays of light being bent as theypass through it which i think he calledbeing refracted but which i did not understandat allsir rupert observed that lucy did wellnot to attempt to go farther than she knewclearly there is hope he said of teachingany thing to those who perceive andacknowledge when they do not clearly understandand who are not satisfied withconfused notions lucy was glad to hearsir rupert say to harry that his littlepupil did him credit and that she was notlike little conceited misses who instead ofwishing to learn in order to improve desireonly to display a smattering of knowledgei am glad my dear lucy added herfather that your curiosity has been raisedon these subjects but we cannot at presentassist you further only keep whatyou have steadily in your mind and fromthat you may go on hereafter withharry's help assisted by his favourite book scientific dialogues and with your ownattention you may learn what you desirebut not all at once you must not expectto learn optics in one morningend of vol iiilondonprinted by charles woodpopplo
