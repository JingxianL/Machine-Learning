cleoneanaxagoras told me yesterday that he hadbeen conversing with some literary men philosophersand poets who agreed in one thingonly which is that we are growing worse dayafter day both in morality and intellect hintswere thrown out that philosophy had mistakenher road and that it was wonderful how shecould be at once so dull and so mischievousthe philosophers themselves made this com pericles and aspasiaplaint the poets were as severe on poetry andwere amazed that we were reduced so low as tobe the hearers of sophocles and euripides andthree or four more who however were quitegood enough for such admirersit is strange said anaxagoras that weareunwilling to receive the higher pleasureswhen they come to us and solicit us and whenwe are sure they will do us great and lastinggood and that we gape and pant after thelower when we are equally sure they will do usgreat and lasting evil i am incapable continuedhe of enjoying so much pleasure fromthe works of imagination as these poets arewho would rather hate euripides and sophoclesthan be delighted by them yet who follow theshade of orpheus with as ardent an intensity oflove as orpheus followed the shade of eurydiceignorant as i am of poetry i dared not hazardthe opinion that our two contemporaries werepericles and aspasia really deserving of more commendation on thescore of verse inferior as they might be tomarshal and thamyris and the centaur chiron and to the philosophers i could only say mydear friends let us keep our temper firmly andour tenets laxly and let any man correct bothwho will take the troublei come to you aspasia to console me forthe derision i bring home with mei kissed his brow which was never sereneand assured him that he possessed more comfortthan any mortal could bestow upon him andthat he was the only one living who neverwanted anyi am not insensible said he that everyyear at my time of life we lose some pleasure some twig that once blossomed cankersi never was fond of looking forward i haveinvariably checked both hopes and wishes itis but fair then that i should be allowed to turn pericles and aspasiaaway my eyes ftxm the prospect of age even ifi could believe that it would come to me asplacidly as it has come to anaxagoras i woiildrather lie down to sleep before the knees trembleas they bend with anaxagoras i neverconverse in this manner for old men morewillingly talk of age than hear others talk of it and neither fool nor philosopher likes to thinkof the time when he shall talk no longer i toldmy dear old man that having given a piece ofmoral to the philosophers he must not be sounjust as to refuse a like present to the poetsabout an hour before i began my letter hecame into the library and to my great surprisebrought me these verses telling me that if theywere

bore the loss tolerably welluntil the romans so they call themselves wentbeyond all bounds and even took their cattlefrom the yoke the sabines had endured allthat it became them to endure but the lowingof their oxen from the seven hills reached theirhearts and inflamed them with revenge theyare a pastoral and therefore a patient peopleable to undergo the exertions and endure theprivations of

services were rendered by the son of deparatusand that the calendar might have beenmade better were it not requisite on such anoccasion more than almost any other to consultthe superstition of the populacei myself am afraid of touching the calendarhere in athens many as have been my conferenceswith meton on the subject done itshall be but it must be either just before avictory or just afterif the sabine had sent an embassy or evenan individual to athens in order to collect ourlaws the archives of the city would retain a recordof so wonderful an event he certainlycould not have picked them up in the pasturesor woodlands of his own country but the corinthiansknow them well and have copied mostof them all nations are fond of pushing thepericles and aspasia date of their civilisation as high up as possibleand care not how remotely they place the benefitsthey have received and as probablysome of the romans were aware that numawas their conqueror they helped to abolish thehumiliating suspicion by investing him successivelywith the robes of a priest of a legislatorand of an astronomerhis two nearest successors were warriorsand conquerors the third was the son of thatdemaratus of whom we have spoken and whoexiled from corinth settled among the tyrreland afterwards being rich and eloquentwon over to his interests the discontented and thevenal of the romans at all times a great

hurdles and mud upon ruins of pericles and aspasiamassy workmanship that the best houses wereroofed with rushes and that the vases of thetemples were earthen now kings in generaland mostly those whose

their hands on surely so consideratea person as the son of demaratuswould have adapted his magnificence to thegenius of the people who never cared aboutfilth but were always most zealous in their devotionsthis we might imagine would occurto him as more and more requisite on the captureof every town or village for when thepericles and aspasia romans had killed the inhabitants they transferredthe gods very diligently into their citythat they might not miss their worshippersnow the gods must have wanted room by degreesand might not have liked their quartersfive hundred temples

nothing ineurope is so vast and so wellconstructed asthe sewer at rome excepting only the harbourwallsand propylaea built recently here atathens under the administration of periclesi have asked him

the great sewer ofrome was constructed i am desirous of establishingone opinion in prejudice of anotheror forward in denying that a rich corinthianmight have devised so vast an undertakingbut in corinth herself we find nothing of equalmagnitude nothing at all resembling its architecture the tuscanss who are stated to havebeen employed in building it have ceased formany ages to be capable of

months with little advantage toeither side and much distress to both whatour historian has read to us does not containany part of these transactions which howeverhe carefully notes down as they occur

athenian character painted insuch true and lively colours in compositionhischaracteristick is brevity yet the first sene pericles and aspasiatetice of the runs into superfluity thewords to the best of my recollection arethesethucydides of athens has composed a historyof the war between the peloponnesian andatheniansthis is enough yet he adds as conducted by each of the belligerentsof course it could not be conducted by oneonlyi observed that in the fourth sentence hewent from the third person to the firstby what i could collect he thinks the peloponnesianwar more momentous than the persian

the north macedoniansand others with strange names we havepericles and aspasia no great reason to fear it although the policyof thebes on whom much depends is ungenerousand unwisehe said moreover that transactions of anearlier time are known imperfectly and wereof small importance either in the wars or anythingelseyet without these wars or some other ofthese transactions our miletus and athens ourpericles and thucydides would not be somuch does one thing depend upon another iam little disposed to overvalue the potencyand importance of the eastern monarchies butsurely there is enough to excite our curiosityand interest our inquiries in the fall of chaldeathe rise of babylon and the mysteries ofegypt not indeed her mysteries in theologywhich are impostures there as elsewhere butthe mysteries in arts and sciences which willoutlive the gods barbarians do not hold pericles and aspasiasteadily before us any moral or political lesson but they serve as graven images protuberanteminent and gorgeously uncouth to support thelamp placed on them by history and philosophyif we knew only what they said anddid we should turn away with horrour anddisgust but we pound their mummies tocolor our narratives and we make them asuseful in history as beasts are in fablethucydides shews evidently by his preliminaryobservations that he considers the trojanwar unimportant yet according to homerthe grecian troops amounted to above a hundredthousand in reality so large a force hathnever been assembled in any naval expeditionnor even one half how was it provisioned ataulis how on the shores of the road andall these soldiers with chariots and horses wereembarked for troy a few years after the first shipof war left the shores of greece yes a very fewpericles and aspasia years indeed for the argo had among her crewthe brothers of helen who cannot well be supposedto have been ten years older than herselfit is of rare occurrence even in the climate ofsparta that a mother bears children after solong an interval and we have no reason to believethat such a time had elapsed between thebrothers and their sister suppose the twins tohave been twentytwo years old for they hadbecome celebrated for horsemanship and boxingand helen seventeen for her daughter was aninfant and such beauty must have been soughtearly in marriage you will find utile space leftbetween the expeditionsbut away with calculation we make a badbargain when we change poetry for truth in theaffairs of ancient times and by no means agood one in anyremarkable men of remote ages are collectedtogether out of different countries within the pericles and aspasiasame period and perform simultaneously thesame action on an accumulation of obscuredeeds arises a wild spirit of poetry and imagesand names burst forth and spread themselveswhich carry with them something like enchantmentfar beyond the infancy of nations whatwas vague imagination settles at last and is receivedfor history it is difficult to effect andidle to attempt the separation it is like breakingoff a beautiful crystallization from the vaultof some intricate and twilight cavern out ofmere curiosity to see where the accretion terminatesand the rock beginsaspasia to cleonewe have tost another poet and have noneleft besides the comick euripides is gone topericles and aspasia the court of archelaus a very few years agohe gained the prize against all competitors hewas hailed by the people as a deliverer for subvertingthe ascendency and dominion which sophocleshad acquired over them the atheniansdo not like to trust any man with powerfor life sophocles is now an old man sixtyyears of age at the least and he had then beenabsolute in the theater for above a quarter of acentury what enthusiasm what acclamations for overthrowing the despot who had so oftenmade them weep and beat their breasts hecame to visit us on the day of his defeat euripideswas with us at the timeeuripides said he we are here aloneexcepting

have been very gloriousi never saw pericles more moved theseare the actions that shake his whole frame andmake his eyes glisten euripides was less affectedhe writes tenderly but is not tenderthere are hearts that call for imagination there are others that create iti must abstain from all reflections that falltoo darkly on the departed we may see himno more perhaps i am sorry for it he didnot come often to visit us nor indeed is thereany thing in his conversation to delight or interestme he has not the fine manners of sophoclesnor the open unreserved air whichpericles tells me he admired so much in thesoldierly and somewhat proud eschylus graveand taciturn i hear like himself unless whensomething pleased him and then giving way toebullitions and bursts of rapture and fillingevery one with it round aboutpericles and aspasia the movers and masters of our souls havesurely a right to throw out their urbs as carelesslyas they please on the world that belongsto them and before the creatures they haveanimated it is only such insects as petty autocratthat feel opprest by it and would stingthem for it pericles is made of the same clayhe cannot quite overcome his stateliness buthe bends the more gracefully for bendingslowlywhen i think of euripides i think how shorta time it is since he was hailed as a deliverer and how odious he is become for breaking inupon our affections at an unseasonable hourand for carrying our hearts into captivity allthe writers of the day were resolved to humblehim and ran about from magistrate to magistrateto raise money enough for the magnificentrepresentation of his rival i have forgottenthe man's name pericles never thwarts theb pericles and aspasiapassions and prejudices of the citizens in hisadolescence he visited the humble

conpericlesand aspasia tinned to abstain as they had ever done fromall alliances they only sought ours whendestruction was imminent knowing that inpolicy and humanity we never could allow theextinction of one grecian state nor consequentlythe aggrandisement and preponderanceof another and least so when the insolence ofcorinth had threatened our naval ascendancyby which all greece was saved and the rivalryof lacedsemon our equality on land by ourtreaty with the lacedaemonianss it is providedthat if any community be not in alliance withone of the parties it may confederate witheither at its discretion and this compact itwas agreed should be binding not only on theprincipals but likewise on the subordinates insuch a predicament stands corcyrait might behove us to chastise the inhumanityof a nation which like corinth would devourher own offspring but it certainly is most justs pericles and aspasiaand most expedient when instead of reasoningor conferring with us on the propriety of ourinterference she runs at once to sparta conspiringwith her to our degradation and ifpossible to our ruin satisfactorily to demonstrateour justice and moderation i advise thatwe stipulate with corcyra for mutual defencenever for aggression and admitting no articlewhich even by a forced interpretation may contraveneour treaty with lacedsemonsecond speech of periclesthe jealousy that sparta hath ever entertainedagainst us was declared most flagrantlywhen leotychides who commanded the grecianforces at mycale drew away with him all theconfederates of the peloponese we continuedpericles and aspasia to assail the barbarians until we drove themfrom sestos their last hold upon the hellespontit was then and then only that the atheniansbrought back again from miserable refuge theirwives and children and began to rebuild theirhabitations and walls for their defence didthe spartans view this constancy and perseverancewith admiration and with pity as thepatriotick the generous the humane would do did they send embassadors to congratulate yourfathers on their valour their endurance theirprosperous return their ultimate security embassadors they sent indeed but insistingthat our walls should never rise again from theirruins a proposal so unjust and arrogant wetreated with scorn and indignation when ournumbers were diminished and our wealth exhaustedshall we bend to their decisions andobey their orders now if their power of injuringus were in proportion to their malice pericles and aspasiatheir valour to their pride or their judgment totheir ferocity then

what was the consequence a ten years siege and these oathenians are the men who now threaten theacropolis and piraeus i can compare the lacedaemonianss to nothingmore fitly than to the heads of spears withoutthe shafts there would be abundantly thepower of doing mischief were there only themeans and method of directing it wherethese are wanting we have no better cause forpericles and aspasia

three are mistaken now than that youall together with your fathers and best friendswhose natal days and days of departure fromus you still keep holy have been always so hermippus and diopithes seeing

pericles witha smile i hope no other athenian is cursedwith a wife liable to so grievous an accusationscoffer cried diopithes dare you denythat in the summer of this very year when you pericles and aspasiawere sailing to lay waste the coasts of the peloponese you attempted to pervert the religion ofthe sailors the sun was suddenly bedimmed darkness came over the sea as far even as untoour city the pilot fell upon his face andprayed and did not you o pericles raise himup with one hand and throwing your mantleover his eyes with the other ask whether hefound any thing dreadful in it and when heanswered in his piety it is not that's did notyou reply the other darkness is no otherwise differentthan in its greater extent and produced bysomewhat larger than my mantle proceed to interrogate said periclesanswer that first o sacrilegious man exclaimed diopithesathenians said pericles many of youhere present were with me in the expeditiondo assure diopithes that it was not mypericles and

not only did thesun shine out again bright and serene as everbut the winds were favorable the voyage prosperousthe expedition successfulit appears to me that the gods are the mostangry when they permit the malicious and thefalse to prevail over the generous and simplehearted when they permit the best affectionsto be violated and the worst to rise up in disorderto our ruin nor do i believe that theyare very well pleased at hearing their actionsand motives called in question or at winks andintimations that they want discernment to findout offenders and power and justice to punishthem

arrogant impetuous and inconsistentpericles was always desirous that heshould study oratory in order that it might keephim at home gratify his vanity the most perfectlyand compendiously and render himmaster of his own thoughts and those of othershe plainly told pericles that he could learnlittle from him except dissimulationeven that replied pericles is useful andnecessary it proceeds from selfcommand simulationon the contrary is falsehood andeasily acquired by the meanest intellect apowerful man often dissembles he stands erectin the course of glory with open brow but withbreath supprest the feebler mind is ready totake refuge in its poverty under the sordid garbof whining simulationhe then remarked to pericles that his oratorywas somewhat like his economy wantingin copiousness and displaypericles and aspasia alcibiades said my husband it is particularlythis part of it which i could wish youto adopt in oratory there are few who canafford to be frugal in economy there are fewwho can afford to act otherwise than frugallyi am a publick man and it little becomes meto leave room for suspicion that by managingill my own small affairs i may be negligent inthe greater of the commonwealth there arekingdoms in thrace and asia where the caresof government are consigned to ministers orsatraps and where it shall be thought honorableand glorious in one of these functionaries todie in debt after managing the treasury butsurely there is in this no proof whatever that hemanaged it discreetly on the contrary there isa fair presumption that neglecting his householdhe left the community in worse disorderunquestionably he was a dishonest man to incura debt beyond the extent of his estate pericles and aspasiabalance from accumulation in his own housecan hardly be deemed a merit by the most inconsideratein one who can unlock the treasuryto every relative every friend every associateand every dependent such persons willgenerally be found to have been

on thy reeling earth pericles and aspasiaanaxagoras to aspasiait is well that you are removed from the cityand that the enemies of athens pay respecteither to your birthplace or your wisdom eitherto your celebrity or your confidence i rememberthat speaking of the human form and countenanceboth as existing in life and representedin the ideal you remarked that the perfectionof beauty is what is farthest fi'om all similitudeto the brutes surely then in like mannerthe perfection of our moral nature is in our remotenessfrom all similitude to their propensitiesnow the worst propensity of the worstbeasts is bloodshed for which we pursue themas nearly as we can to extermination but whichthey never commit with so little urgency or toso great an extent as we do until we bringourselves at least to an equality with them wepericles and aspasia jcan hardly be said to have made much progressin wisdom it will appear wonderful and perhapsincredible to future generations that whatare now considered the two highest gifts of manoratory and poetry should be employed the onechiefly in exciting the other in emblazoningdeeds of slaughter and devastation if we couldsee in the nature of things a child capable offorming a live tiger and found him exercisinghis power of doing it i think we should say tohimvou might employ your time better child but then aspasia we must not be oratorsnor poets nor hope for any estimation in thestate beware how you divulge this oddopinion or you may be accused as before ofcrimes against the purity of morals against thecustoms of our forefathers and against theestablished and due veneration of the godsi hardly know what i am treading on when i pericles and aspasiamake a single step toward philosophy onsand i fear it is and whether the impressionbe shallow or profound the eternal tide ofhuman passions will cover and efface it thereare many who would be vext and angry at thisand would say in the bitterness of their heartsthat they have spent their time in vain aspasia aspasia they have indeed if they areangry or vext about itanaxagoras to aspasiawe are now so near winter that there maynot be after the vessel which is about to sailany more of them bound for athens all theremainder of the year and who knows whatanother may bring or take away i remain in health but feeble life slips fromme softly and imperceptibly i am unwilling topericles and aspasia tire myself by blowing a fire which must soongo out whether i blow it or not had i anyspecies of curiosity to send you were it pebbleseaweed or new book i would send

garden for some anemones which irecollected to have seen blossoming the otherday it occurred to me that usually they appearin spring so does poetry i will presentto you a little of both for the first

vessels and burn a few villages itis really a hard matter to find a table to writeupon so quick and so complete is the devastationi fancied war had something in it moreanimating and splendid the people of thepeloponese are brave however they sometimesask for their children if very young pericles and aspasiabut never for their lives why cannot we thinkthem as little worth taking as they of

you menoften talk of glorious death of death met bravelyfor your country i too have been warmed bythe bright idea in oratory and poetry bit ah my dear pericles i would rather read it on anancient tomb than a recent onem pericles and aspasupericles to aspasiai had already warned alcibiades of his imprudenceand irregularity your letter willensure his correction the reply he sent meis worthy of a man

not a youth in athensso easily led away by a weaker judgment than hisown he wishes to excell in everything andsucceeded but this wish brings him into contactwith too many and he cannot at presentpericles and aspasia push them off far enough from him to seeplainly and distinctly what they are he willsoon stand above them and know them betteri must leave off the dying call me forthblessings on my aspasia and her little athenianaspasia to cleonethe verses i shall presently write out foryou at the bottom of my letter are composedas you will perceive in the broadest dorianon the extraordinary death of eschylus probablythe unhappy poet was murdered by someenemy or some robber he was found with hisskull fractured and it may be with a tortoisenear him but who in the world can believethat an eagle dropped it from above that thequickest in sight of all animals mistook a baldpericles and aspasiahead for a rock and did ever man walk inthe fields of sicily with his head uncoveredif he did his death might easily be accountedfor without a tortoise or eagle whenever ifind a book containing this gross absurdity iinstantly throw it aside as the effusion of anidle and silly writer and am well assured itmust be incapable of instructing or interestingmethe petulant author of the verses you willfind below is evidently a disappointed poethero and thereon could never treat eschyluswith neglect or with indifference little asmay be our regard and our respect for royaltywe hardly can suppose any king who knowsgreek so barbarous and stupid as to fancy inhimself a nobility more exalted than in aeschylusor gifted by the gods with a higher officethan stewardship to the greatest of men amongwhom he himself is the richestpericles and aspasia bard of eleusis art thou deadso strangely can it bean eagle dropt upon thy heada tortoise no not hethey who devised the fable marr'dthe moral of their song they meant the eagle by the bardbut placed the creature wrongquickest in courts those ever movewhom nature made most slow tortoise wears plumes and springs abovewhile eagle mounts belowalcibiades to periclespray why did you tell phanomachus to stationsome confidential one near me who should be pericles and aspasiaan eternal check on me there is littlechance that i should do any thing extravagantunless the potidseans invite me to dinner andi accept the invitation i will not allow anyman to defend me before i stand in need ofdefence and before i have deserved to save mylife by proving it worth something i shouldquarrel with socrates himself much more withanother presuming to take what belongs tomeof danger or of glory it is not kindin you nor open nor prudent would youwish any one to say pericles takes care ofhis own relatives this ought only to besaid of the vilest men in the worst governmentsand of you until now it never couldbe you have given no such orders in regardto xanthippus he may be as rash and violentas he pleases even here he dares to call meneaniskos and kouridion and ta paidikathis expression was usually reproachful notalways as we see in platorjericles and aspasia by castor if he were not the son of pericleshis being my cousin should not save from astroke of the sabre that fierce disdainful visagei promise you it shall soon be seen which ofus is the braver and the better man i wouldnot say this to you unless that you might lethim know my sentiments i have no wordswritten or spoken for the contumelious mycomplaints are for the ear of those only whoare kind to mepericles to alcibiadesdo not think my alcibiades that i recommendedyou to the guardianship of phanomachus in order that he should exercise over youa troublesome vigilance of controul or indulgetoward you an unmilitary partiality but iam more intimate with him than i am with pericles and aspasiaxenophon or aristophanes or cassiodorus andhaving sons he knows that restraints are oftennecessary on the impatience of military ardouryour letter is a proof that i judged rightlymy praises of your valour are lost amidst thoseof the army and of the city but the delight ithas given me is i am confident one among thethoughts that have assuaged your wounds onyour return the citizens will express their senseof your conductendeavour to prove now that you are acknowledgedto be the first in bravery that you aremore discreet than xanthippus many in everyarmy are so nearly on an equality in courage thatany attempt of theirs to show a superiority isineffectual unbecoming language can neitherprove nor disprove it but must detract from itsworth and merit discretion on the contraryis the sure sign of that presence of mind without these three were appointed to commands withphanomachuspericles and aspasia which valour strikes untimely and impotentlyjudgement alone makes courage available andconciliates power with genius consider thatyou never will have attained the scope of yourambition until you lead and govern those menagainst whom your passions now exasperateyou and unless you do conciliate them younever can induce them to acknowledge yoursuperiority much less submit to your governanceit is best the germs of power shouldspring forth early that they may have timeenough for gaining strength therefore i writeto you no longer as a youth in pupilage butas a candidate for the highest offices of thecommonwealthtry whether your forbearance may not producea better effect on xanthippus than my remonstrancesi write to you rather than tohim because i rely more firmly on your affectionbe worthy of such a secret o alci pericles and aspasiablades and think how highly i must esteemyour prudence and manliness when i delegateto you who are the younger the power of correctingin him the faults which i have beenunable to eradicate or suppress go and inthe spirit with which i send it give my love toxanthippus he may neglect it he may despiseit he may cast it away but i will gatherit all up again for him you must help mealcibiades to periclespericles i was much edified by your letter but pardon me when i came to the close of iti thought you rather mad what said i beard this panther however when i had considered a little moreand a little better on it i went to him and deliveredyour love he stared at me and thenpericles and aspasia desired to see the direction ay said hei remember the handwriting he oftenerwrites to me than i to him i suppose he hasless to do and less to think ofthe few other words he added are hardlyworth the trouble of repetition in fact theywere not very filial dear pericles i wouldlove him were it only out of perversity butbeside all other rights over me you have mademe more disposed than ever to obey you inmaking me more contented with myself as youhave by this commission i may do somethingyet if we can but fumigate or pray away theplague of two thousand four hundred soldierswho landed but forty days before me from thebosphorus under the command of anon sonof nicias

thecity are scarcely more shadows than the livingand yet how bravely they fought to the last ishould have been sorry for them a few monthsago but i have now learned what it is to be asoldier we must rise superior to pain andthen take another flight farther afield andrise superior to pity beside the potidaeanswere traitors and next they were against us and furthermore they were so wicked as to eatone another rather than submit this showstheir malice now we have done nothing halfso bad toward them and i assure you if othersare disposed to such cruelty i will take no partin it for who would
