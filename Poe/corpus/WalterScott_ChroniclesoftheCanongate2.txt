unwilling and unable to attend toreason or argument albany alone calm andcrafty seemed prepared to use their dissatisfactionfor his own purposes and turn each incidentas it should occur to the furtherance of hisown indirect endsthe king's irresolution although it amountedeven to timidity did not prevent his assumingthe exterior appearance of dignity becominghis situation it was only when hardpressed as in the preceding scene that he losthis apparent composure in general he mightbe driven from his purpose but seldom fromhis dignity of manner he received albanydouglas march and the prior those illassortedmembers of his motley council with amixture of courtesy and dignity which remindedeach haughty peer that he stood in the presenceof his sovereign and compelled him todothe beseeming reverencehang received their salutations the kingmotioned them to be seated and they wereobeying his commands when rothsay enteredhe walked gracefully up to his father andkneeling at his footstool requested his blessingrobert with a look in which fondness and sorrowwere ill disguised made an attempt to assumea look of reproof as he laid his hand onthe youth's head and said with a sigh godbless thee my thoughtless boy and make thee awiser man in thy future years amen my dearest father i said rothsayin a tone of feeling such as his happier momentsoften evinced he then kissed the royal handwith the reverence of a son and a subject andinstead of taking a place at the council boardremained standing behind the king's chair insuch a position that he might when he chosewhisper into his father's earthe king then made a sign to the prior ofst dominic to take his place at the table onwhich there were writing materials which ofall the subjects present albany excepted thechurchman was alone able to use the kingthen opened the purpose of their meeting bysaying with much dignityour business my lords respected theseiiuhiippy dissensions in the highlands which welearn by our latest messengers are about to occasionthe waste and destruction of the countryeven within a few miles of this our own courtbut near as this trouble is our ill fate and theinstigation of wicked men have raised up oneyet nearer by throwing strife and contentionamong the citizens of perth and those attendantswho follow your lordships and others ourknights and nobles i must first thereforeapply to yourselves my lords to know why ourcourt is disturbed by such unseemly contendingand by what means they ought to be repressed brother of albany do you tell us firstyour sentiments on this mattersir our royal sovereign and brother saiduic duke being in attendance on your personwhen the fray began i am not acquaintedwith its origin and for me said the prince i heard noworse warcry than a minstrel wench's balladand saw no more dangerous bolts flying thanhazel nutsand i said the earl of march could onl vperceive that the stout citizens of perth had iuchase some knaves who had assumed the bloodyheart on their shoulders they ran too fast tobe actually the men of the earl of douglasdouglas understood the sneer but only repliedto it by one of those withering looks withwhich he was accustomed to intimate his mortalresentment he spoke however with haughtycomposuremy liege he said must of course knowit is douglas who must answer to this heavycharge for when was there strife or bloodshedin scotland but there were foul tongues to aspersea douglas or a douglas's man as havinggiven cause to them we have here goodlywitnesses i speak not of my lord of albanywho has only said that he was as well becomeshim by your grace's side and i say nothingof my lord of rothsay who as befits his rankyears and understanding was cracking nutswith a strolling musician he smiles herehe may say his pleasure i shall not forget atie which he seems to have forgotten but hereis my lord of march who saw my followersflying before the clowns of perth i can tellthat earl that the followers of the bloody heartadvance or retreat when their chieftain commandsand the good of scotland requiresand i can answer exclaimed the equallyproud earl of march his blood rushing intohis face when the king interrupted him peace angry lords said the king andremember in whose presence you stand andyou my lord of douglas tell us if you canthe cause of this mutiny and why your followerswhose general good services we are mostwilling to acknowledge were thus active inprivate brawl i obey my lord said douglas slightlystooping a head that seldom bent i waspassing from my lodgings in the carthusianconvent through the high street of perthwith a few of my ordinary retinue when i beheldsome of the baser sort crowding aroundthe cross against which there were nailed thisplacard and that which accompanies ithe took from a pocket in the bosom of hisbuffcoat a human hand and a piece of parchmentthe king was shocked and agitatedread he said good father prior andlet that ghastly spectacle be removedthe prior read a placard to the followingpurpose inasmuch as the house of a citizen ofperth was assaulted last night being st valentine'seve by a sort of disorderly nightwalkersbelonging to some company of thestrangers now resident in the fair city andwhereas this hand was struck from one of thelawless glimmers in the fray that ensued theprovost and magistrates have directed that itshould be nailed to the cross in scorn andcontempt of those by whom such brawl wasoccasioned and if any one of knightly degreeshall say that this our act is wrongfully donei patrick charteris of kinfauns knight willjustify this cartel in knightly weapons withinthe barrack or if any one of meaner birthshall deny what is here said he shall be metwith by a citizen of the fair city of perth accordingto his degree and so god and stjohn protect the fail city you will not wonder my lord resumeddouglas that when my almoner had read tomethe contents of so insolent a scroll i causedone of my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgracefulto the chivalry and nobility of scotlandwhereupon it seems some of these saucy burgherstook license to hoot and insult the hindmostof my train who wheeled their horses on themand would soon have settled the feud but formy positive command that they should followme in as much peace as the rascally vulgarwould permit and thus they arrived here inthe guise of flying men when with my commandto repel force by force they might haveset fire to the four corners of this wretchedborough and stifled the insolent churls likefoxcubs in a burning brake of furzethere was a silence when douglas had donespeaking until the duke of rothsay answeredaddressing his father since the earl of douglas possesses thepower of burning the town where your graceholds your court so soon as the provost andhe differ about a night riot oi the terms of acartel am sure we ought all to be thankfulthat he has not the will to do so the duke of rothsay said douglas whoseemed resolved to maintain command of histemper may have reason to thank heaven inamore serious tone than he now uses that thedouglas is as true as he is powerful this is atime when the subjects in all countries riseagainst the law we have heard of the insurgentsof the jacquerie in france and of jackstraw and hob miller and parson ballamong the southron and we may be sure thereis fuel enough to catch such a flame were itspreading to our frontiers when i see peasantschallenging noblemen and nailing thehands of the gentry to their city cross i willnot say i fear mutiny for that would be falsebut i foresee and will stand well preparedfor itand why does my lord douglas say answeredthe earl of march that this cartelhas been done by churls i see sir patrickcharteris name there and he i ween is of noehurps blood the douglas himself since hetakes the matter so warmly might lift sirpatrick's gauntlet without soiling of his honourmy lord of march replied douglasshould speak but of what he understands ido no injustice to the descendant of the redrover when i say he is too slight to be weighedwith the douglas the heir of thomasrandolph might have a better claim to be answeredand by ray honour it shall not miss forwant of my asking the grace said the earl ofmarch pulling his glove offstay my lord said the king do us notso gross an injury as to bring your feud tomortal defiance here but rather offer your unglovedhand in kindness to the noble earl andembrace in token of your mutual fealty to thecrown of scotlandnot so my liege answered march yourmajesty may command me to return my gauntletfor that and all the armour it belongs to areat your command while i continue to hold myearldom of the crown of scotland but when iclasp douglas it must be with a mailed baudfarewell my liege my counsels here avail notand those of others are so favourably receivedthat perhaps farther stay were unwholesome formy safety may god keep your highness fromopen enemies and treacherous friends i amfor my castle of dunbar from whence i thinkyou will soon hear news farewell to youmy lords of albany and douglas you areplaying a high game look you play it fairly farewell poor thoughtless prince who artsporting like a fawn within spring of a tiger farewell all george of dunbar sees the evilhe cannot remedy adieu allthe king would have spoken but the accentsdied on his tongue as he received fromalbany a look cautioning him to forbear theearl of march left the apartment receivingthe mute salutations of the members of thecouncil whom he had severally addressed exceptingfrom douglas alone who returned tohis farewell speech a glance of contemptuousdefiancethe recreant goes to betray us to thesouthron he said his pride rests on hispossessing that seaworn hold which can admitthe english into lothian nay look notalarmed my liege i will hold good what i saynevertheless it is yet time speak bat theword my liege say but arrest him andmarch shall not yet cross the earn on his traitorousjourneynay gallant earl said albany who wishedrather that the two powerful lords shouldcounterbalance each other than that one shouldobtain a decisive superiority that were toohasty counsel the earl of march came hitheron the king's warrant of safeconduct and itmay not consist with my royal brother's honourto break it yet if your lordship can bringany detailed proof here they were interrupted by a flourish oftrumpets his grace of albany is unwontedly scrupuloustoday said douglas but it skillsnot wasting words the time is past these aremarch's trumpets and i warrant me he ridesat flight speed so soon as he passes the southport we shall hear of him in time and if itbe as i have conjectured he shall be met withthough all england backed his treacherynay let us hope better of the noble earlof march said the king no way displeasedthat the quarrel betwixt march and douglashad seemed to obliterate the traces of the disagreementbetwixt rothsay and his fatherinlaw he hath a fiery but not a sullen temperin some things he has been i will not saywronged but disappointed and something isto be allowed to the resentment of high bloodarmed with great power but thank heaven allof us who remain are of one sentiment and ofone house so that at least our councils cannotnow be thwarted with disunion father priori pray you take your writing materials for youmust as usual be our clerk of council andnow to business my lords and our first objectof consideration must be this highlandcumberbetween the clan chateau and the clanquhele or kay said the prior which asour last advices from our brethren at duckedinform us is ready to break out into a more formidablewarfare than has yet taken place betweenthese sons of belial who speak of nolithing else than of utterly destroying one anothertheir forces are assembling on eachside and not a man claiming in the tenth degreeof kindred but must repair to the brateach of his tribe or stand to the punishmentof fire and sword the fiery cross hath fled likea meteor in every direction and awakenedstrange and unknown tribes beyond the distantmurray firth may heaven and st dominic beour protection but if your lordships cannotfind remedy for evil it will spread broad andwide and the patrimony of the church mustin every direction be exposed to the fury ofthese amalekite with whom there is as littledevotion to heaven as there is pity or love totheir neighbours may our lady be our guard we hear some of them are yet utter heathensand worship mahound and termagant my lords and kinsmen said robert ye have heard the urgency of this case and maystandard literally cloth the lowland language stillretains the word irate which however is only applicable to achild's pinafore or a coarse towel to such mean offices ninewords descenddesire to know my sentiments before you deliverwhat your own wisdom shall suggest and insooth no better remedy occurs to me than tosend two commissioners with full power fromus to settle such debates as be among them and at the same time to charge them as theyshall be answerable to the law to lay down theirarms and forbear all practices of violence againsteach otheri approve of your grace's proposal saidrothsay and i trust the good prior will notrefuse the venerable station of envoy upon thispeacemaking errand and his reverend brotherthe abbot of the carthusian convent mustcontend for an honour which will certainly addtwo most eminent recruits to the large army ofmartyrs since the highlanders little regard thedistinction betwixt clerk and layman in theambassadors whom you send to themmy royal lord of rothsay said the priorif i am destined to the blessed crown of martjadom i shall be doubtless directed to the pathy which i am tn attain it meantime if youvot it rspeak in jest may heaven pardon you and giveyou light to perceive that it were better buckleon your arms to guard the possessions of thechurch so perilously endangered than to employyour wit in taunting her ministers andservantsi taunt no one father prior said theyouth yawning nor have i much objectionto taking arms excepting that they are a somewhatcumbrous garb and in february a furredmantle is more suiting the weather than asteel corslet and it irks me the more to puton cold harness in this nipping weather thatwould but the church send a detachment oftheir saints and they have some highlandones well known in this district and doubtlessused to the climate they might fight theirown battles like merry st george of englandbut i know not how it is we hear of theirmiracles when they are propitiated and of theirvengeance if any one trespasses on their patrimoniesand these are urged as reasons for extendingtheir lands by large largesses and yetif there come down but a band of twenty highlandersbell book and candle make no speedand the belted baron must be fain to maintainthe church in possession of the lands which hehas given to her as much as if he himself stillenjoyed the fruits of themson robert said his father jou givean undue license to your tonguenay sir i am mute replied the princei had no purpose to disturb your highnessor displease the father prior who with somany miracles at his disposal will not face asit seems a handful of highland catherinewe know said the prior with suppressedindignation from what source these viledoctrines are derived which we hear with horrorfrom the tongue of your highness whenprinces converse with heretics their minds andmanners are alike corrupted they show themselvesin the streets as the companions of mastersand harlots and in the council as the scornersof the church and of holy thingspeace good father said the king rothsav shall make amends for what he hasidly spoken alas let us take counsel in friendlyfashion rather than resemble a mutinouscrew of mariners in a sinking vessel wheneach is more intent on quarrelling with hisneighbours than in assisting the exertions ofthe forlorn master for the safety of the ship my lord of douglas your house has been seldomto lack when the crown of scotland desiredeither wise counsel or manly achievement i trust you will help us in this strait i can only wonder that the strait shouldexist my lord answered the haughty douglas when i was intrusted with the lieutenancyof the kingdom there were some ofthese wild clans came down from the grampiani troubled not the council about thematter but made the sheriff lord ruthvenget to horse with the forces of the carse thehays the lindsay the oxides and othergentlemen by st bride when it was steelcoat to frieze mantle the thieves knew whatlances were good for and whether swords hadedges or no there were some three hundredof their best bonnets besides that of their chiefdonald cognac left on the moor of thornand in rochinroy wood j and as many weregibbeted at ploughman stairs which has stillthe name from the hangman work that was donthere this is the way men deal with thievesin my country and if gentler methods will succeedbetter with these parish knaves do notblame douglas for speaking his mind yousmile my lord of rothsay may i ask how ihave a seconc time become your jest before ihave replied to the first which you passed onme nay be not wrathful my good lord ofdouglas answered the prince i did butsmile to think how your princely retinue woulddwindle if every thief were dealt with as thepoor highlanders at ploughman stairsthe king again interfered to prevent the earlfrom giving an angry reply your lordshipsaid he to douglas advises wisely that weshould trust to arms when these men come outagainst our subjects on the fair and level plain some authorities place this skirmish so late as but the difficulty is to put a stop to their disorderswhile they continue to lurk within theirmountains i need not tell you that the clanciiattan and the clan kay are great confederaciesconsisting each of various tribes who arcbanded together each to support their own separateleague and who of late have had dissensionswhich have drawn blood wherever theyhave met whether individually or in bandsthe whole country is torn to pieces by theirrestless feudsi cannot see the evil of this said thedouglas the ruffians will destroy each otherand the deer of the highlands will increase asthe men diminish we shall gain as huntersthe exercise we lose as warriorsrather say that the wolves will increase asthe men diminish replied the kingi am content said douglas betterwild wolves than wild highlanders let therebe strong forces maintained along the highlandfrontier to separate the quiet from the disturbedcountry confine the fire of civil war withinthe highlands let it spend its uncontrolledfury and it will be soon burnt out for want offuel the survivors will be humbled and willbe more obedient to a whisper of your grace'spleasure than their fathers or the knaves thatnow exist have been to your strictest commandsthis is wise but ungodly counsel said theprior shaking his head i cannot take it uponmy conscience to recommend it it is wisdombut it is the wisdom of achitophel crafty atonce and cruelmy heart tells me so said robert layinghis hand on his breast my heart tells methat it will be asked of me at the awful dayrobert stewart where are the subjects i havegiven thee it tells me that i must account forthem all saxon and gael lowland highlandand border man that i will not be required toanswer for those alone who have wealth andknowledge but for those also who were robbersbecause they were poor and rebels because theywere ignorantyou highness speaks like a christianking said the prior but you bear thesword his well as the sceptre and this presentevil is of a kind which the sword must cure hark ye my lords said the princelooking up as if a gay thought had suddenlystruck him suppose we teach these savagemountaineers a strain of chivalry it were nohard matter to bring these two great commandersthe captain of the clan chateau andthe chief of the no less doughty race of theclan quhele to defy each other to mortal combatthey might fight here in perth wewould lend them horse and armour thus theirfend would be stanched by the death of one orprobably both of the villains for i think bothavould break their necks in the first chargemy father's godly desire of saving blood wouldbe attained and we should have the pleasureof seeing such a combat between two salvageknights for the first time in their lives wearingbreeches and mounted on horses as hasnot been heard of since the days of king shame upon yon son robert said thekiig do you make the distress of your butimecountry and the perplexity of our councilsa subject for buffoonery if you will pardon me royal brother saidalbany i think that though my princelynephew hath started this thought in a jocularmanner there may be something wrought outof it which might greatly remedy this pressingevilgood brother replied the king it isunkind to expose rothsay's folly by pressingfurther his illtimed jest we know the highlandclans have not our customs of chivalrynor the habit or mode of doing battle which theserequiretrue royal brother answered albany yet i speak not in scorn but in serious earnesttrue the mountaineers have not our forms andmode of doing battle in the lists but they havethose which are as effectual to the destruction ofhuman life and so that the mortal game is playedand the stake won and lost what signifies itwhether these gael fight with sword and lanceas becomes belted knights or with sandbagslike the restless churls of england or butchereach other with knives and skeans in their ownbarbarous fashion their habits like our ownrefer all disputed rights and claims to the decisionof battle they are as vain too as theyare fierce and the idea that these two clanswould be admitted to combat in presence of yourgrace and of your court will readily inducethem to refer their difference to the fate of battleeven were such rough arbitrement less familiarto their customs and that in any suchnumbers as shall be thought most convenientwe must take care that they approach not thecourt save in such a fashion and number thatthey shall not be able to surprise us and thatpoint being provided against the more that shallbe admitted to combat upon either side thegreater will be the slaughter among their bravestand most stirring men and the more thechance of the highlands being quiet for sometimeto comethis were a bloody policy brother saidthe king and again i say that i cannot bringmy conscience to countenance the slaughter ofthese rude men that are so little better than somany benighted heathens and are their lives more precious askedalbany than those of nobles and gentlemenwho by your grace's license are so frequentlyadmitted to fight in barrack either for the satisfyingof disputes at law or simply to acquirehonour the king thus hard pressed had little to sayagainst a custom so engrafted upon the laws ofthe realm and the usages of chivalry as the trialby combat and he only replied god knowsi have never granted such license as you urgewe with unless with the greatest repugnance and that i never saw men have strife togetherto the effusion of blood but i could have wishedto appease it with the shedding of myownbut my gracious lord said the prior itseems that if we follow not some such policy asthis of my lord of albany we must have recourseto that of the douglas and at the riskof the dubious event of battle and with thecertainty of losing many excellent subjects doby means of the lowland swords that whichthese wild mountaineers will otherwise performwith their owu hand what says my lord ofdouglas to the policy of his grace of albany douglas said the haughty lord nevercounselled that to be done by policy whichmight be attained by open force he remainsby his opinion and is willing to march at thehead of his own followers with those of thebarons of perthshire and the carse and eitherbring these highlanders to reason or subjectionor leave the body of a douglas among their savagewildernessesit is nobly said my lord of douglas saidalbany and well might the king rely uponthy undaunted heart and the courage of thyresolute followers but see you not how soonyou may be called elsewhere where your presenceand services are altogether indispensableto scotland and her monarch marked younot the gloomy tone in which the fiery earl ofmarch limited his allegiance and faith to oursovereign here present to that space for whichhe was to remain king robert's vassal anddid not you yourself suspect that he was plottinga transference of his allegiance to england other chiefs of subordinate power andinferior fame may do battle with the highlanders but if march admit the perches andtheir englishmen into our frontiers who willdrive them back if the douglas be elsewhere my sword answered douglas is equallyat the service of his majesty on the frontieror in the deepest recesses of the highlandsi have seen the backs of the proud percy andgeorge dunbar ere now and i may see themagain and if it is the king's pleasure i shouldtake measures against this probable conjunctionof stranger and traitor i admit that rather thantrust to an inferior or feebler hand the importanttask of settling the highlands i would be disposedto give my opinion in favour of the policyof my lord of albany and suffer those savagesto carve each other's limbs without givingbarons and knights the trouble of huntingthem downmy lord of douglas said the princewho seemed determined to omit no opportunityto gall his haughty fatherinlaw does notchoose to leave to us lowlanders even the poorcrumbs of honour which might be gathered atthe expense of the highland kerne while hewith his border chivalry reaps the full harvestof victory over the english but percy hathseen men's backs as well as douglas and ihave known as great wonders as that he whogoes forth to seek such wool should come backshorna phrase said douglas well becominga prince who speaks of honour with a wanderingharlot's scrip in his bonnet by way of favourexcuse it my lord said rothsay menwho have fetched unwittingly become carelessin the choice of those whom they love paramours the chained dog must snatch at thenearest bonerothsay my unhappy son exclaimed theking art thou mad or wouldst thou drawdown on thee the full storm of a king and father'sdispleasure i am dumb returned the prince at yourgrace's command well then my lord of albany said theking since such is your advice and sincescottish blood must flow how i pray you arewe to prevail on these fierce men to refer theirquarrel to such a combat as you propose that my liege said albany your words seem to aim at some one in thispresence father prior said the douglas ifat me they do me foul wrong i am well awarethat the abbot of aberbrothick hath madesome illadvised complaints that i suffered nothis beeves to become too many for his pasturesor his stock of grain to burst the girlsof the monastery while my followers lackedbeef and their horses corn but bethink youthe pastures and cornfields which produced thatplenty were bestowed by my ancestors on thehouse of aberbrothick surely not with the purposethat their descendant should starve in themidst of it and neither will he by st bride but for heresy and false doctrine he addedstriking his large hand heavily on the counciltable who is it that dare tax the douglas iwould not have poor men burned for sillythoughts but my hand and sword are ever readyto maintain the christian faithmy lord i doubt it not said the prior sohath il ever been with your most noble housemfot the ablots complaints they may pass toa second day but what we now desire is acommission to some noble lord of state joinedto others of holy church to support by strengthof hand if necessary the inquiries which thereverend official of the bounds and other graveprelates my unworthy self being one are aboutto make into the cause of the new doctrineswhich are now deluding the simple and depravingthe pure and precious faith approvedby the holy father and his reverend predecessors let the earl of douglas have a royal commissionto this effect said albany and letthere be no exception whatever from his jurisdictionsaving the royal person for my ownpart although conscious that i have neither inact nor thought received or encouraged a doctrinewhich holy church hath not sanctionedyet i should blush to claim an immunity underthe blood royal of scotland lest i should seemto be seeking refuge against a crime so horriblei will have nought to do with it saiddouglas to march against the english andthe southron traitor march is task enough formemoreover i am a true scotsman andwill not give way to aught that may put thechurch of scotland's head farther into the romanyoke or make the barons coronet stoop tothe mitre and cowl do thou therefore mostnoble duke of albany place your own namein the commission and i pray your grace soto mitigate the zeal of the men of holy churchwho may be associated with you that there beno over zealous dealings for the smell of afaggot on the tay would bring back the douglasfrom the walls of yorkthe duke hastened to give the earl assurancethat the commission should be exercised withlenity and moderationff without a question said king robertthe commission must be ample and did itconsist with the dignity of our crown we wouldnot ourselves decline its jurisdiction but wetrust that while the thunders of the churchare directed against the vile authors of thesedetestable heresies there shall bs measures ofmildness and compassion taken with the unfortunatevictims of their delusions riajnoci msuch is ever the course of holy churchmy lord said the prior of st dominic's why then let the commission be

chapter iia former chapter opened in the royal confessional we are now to introduce our readersto a situation somewhat similar though thescene and persons were very different insteadof a gothic and darkened apartment in a monasteryone of the most beautiful prospects inscotland lay extended beneath the hill of kinsouland at the foot of a rock which commandedthe view in every direction sat thefair maid of perth listening in an attitude ofdevout attention to the instructions of a carthusianmonk in his white gown and scapularwho concluded his discourse with prayerin which his proselyte devoutly joinedwhen they had finished their devotions thepriest sat for some time with his eyes fixed onthe glorious prospect of which even the earlyand chilly season could not conceal the beautiesand it was some time ere he addressed hisattentive companionwhen i behold he said at length thisrich and varied land with its castles churchesconvents stately palaces and fertile fields theseextensive woods and that noble river i knownot my daughter whether most to admire thebounty of god or the ingratitude of man hehath given us the beauty and fertility of theearth and we have made the scene of his bountya charnelhouse and a battlefield he hathgiven us power over the elements and skill toerect houses for comfort and defence and wehave converted them into dens for robbers andruffiansyet surely my father there is room forcomfort replied catharine even in the veryprospect we look upon yonder four goodlyconvents with their churches and their towerswhich tell the citizens with brazen voice thatthey should think on their religious duties their inhabitants who have separated themselvesfrom the world its pursuits and its pleasuresto dedicate themselves to the service ofheaven all bear witness that if scotland beabloody and a sinful land she is yet alive andsensible to the claims which religion demandsof the human raceverily daughter what you say seems truth and yet nearly viewed too much of the comfortyou describe will be found delusive it is truethere was a period in the christian world whengood men maintaining themselves by the workof their hands assembled together not thatthey might live easily or sleep softly but thatthey might strengthen each other in the christianfaith and qualify themselves to be teachersof the word to the people doubtless thereare still such to be found in the holy edifices onwhich we now look but it is to be fearedthat the love of many has waxed cold ourchurchmen have become wealthy as well bythe gifts of pious persons as by the bribeswhich wicked men have given in their ignoranceimagining that they can purchase thatpardon for endowments to the church whichheaven has only offered to sincere penitentsand thus as the church waxeth rich her doc itrines have unhappily become dim and obscureas a light is less seen if placed in a lamp ofchased gold than beheld through a screen ofglass god knows if i see these things andmark them it is from no wish of singularity ordesire to make myself a teacher in israel butbecause the fire burns in my bosom and willnot permit me to be silent i obey the rules ofmy order and withdraw not myself from itsausterities be they essential to our salvationor be they mere formalities adopted to supplythe want of real penitence and sincere devotioni have promised nay vowed to observe them and they shall be respected by me the morethat otherwise i might be charged with regardingmy bodily ease when heaven is my witnesshow lightly i value what i may be called on tovolet dact or suffer if the purity of the church couldbe restored or the discipline of the priesthoodreplaced in its primitive simplicitybut my father said catharine evenfor these opinions men term you a lollard anda wickliffe and say it is your desire to destroychurches and cloisters and restore thereligion of heathenismeven so my daughter am i driven to seekrefuge in hills and rocks and must be presentlycontented to take my flight amongst therude highlanders who are thus far in a moregracious state than those i leave behind methat theirs are crimes of ignorance not ofpresumption i will not omit to take suchmeans of safety and escape from their crueltyas heaven may open to me for while such appeari shall account it a sign that i have stilla service to accomplish but when it is mymaster's pleasure he knows how willinglyclement blair will lay down a vilified life uponearth in humble hope of a blessed exchangehereafter but wherefore dost thou look northwardso anxiously my child thy young eyesare quicker than mine dost thou see any onecoming i look father for the highland youth conacharwho will be thy guide to the hills wherehis father can afford thee a safe if a rude retreatthis he has often promised when wespoke of you and of your lessons i fear he isnow in company where he will soon forgetthem the youth hath sparkles of grace in himsaid father clement although those of hisrace are usually too much devoted to their ownfierce and savage customs to endure with patienceeither the restraints of religion or thoseof the social law thou hast never told medaughter how contrary to all the usages eitherof the burgh or of the mountains this youthcame to reside in thy father's house all i know touching that matter saidcatharine is that his father is a man of consequenceamong those hill men and that he desiredas a favour of my father who hath hadwwivrsry ofdealings with them in the way of his merchandiseto keep this youth for a certain time andthat two days since they parted as he was toreturn home to his own mountainsand why has my daughter demanded thepriest maintained such a correspondence withthis highland youth that she should know howto send for him when she desired to use hisservices in my behalf surely this is muchinfluence for a maiden to possess over sucha wild colt as this youthful mountaineercatharine blushed and answered with hesitation if i have had any influence with conchaheaven be my witness i have only exertedit to enforce upon his fiery temper compliancewith the rules of civil life it is true i havelong expected that you my father would beobliged to take to flight and i therefore hadagreed with him that he should meet me at thisplace as soon as he should receive a messagefrom me with a token which i yesterday dispatchedthe messenger was a lightfootedboy of his own clan whom he used sometimesto send on errands into the highlandsand am i then to understand daughterthat this youth so fair to the eye was nothingmore dear to you than as you desired to enlightenhis mind and reform his manners it is so my father and no otherwise answeredcatharine and perhaps i did not dowell to hold intimacy with him even for hisinstruction and improvement but my discoursenever led fartherthen have i been mistaken my daughter for i thought i had seen in thee of late somechange of purpose and some wishful regardslooking back to this world of which you wereat one time resolved to take leavecatharine hung down her head and blushedmore deeply than ever as she said yourselffather were used to remonstrate againstmy taking the veilnor do i now approve of it my child saidthe priest marriage is an honourable stateappointed by heaven as the regular means ofcontinuing the race of man and i read not in thescriptures what human inventions have sinceaffirmed concerning the superior excellence ofa state of celibacy but i am jealous of theemy child as a father is of his only daughter lestthou shouldst throw thyself away upon someoneunworthy of thee thy parent i know lessnice in thy behalf than i am countenances theaddresses of that fierce and riotous revellerwhom they call henry of the wynd he isrich it may be but a haunter of idle and debauchedcompany a common prizefighterwho has shed human blood like water cansuch a one be a fit mate for catharine glover and yet report says they are soon to beunitedthe fair maid of perth's complexion changedfrom red to pale and from pale to red as shehastily replied i think not of him thoughit is true some courtesies have passed betwixtus of late both as he is my father's friend andas being according to the custom of the timemy valentineyour valentine my child said fatherclement and can your modesty and prudencehave trifled so much with the delicacy ofyour sex as to place yourself in such a relationto such a man as this artificer think youthat this valentine a godly saint and christianbishop as he is said to have been ever countenanceda silly and unseemly custom more likelyto have originated in the heathen worship offlora or venus when mortals gave the namesof deities to their passions and studied to exciteinstead of restraining them father said catharine in a tone of moredispleasure than she had ever before assumedto the carthusian i know not upon whatground you tax me thus severely for complyingwith a general practice authorized by universalcustom and sanctioned by my father's authorityi cannot feel it kind that you put suchmisconstruction upon meforgive me daughter answered the priestmildly if i have given you offence but thishenry smith is a forward licentious man towhom you cannot allow any uncommon degreeof intimacy and encouragement without exposingyourself to worse misconstruction unlessindeed it be your purpose to wed him andthat very shortly say no more of it my father said catharine you give me more pain than you woulddesire to do and i may be provoked to answerotherwise than as becomes me perhaps i havealready had cause enough to make me repent mycompliance with an idle custom at any ratebelieve that henry smith is nothing to me andthat even the idle intercourse arising from stvalentine's day is utterly broken off i am rejoiced to hear it my daughter repliedthe carthusian and must now proveyou on another subject which renders me mostanxious on your behalf you cannot yourself beignorant of it although i could wish it were notnecessary to speak of a thing so dangerous evenbefore these surrounding rocks cliffs andstones but it must be said catharine youhave a lover in the highest rank of scotland'ssons of honour i know it father answered catharinecomposedly i would it were not soso would i also said the priest did isee in my daughter only the child of follywhich most young women are at her age especiallyif possessed of the fatal gift of beautybut as thy charms to speak the language of anidle world have attached to thee a lover of suchhigh rank so i know that thy virtue and wisdomwill maintain the influence over the prince'smind which thy beauty hath acquiredfather replied catharine the prince isa licentious gallant whose notice of me tendsonly to my disgrace and ruin can you whoseemed but now afraid that i acted imprudentlyin entering into an ordinary exchange of courtesieswith one of my own rank speak with patienceof the sort of correspondence which theheir of scotland dares to fix upon me knowthat it is but two nights since he with a partyof his debauched followers would have carriedme by force from my father's house had i notbeen rescued by that same rash spirited henrysmith who if he be too hasty in venturing ondanger on slight occasion is always ready toventure his life in behalf of innocence or in resistanceof oppression it is well my part to dohim that justice i should know something of that mattersaid the monk since it was my voice that senthim to your assistance i had seen the party asi passed your door and was hastening to thecivil power in order to raise assistance when iperceived a man's figure coming slowly towardsme apprehensive it might he one of the ambuscadei stepped behind the buttresses of thechapel of st john and seeing from a nearerview that it was henry smith i guessedwhich way he was bound and raised my voicein an exhortation which made him double hisspeedi am beholden to you father said catharine but all this and the duke of rothsay'sown language to me only show that the princeis a profligate young man who will scruple noextremities which may promise to gratify an idlepassion at whatever expense to its object hisemissary ramorny has even had the insolenceto tell me that my father shall suffer for it if idare to prefer being the wife of an honest manto becoming the loose paramour of a marriedprince so t see no other remedy than to takethe veil or run the risk of my own ruin andmy poor father's were there no other reasonthe terror of these threats from a man so notoriouslycapable of keeping his word ought asmuch to prevent my becoming the bride of anyworthy man as it should prohibit me from unlatchinghis door to admit murderers ohgood father what a lot is mine and howfatal am i likely to prove to my affectionate parentand to any one with whom i might allymy unhappy fortunes be yet of good cheer my daughter saidthe monk there is comfort for thee even inthis extremity of apparent distress ramorny isa villain and abuses the ear of his patron theprince is unhappily a dissipated and idle youth but unless my grey hairs have been strangelyimposed on his character is beginning to alterhe hath been awakened to ramorny's basenessand deeply regrets having followed his eviladvice i believe nay i am well convincedthat his passion for you has assumed a noblerand purer character and that the lessons he hasheard from me on the corruptions of the churchand of the times will if enforced from yourlips sink deeply into his heart and perhapsproduce fruits for the world to wonder aswell as rejoice at old prophecies have saidthat rome shall fall by the speech of a womanthese are dreams father said catharine the visions of one whose thoughts aretoo much on better things to admit his thinkingjustly upon the ordinary affairs of earthwhen we have looked long at the sun everythingelse can only be seen indistinctlythou art over hasty my daughter saidclement and thou shalt be convinced of itthe prospects which i am to open to thee wereunfit to be exposed to one of a less firm senseof virtue or a more ambitious temper perhapsit is not fit that even to you i shoulddisplay them but my confidence is strong in thywisdom and thy principles know then thatthere is much chance that the church of romewill dissolve the union which she has herselfformed and release the duke of rothsay fromhis marriage with marjory douglashere he pausedand if the church hath power and will todothis replied the maiden what influencecan the divorce of the duke from his wife produceon the fortunes of catharine glover she looked at the priest anxiously as shespoke and he had some apparent difficulty inframing his reply for he looked on the groundwhile he answered herwhat did beauty do for catharine logic unless our fathers told us falsely it raised herto share the throne of david brucedid she live happy or die regretted goodfather asked catharine in the same calmand steady toneshe formed her alliance from temporaland perhaps criminal ambition replied fatherclement and she found her reward in vanityand vexation of spirit but had she weddedwith the purpose that the believing wife shouldconvert the unbelieving or confirm the doubtinghusband what then had been her rewardlove and honour upon earth and aninheritance in heaven with queen margaretand those heroines who have been the nursingmothers of the churchhitherto catharine had sat upon a stone besidethe priest's feet and looked up to him asshe spoke or listened but now as if animatedby calm yet settled feelings of disapprobationshe rose up and extending her hand towardsthe monk as she spoke addressed him witha countenance and voice which might have becomea cherub pitying and even as much aspossible sparing the feelings of the mortalwhose errors he is commissioned to rebukeand is it even so she said and cansomuch of the wishes hopes and prejudices ofthis vile world affect him who may be calledtomorrow to lay down his life for opposing thecorruptions of a wicked age and backslidingpriesthood can it be the severely virtuousfather clement who advises his child to aimat or even to think of the possession of athrone and a bed which cannot become vacantbut by an act of crying injustice to the presentpossessor can it be the wise reformer of theschurch who wishes to rest a scheme in itself sounjust upon a foundation so precarious sincewhen is it good father that the principallibertine has altered his morals so much to belikely to court in honourable fashion the daughterof a perth artizan two days must havewrought this change for only that space haspassed since he was breaking into my father'shouse at midnight with worse mischief in hismind than that of a common robber and thinkyou that if rothsay's heart could dictate somean a match he could achieve such a purposewithout endangering both his succession andhis life assailed by the douglas and march atthe same time for what they must receive asan act of injury and insult to both their houses oh father clement where was your principlewhere your prudence when they suffered youto be bewildered by so strange a dream andplaced the meanest of your disciples in theright thus to reproach you the old man's eyes filled with tears as catharinevisibly and painfully affected by whatshe had said was at length silentby the mouths of babes and sucklingshe said hath he rebuked those who wouldseem wise in their generation i thank heaventhat hath taught me better thoughts thanmy own vanity suggested through the mediumof so kind a monitress yes catharine i mustnot hereafter wonder or exclaim when i seethose whom i have hitherto judged too harshlystruggling for temporal power and holdingall the while the language of religious zeal ithank thee daughter for thy salutary admonitionand i thank heaven that sent it by thylips rather than those of a sterner reprovercatharine had raised her head to reply andbid the old man whose humiliation gave herpain be comforted when her eyes were arrestedby an object close at hand among the cragsand cliffs which surrounded this place of seclusionthere were two which stood in such closecontiguity that they seemed to have been portionsof the same rock which rended by lightningor by an earthquake now exhibited achasm of about four feet in breadth betwixtthe masses of stone into this chasm an oaktree had thrust itself in one of the fantasticfrolics which vegetation often exhibits in suchsituations the tree stunted and illfed hadsent its roots along the face of the rock in alldirections to seek for supplies and they laylike military lines of communication contortedtwisted and knotted like the immensesnakes of the indian archipelago as catharine'slook fell upon the curious complicationof knotty branches and twisted roots she wassuddenly sensible that two large eyes were visibleamong them fixed and glaring at her likethose of a wild animal in ambush she startedand without speaking pointed out the objectto her companion and looking herself withmore strict attention could at length trace outthe bushy red hair and shaggy beard whichhad hitherto been concealed by the droopingbranches and contorted roots of the treewhen he saw himself discovered the highlanderfor such he proved stepped forth fromhis lurkingplace and stalking forward disvolii emplayed a colossal person clothed in a purple redand greenchecked plaid under which he worea jacket of bull's hide his bow and arrows wereat his back his head was bare and a large quantityof tangled locks like the gibbs of the irishserved to cover the head and supplied all thepurposes of a bonnet his belt bore a swordand dagger and he had in his hand a danishpoleaxe more recently called a lochaber axethrough the same rude portal advanced oneby one four men more of similar size anddressed and armed in the same mannercatharine was too much accustomed to theappearance of the inhabitants of the mountainsso near to perth to permit herself to be alarmedas another lowland maiden might have beenon the same occasion she saw with tolerablecomposure these gigantic forms arrange themselvesin a semicircle around and in front of themonk and herself all bending upon them insilence their large fixed eyes expressing as faras she could judge a wild admiration of herbeauty she inclined her head to them and utteredimperfectly the usual words of a highlandsalutation the elder and leader of the partyreturned the greeting and then again remainedsilent and motionless the monk told his beads and even catharine began to have strange fearsfor her personal safety and anxiety to know whetherthey were to consider themselves at personalfreedom she resolved to make the experimentand moved forward as if to descend thehill but when she attempted to pass the line ofhighlanders they extended their poleaxes betwixteach other so as effectually to occupy eachopening through which she could have passedsomewhat disconcerted yet not dismayedfor she could not conceive that any evil was intendedshe sat down upon one of the scatteredfragments of rock and bade the monk standingby her side be of good courageif i fear said father clement it is notfor myself for whether i be brained with theaxes of these wild men like an ox when wornout by labour he is condemned to the slaughteror whether i am bound with their bowstringsand delivered over to lliose who will take mylife with more cruel ceremony it can but littleconcern me if they suffer thee dearest daughterto escape uninjuredwe have neither of us replied the maidenof perth any cause for apprehending evil and here comes conachar to assure us of ityet as she spoke she almost doubted her owneyes so altered were the manner and attire ofthe handsome stately and almost splendidlydressed youth who springing like a roebuckfrom a cliff of considerable height lighted justinfront of her his dress was of the same tartanworn by those who had first made their appearancebut closed at the throat and elbows witha necklace and armlets of gold the hauberkwhich he wore over his person was of steelbut so clearly burnished that it shone like silverhis arms were profusely ornamented andhis bonnet besides the eagle's feather markingthe quality of chief was ornamented with achain of gold wrapt several times around itand secured by a large clasp adorned withpearls his brooch by which the tartan mantleor plaid as it is now called was secured on theshoulder was also of gold large and curiouslycarved he bore no weapon in his hand exceptinga small sapling stick with a hookedhead his whole appearance and gait whichused formerly to denote a sullen feeling of consciousdegradation was now bold forward andhaughty and he stood before catharine withsmiling confidence as if fully conscious of hisimproved appearance and waiting till she shouldrecognise himconachar said catharine desirous tobreak this state of suspense are these yourfather's men no fair catharine answered the youngman conachar is no more unless in regardto the wrongs he has sustained and the vengeancewhich they demand i am ian machinmaclan son to the chief of the clan quhelei have mounted my feathers as you see

bodyguard and the childrenof my belt who breathe but to do my willbut conachar he added in a softer tone ofvoice lives again so soon as catharine desiresto see him and while he is the young chief ofthe clan quhele to all others he is to her ashumble and obedient as when he was simonglover's apprentice see here is the stick ihad from you when we nutted together in thesunny braes of enoch when autumn wasyoung in the year that is gone i would notpart with it catharine for the truncheon of mytribewhile euclid thus spoke catharine beganto doubt in her own mind whether she had actedprudently in requesting the assistance of a boldyoung man elated doubtless by his suddenelevation from a state of servitude to one whichshe was aware gave him extensive authorityover a very lawless body of adherents you do not fear me fair catharine saidthe young chief taking her hand i sufferedmy people to appear before me for a few minutesthat i miffht see how you could cnduie theirpresence iiud methiiikti you regarded them asif you were born to be a chieftain's wifei have no reason to fear wrong from highlanderssaid catharine firmly especially as thought conachar was with them conacharhas drunk of our cup and eaten of our bread and my father has often had traffic with highlandersand never was there wrong or quarrelbetwixt him and themno replied hector for such is the saxonequivalent for eachin what never whenhe took the part of the gow chron the smith against eachin maclan say nothing to excuse it and believe it willbe your own fault if i ever again allude to itbut you had some command to lay upon me speak and you shall be obeyedcatharine hastened to reply for there wassomething in the young chief's manner andlanguage which made her desire to shortenthe intervieweachin she said since conachar is nohunger your name you ought to be sensiblethat in claiming as i honestly might a servicefrom my equal i little thought that was addressinga person of such superior power

the town ofperth persecute one who hath taken hold ofmaclan's mantle it may not be safe to trust too much tothat said catharine i nothing doubt thepower of your tribe but when the black douglastakes

whose actions were only directedby the will of their chief and whose chiefwas a giddy and impetuous boy she apprehendedno insult on her return to perth fromthe soldiery of any party whom she might

king wereequally unnatural and impolitic why shrink from that man when thy wholescheme answered the prince in stern displeasure is one lesson of unnatural guilt mixedwith shortsighted ambition if the

advicewill bring him to life againno henry no he is slain slain with abattleaxe or some such weaponimpossible replied the smith he waslightfooted enough and would not for alliperth have trusted to his hands when he couldextricate himself by his heelsno choice was allowed him the blow wasdealt in the very back of his head he whostruck must have been a shorter man than himselfand used a horseman's battleaxe or somesuch weapon for a lochaberaxe must havestruck the upper part of his head but therehe lies dead brained i may say by a most frightfulwoundthis is inconceivable said henry wyndhe was in my house at midnight in a morriver'shabit seemed to have been drinkingthough not to excess he told me a tale of havingbeen beset by revellers and being in danger but alas you know the man i deemedit was a swaggering fit as he sometimes tookwhen he was in liquor and may the mercifulvirgin forgive me i let him go without companyin which i did him inhuman wrong holyst john be my witness i would have gone withany helpless creature and far more with himwith whom i have so often sat at the same boardand drunken of the same cup who of the raceof man could have thought of harming a creature simple and so unoffending excepting byhis idle vaunts henry he wore thy headpiece thy buffcoatthy target how came he by these why he demanded the use of them for thenight and i was ill at ease and well pleasedto be rid of his company having kept no holidayand being determined to keep none in respectof our misunderstandingit is the opinion of bailie craigdallie andall our sagest councillors that the blow wasintended for yourself and that it becomes youto prosecute the due vengeance of our fellowcitizenwho received the death which was meantfor youthe smith was for some time silent theyhad now left the garden and were walking in alonely lane by which they meant to approachthe councilhouse of the burgh without beingexposed to observation or idle inquiryyou are silent my son yet we two havemuch to speak of said simon glover bethinkthee that this widowed woman maudlinif she should see cause to bring a charge againstany one for the wrong done to her and her orphanchildren must support it by a championaccording to law and custom for be the murdererwho he may we know enough of thesefollowers of the nobles to be assured that theparty suspected will appeal to the combat inderision perhaps of those whom they will callthe cowardly burghers while we are men withblood in our veins this must not be henrywyndi see where you would draw me fatheranswered henry dejectedly and st johnknows i have heard a summons to battle aswillingly as warhorse ever heard the trumpetbut bethink you father how i have lostcatharine's favour repeatedly and have beendriven well nigh to despair of ever regainingit for being if i may say so even too ready aman of my hands and here are all our quarrelsmade up and the hopes that seemed thismorning removed beyond earthly prospect havebecome nearer and brighter than ever andmust i with the dear one's kiss of forgivenesson my lips engage in a new scene of violencewhich you are well aware will give her thedeepest offence it is hard for me to advise you henrysaid simon but this i must ask you haveyou or have you not reason to think that thispoor unfortunate oliver has been mistaken foryoui fear it too much said henry he wasthought something like me and the poor foolhad studied to ape my gestures and manner ofwalking nay the very airs which i have thetrick of whistling that he might increase a resemblancewhich has cost him dear i have illwillersenough both in burgh and landward toowe me a shrewd turn and he i think couldhave none such well henry i cannot say but my daughterwill be offended she has been much withfather clement and has received notions aboutpeace and forgiveness which methinks suit illwith a country where the laws cannot protectus unless we have spirit to protect ourselvesif you determine for the combat i will do mybest to persuade her to look ou the matter asthe other good womanhood in the burgh willdo and if you resolve to let the matter rest the man who has lost his life for yours remainingunavenged the widow and the orphanswithout any reparation for the loss of a husbandand father i will then do you the justice toremember that i at least ought not to thinkthe worse of you for your patience since it wasadopted for love of my child but henry wemust in that case remove ourselves from bonnyst johnstoun for here we will be but a disgracedfamilyhenry groaned deeply and was silent for aninstant then replied i would rather be deadthan dishonoured though i should never see heragain had it been yester evening i wouldhave met the best blade among these menatarmsas blithely as ever i danced at a maypolebut today when she had first as good as saidhenry smith i love thee father gloverit is very hard yet it is all my own fault i ought to have allowed him the shelter of myroof lion lie prayed me in his agony of fear or had i gone with lii i should then haveprevented or shared his fate but i tauntedhim ridiculed him loaded him with maledictionsthough the saints know they were utteredin idle peevishness of impatience i drovehim out from my doors whom i knew so helplessto take the fate which was perhaps intendedfor me i must avenge him or be dishonouredfor ever see father i have beencalled a man hard as the steel i work in doesburnished steel ever drop tears like these shame on me that i should shed them it is no shame my dearest son said simon thou art as kind as brave and i have alwaysknown it there is yet a chance for us noone may be discovered to whom suspicion attachesand where none such is found the combatcannot take place it is a hard thing towish that the innocent blood may not be avengedbut if the perpetrator of this foul murderbe hidden for the present thou wilt be savedfrom the task of seeking that vengeance whichheaven doubtless will take at its own propertimeas they spoke thus they arrived at the pointof the high street where the councilhouse wassituated as they reached the door and madetheir way through the multitude who stillthronged the street they found the avenuesguarded by a select party of armed burghersand about fifty spears belonging to the knightof kinfauns who with his allies the graysblairs moncrieffs and others had brought toperth a considerable body of horse of whichthese were a part so soon as the glover andsmith presented themselves they were admittedto the chamber in which the magistrateswere assembledchapter viiithe councilroom of perth presented a singularspectacle in a gloomy apartment illand inconveniently lighted by two windowsof different form and of unequal size were assembledaround a large oaken table a group ofmen of whom those who occupied the higherseats were merchants that is guild brethrenor shopkeepers arrayed in decent dresses becomingtheir station but most of them bearinglike the regent york signs of war aroundtheir aged necks gorgets namely and baltrickswhich sustained their weapons thelower places around the table were occupiedby mechanics and artisans the presidents ordeacons as they were termed of

iron of a lozenge shape which securedthrough the upper angle hung in rowsabove each and which swaying with the motionof the wearer's person formed a secure defenceto the body others had buffcoats whichas already mentioned could resist the blow ofa sword and even a lance's point unless propelledwith great force at the bottom of thetable surrounded as it was with this varied assemblysat sir louis lundin no military manbut a priest and parson of st john's arrayed inhis canonical dress and having his pen and inkbefore him he was townclerk of the burgh andlike all the priests of the period who were calledfrom that circumstance the pope's knightsreceived the honourable title of dominus contractedinto dom or dan or translated intosir the title of reverence due to the secularchivalryon an elevated seat at the head of the councilboard was placed sir patrick charteris incompletearmour brightly burnished a singularcontrast to the motley mixture of warlikeand peaceful attire exhibited by the burgherswho were only called to arms occasionallythe bearing of the provost while it completelyadmitted the intimate connexion which mutualinterests had created betwixt himself the burghand the magistracy was at the same time calculatedto assert the superiority which in virtueof gentle blood and chivalrous rank theopinions of the age assigned to him over themembers of the assembly in which he presidedtwo squires stood behind him one of themholding the knight's pennon and another hisshield bearing his armorial distinctions beinga hand holding a dagger or short sword withthe proud motto

dignitaryvol ii pto whom they belonged was engaged in dischargingthe office of a burgh magistrate in his ownperson the knight of kinfauns appeared to affectsomething of state and stiffness which didnot naturally pertain to his frank and jovialcharacter so you are come at length henry smithand simon glover said the provost knowthat you have kept us waiting for your attendanceshould it so chance again while we occupythis place we will lay such a fine on youas you will have small pleasure in payingenough make no excuses they are not askednow and another time they will not be admittedknow sirs that our reverend clerk hathtaken down in writing and at full length whati will tell you in brief that you may see whatis to be required of you henry smith in particularour late fellowcitizen oliver proudfatehath been found dead in the high streetclose by the entrance into the wynd it seemethhe was slain by a heavy blow with a short axedealt from behind and at unawares and the actbv which he fell can only be termed a deed offoul and forethoiiglit murder so much for thecrime the criminal can only be indicated hycircumstances it is recorded in the protocol ofthe reverend sir louis lundin that diverswellreputed witnesses saw our deceased citizenoliver proudfute till a late period accompanyingthe entry of the morrisdancers of whomhe was one as far as the house of simon gloverin curfew street where they again playedtheir pageant it is also manifested that atthis place he separated from the rest of theband after some discourse with simon gloverand made an appointment to meet with theothers of his company at the sign of the griffinthere to conclude the holiday now simoni demand of you whether this be truly statedso far as you know and further what was thepurport of the defunct oliver proudfute's discoursewith you my lord provost and very worshipful sirpatrick answered simon glover you andthis honourable council shall know that touchingcertain reports which had been made of ieconduct of henry smith some quarrel leadarisen between myself and another of my familyand the said smith here present nowthis our poor fellowcitizen oliver proudfutehaving been active in spreading these reportsas indeed his element lay in such gossipredsome words passed betwixt him and me on thesubject and as i think he left me with thepurpose of visiting henry smith for he brokeoff from the morrisdancers promising as itseems to meet them as your honour has saidat the sign of the griffin in order to concludethe evening but what he actually did i knownot as i never again saw him in lifeit is enough said sir patrick and agreeswith all that we have heard now worthy sirswe next find our poor fellowcitizen environedby a set of revellers and maskers who had assembledin the high street by whom he wasshamefully ill treated being compelled to kneeldown in the street and there to quaff hugequantities of liquor against his inclination untilat length he escaped from them by flight thisviolence was accomplished with drawn swordsloud shouts and imprecations so as to attract theattention of several persons who alarmed bythe tumult looked out from their windows aswell as of one or two passengers who keepingaloof from the light of the torches lest they alsohad been maltreated beheld the usage whichour fellowcitizen received in the high street ofthe burgh and although these revellers weredisguised and used zads yet their disguiseswere well known being a set of quaint maskinghabits prepared some weeks ago by commandof sir john ramorny master of thehorse to his royal highness the duke of rothsayprince royal of scotlanda low groan went through the assemblyyes so it is brave burghers continued sirpatrick our inquiries have led us into conclusionsboth melancholy and terrible but asno one can regret the point at which they seemlikely to arrive more than i do so no mau livingcan dread its consequences less it is even sovarious artisans employed upon the articleshave described the dresses prepared for sir johnjlamornv's mask as beinjr exactly similar tothose oi the men by whom oliver proudtutc wasobserved to be maltreated and one mechanicbeing whitfield the featherdresser who sawthe revellers when they had our fellowcitizenwithin their hands remarked that they worethe cincture and coronals of painted featherswhich he himself had made by the order of theprince's master of the horseafter the moment of his escape from theserevellers we lose all trace of oliver but wecan prove that the maskers went to sir johnramorny's where they were admitted aftersome show of delay it is rumoured that thouhenry smith safest our unhappy fellowcitizenafter he had been in the hands of these revellers what is the truth of that matter he came to my house in she wynd saidhenry about half an hour before midnight and i admitted him something unwillingly ashehad been keeping carnival while i remainedat home and there is ill talk says the proverbbetwixt a full man and a fasting and in which plight seemed he when thoudidst admit him said the provosthe seemed answered the smith out ofbreath and talked repeatedly of having been endangeredby revellers i paid but small regardfor he was ever a timorous chickenspiritedthough wellmeaning man and i held that mwas speaking more from fancy than reality buti shall always account it for foul offence in myselfthat i did not give him my company whichhe requested and if i live i will found massesfor his soul in expiation of my guiltdid he describe those from whom he receivedthe injury said the provostrevellers in masking habits replied henry and did he intimate his fear of having todowith them on his return again demandedsir patrickhe alluded particularly to his being waylaidwhich i treated as visionary having beenable to see no one in the lanehad he then no help from thee of any kindwhatsoever said the provostyes worshipful replied the smith heexchanged his morris dress for my headpiecebuffcoat and target which i hear were foundiipou his body and have at home his morricccap and bells with the jerkin and other thingspertaining he was to return my garb of fenceand get back his own masking suit this day hadthe saints so permitted you saw him not then afterwards never my lordone word more said the provost haveyou any reason to think that the blow whichslew oliver proudfute was meant for anotherman i have answered the smith but it isdoubtful and may be dangerous to add such aconjecture which is besides only a suppositionspeak it out on your burgher faith and oathfor whom think you was the blow meant if i must speak replied henry i believeoliver proudfute received the fate which wasdesigned for myself the rather that in his follyoliver spoke of trying to assume my manner ofwalking as well as my dress have you feud with any one that you formsuch an idea said sir patrick charters to my shame and sin be it spoken ha cloud whli iligliland and lowland english andscot perth and angus i do not believe pooroliver had feud with a newhatched chicken alas he was the more fully prepared for a suddencall hark ye smith said the provost answerme distinctly is there cause of feud betweenthe household of sir john ramorny andyourselfto a certainty my lord there is it is nowgenerally said that black quentin who wentover tay to fife some days since was the ownerof the hand which was found in couvrefewstreet upon the eve of st valentine it was iwho struck off that hand with a blow of mybroadsword as this black quentin was achamberlain of sir john and much trusted itis like there must be feud between me and hismaster's dependentsit bears a likely front smith said sir patrickcharteris and now good brothers andwise magistrates there are two suppositionseach of which leads to the same conclusion themakerswho seized our fellow citizen and misusedliii in a manner of which his body retainssome slight marks may have met with theirformer prisoner as he returned homewards andfinished their ill usage by taking his life hehimself expressed to henry gow fears that thiswould be the case if this be really true oneor more of sir john ramorny's attendantsmust have been the assassins but i think itmore likely that one or two of the revellers mayhave remained on the field or returned to ithaving changed perhaps their disguise and thatto those men for oliver proudfute in his ownpersonal appearance would only have been asubject of sport his apparition in the dress andassuming as he proposed to do the mannerof henry smith was matter of deep hatredand that seeing him alone they had taken asthey thought a certain and safe mode to ridthemselves of an enemy so dangerous as all menknow henry wynd is accounted by those thatare his friends the same train of reasoningagain rests the guilt with the household of sirjohn ramorny how think you siis arewe not free to charge the crime upon them the magistrates whispered together for severalminutes and then replied by the voice ofbailie craigdallie noble knight and ourworthy provost we agree entirely in whatyour wisdom has spoken concerning this darkand bloody matter nor do we doubt your sagacityin tracing to the fellowship and the companyof john ramorny of that ilk the villainywhich hath been done to our deceased fellowcitizenwhether in his own character and capacityor as mistaking him for our brave townsmanhenry of the wynd but sir john in hisown behalf and as the prince's master of thehorse maintains an extensive household andas of course the charge will be rebutted by a denialwe would ask how we shall proceed in thatcase it is true could we find law for firingthe lodging and putting all within it to thesword the old proverb of short rede goodrede might here apply for a fouler householdof defiers of god destroyers of men and debaucheryof women are nowhere sheltered thanare in ramorny's band but i doubt that thissummary mode of execution would scarce beburne out by the laws and no tittle of evidencewhich i have heard will tend to fix the crimeon any single individual or individualsbefore the provost could reply the townclerkarose and stroking his venerable beardcraved permission to speak which was instantlygranted brethren he said as well inour fathers time as ours hath god on beingrightly appealed to condescended to make manifestthe crimes of the guilty and the innocenceof those who may have been rashly accusedlet us demand from our sovereign lord kingrobert who when the wicked do not interfereto pervert his good intentions is as just andclement a prince as our annals can show intheir long line in the name of the fair city andof all the commons in scotland that he give usafter the fashion of our ancestors the means ofappealing to heaven for light upon this darkmurder we will demand the proof by hierrightsoften granted in the days of our sovereign'sancestors approved of by bulls and decretalsand administered by the great emperorcharlemagne in france by king artlinr inbritain and by gregory the great and themighty aclriius in this our land of scotlandi have heard of the bierright sir louisfjuoth the provost and i know we have it inour charters of the fail city but i am somethingilllearned in the ancient laws and wouldpray you to inform us more distinctly of its nature we will demand of the king said sirlouis lundin my advice being taken that thebody of our murdered fellowcitizen be transportedinto the high church of st john's andsuitable masses said for the benefit of his souland for the discovery of his foul murder meantimewe shall obtain an order that sir john ramorngive up a list of such of his householdas were in perth in the course of the night betweenfastern's even and this ash wednesdayand become bound to present them on a certainday and hour to be early named in the highchurch of st john's there one by one to passbefore the bier of our murdered fellow citizenand in trio form prescribed to call upon god andhis saints to bear witness that he is innocent ofthe acting art or part of the murder andcredit me as has been indeed proved by numerousinstances that if the murderer shall endeavourto shroud himself by making such an appealthe antipathy which subsists between thedead body and the hand which dealt the fatalblow that divorced it from the soul will awakensome imperfect life under the influence of whichthe veins of the dead man will pour forth at thefatal wounds the blood which has been so longstagnant in the veins or to speak more certainlyit is the pleasure of heaven by somehidden agency which we cannot comprehend toleave open this mode of discovering the wickednessof him who has defaced the image of hiscreatori have heard this law talked of said sirpatrick and it was enforced in the bruce'stime this surely is no unfit period to seek bysuch a mystic mode of inquiry the truth towhich no ordinary means can give us accessseeing that a general accusation of sir john'shousehold would full surely be met by a generaldenial yet i must crave farther of sirlouis our reverend townclerk how we shallprevent the guilty person from escaping in theinterim the burghers will maintain a strict watchupon the wall drawbridges shall be raisedand portcullises lowered from sunset to sunriseand strong patrols maintained through thenight this guard the burghers will willinglymaintain to secure against the escape of themurderer of their townsmanthe rest of the councillors acquiesced bywordsign and look in this proposalagain said the provost what if anyoneof the suspected household refuse to submitto the ordeal of bierright he may appeal to that of combat saidthe reverend city scribe with an opponentof equal rank because the accused person musthave his choice in the appeal to the judgmentof god by what ordeal he will be tried butif he refuses both he must be held as guiltyand so punishedthe sages of the council unanimously agreedwith the opinion of their provost and townclerkand resolved in all formality to petitionthe king as a matter of right that the murderof their fellowcitizen should be inquired intoaccording to this ancient form which was heldto manifest the truth and received as matter ofevidence in case of murder so late as towardsthe end of the seventeenth century but beforethe meeting dissolved bailie craigdallie thoughtit meet to inquire who was to be the championof maudie or magdalen proudfute and hertwo children there need be little inquiry about thatsaid sir patrick charteris we are men andwear swords which should be broken over thehead of any one amongst us who will not drawit in behalf of the widow and orphans of ourmurdered fellowcitizen and in brave revengeof his death if sir john ramorny shall personallyresent the inquiry patrick charteris ofkinfauns will do battle with him to the outrancewhilst horse and man may stand or spearand blade hold together but in case the challengerbe of yeomanly degree well wot i thatmagdalen proudfute may choose her own championamong the bravest burghers of perth andshame and dishonour were it to the fair cityfor ever could she light upon one who was traitorand coward enough to say her nay bringher hither that she may make her electionhenry smith heard this with a melancholyanticipation that the poor woman's choice wouldlight upon him and that his recent reconciliationwith his mistress would be again dissolvedby his being engaged in a fresh quarrel fromwhich there lay no honourable means of escapeand which in any other circumstanceshe would have welcomed as a glorious opportunityof distinguishing himself both in sight ofthe court and of the city he was aware thatunder the tuition of father clement catharineviewed the ordeal of battle rather as aninsult to religion than an appeal to the deityand did not consider it as reasonable that superiorstrength of arm or skill of weaponshould be resorted to as the proof of moralvol ii guilt or innocence he had therefore muchto fear from her peculiar opinions in this particularrefined as they were beyond those ofthe age she lived inwhile he thus

and saluted them with an expression ofthe deepest sympathy which magdalen thoughthe mate of poor oliver returned with an airof dignity which she borrowed perhaps fromthe extremity of her distress sir patrick chartersthen stepped forward and with the courtesyof a knight to a female and of a protectorto an oppressed and injured widow took the poorwoman's hand and explained to her briefly bywhat course the city had resolved to follow outthe vengeance due for her husband's slaughterhaving with a softness and gentleness whichdid not belong to his general manner ascertainedthat the unfortunate woman perfectlyunderstood what was meant he said aloud to theassembly goodcitizensof perth and freebornmen of guild and craft attend to what is aboutto pass foritconcerns your rights and

thegeneral prompting of their looks as soon assir patrick had spoken she crossed the floor tothe place where near the bottom of the tablethe armourer stood among the men of his degreeand took him by the hand henry gow or smith she said goodburgher and craftsman my my husband she would have said but the wordwould not come forth she was obliged tochange the expressionhe who is gone loved and prized you overallmen therefore meet it is that thou shouldstfollow out the quarrel of his widow and orphansif there had been a possibility which in thatage there was not of henry's rejecting or escapingfrom a trust for which all men seemedto destine him every wish and idea of retreatwas cut off when the widow began to addresshim and a command from heaven could hardlyhave made a stronger impression than did theappeal of the unfortunate magdalen her allusionto his intimacy with the deceased movedhim to the soul during oliver's life doubtlessthere had been a strain of absurdity in hisexcessive predilection for henry which consideringhow very different they were in characterhad in it something ludicrous but all thiswas now forgotten and henry giving way tohis natural ardour only remembered that oliverhad been his friend and intimate a manwho had loved and honoured him as much as hewas capable of entertaining such sentiments forany one and above all that there was much reasonto suspect that the deceased had fallen victimto a blow meant for henry himselfit was therefore with an alacrity which theminute before he could scarce have commandedand which seemed to express a stern pleasurethat having pressed his lips to the coldbrow of the unhappy magdalen the armourerreplied i henry the smith dwelling in the wyndof perth good man and true and freely bornaccept the office of

charteris for his majesty's considerationthis is an unhappy matter brother robinhe said a most unhappy occurrence andgoes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt thenobility and the commons here as they havebeen at war together in so many distant landsi see but one cause of comfort in the matter and that is that sir john ramorny having receivedhis dismissal from the duke of rothsay'sfamily it cannot be said that he or any of hispeople who may have done this bloody deed ifit has truly been done by them have been encouragedor hounded out upon such an errandby my poor robin i am sure brother

scarcely beyond the years ofboyhood bore on his brow the deep impressionof early thought and premature passion thiswas that celebrated lindsay earl of crawfordwho in his after days was known by the epithetof the tiger earl and who ruled the great andrich valley of stratford with the absolutepower and unrelenting cruelty of a feudal tyranttwo or three gentlemen friends of the earl orof his own countenanced sir john ramornyby their presence on this occasion the chargewas again stated and met by a broad denial onthe part of the accused and in reply the challengersoffered to prove their assertion by anappeal to the ordeal of bierrighti am not bound answered sir john ramorn to submit to this ordeal since i canprove by the evidence of my late royal masterthat i was in my own lodgings lying on mybed ill at ease while this provost and thesebailies pretend i was committing a crime towhich i had neither will nor temptation ican therefore be no just object of suspicioni can aver said the prince that i sawand conversed with sir john ramorny aboutsome matters concerning my own household onthe very night when this murder was adoingi therefore know that he was ill at ease andcould not in person commit the deed in questionbut i know nothing of the employmentof his attendants and will not take it upon meto say that some one of them may not have beenguilty of the crime now charged on themsir john ramorny had during the beginningof this speech looked round with an air ofdefiance which was somewhat disconcerted bythe concluding sentence of rothsay's speechi thank your highness he said with a smilefor your cautious and limited testimony in mybehalf he was wise who wrote put not yourfaith in princes if you have no other evidence of your innocencesir john ramorny said the king we

them do appear at the time ofhigh mass otherwise your honour may be sorelytaintedthey shall attend to a man said sir johnramcrny then bowing low to the king hedirected himself to the young duke of rothsayand making a deep obeisance spoke so asto be heard by him alone you have usedme generously my lord one word of yourlips could have ended this controversy and youhave refused to speak it on my life whispered the prince ispake as far as the extreme verge of truth andconscience would permit i think thou could'stnot expect i should frame lies for thee and afterall john in my broken recollections of thatnight i do bethink me of a butcherlylookingmute with a curtalaxe much like such a oneas may have done yonder nightjob ha havei touched you sir knight ramorny made no answer but turned awayas precipitately as if some one had pressed suddenlyon his wounded arm and regained hislodgings with the earl of crawford to whomthough disposed for anything rather than revelryhe was obliged to offer a splendid collationto acknowledge in some degree his sense of thecountenance which the young noble had affordedhimchapter xwhen after an entertainment the prolongingof which was like

which dwining exercised overhim and was in the encounter of their wits oftenmastered by him as the most eccentric effortsof a fiery horse are overcome by a boy oftwelve years old if he has been bred to the artsof the manege but the contempt of dwining forramorny was far less qualified he regarded theknight in comparison with himself as scarcelyrising above the brute creation capable indeedof working destruction as the bull with hishorns or the wolf with his fangs but masteredby mean prejudices and a slave to priestcraftin which phrase dwining included religionof every kind on the whole he consideredramorny as one whom nature had assigned tohim as a serf to mine for the gold which he worshippedand the avaricious love of which washis greatest failing though by no means hisworst vice he
