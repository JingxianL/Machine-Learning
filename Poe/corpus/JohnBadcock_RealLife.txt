the kindassistance of the rosy god become at the same moment most animatednot to say vociferous orators the young squire bob tally ho as hewas called of belville hall who had recently come into possession ofthis fine and extensive domain was far from feeling indifferent to thepleasures of a sporting life and in the chace had even acquired thereputation of being a keen sportsman but the regular intercoursewhich took place between him and his cousin the hon tom dashall ofbond street notoriety had in some measure led to an indecisionof character and often when perusing the lively and fascinatingdescriptions which the latter drew of the passing scenes in thegay metropolis bob would break out into an involuntary exclamationof curse me but after all this only is real life while for

if the horsewhip had actually made its entrance tomand his companion stole away and left the astounded monarch with thewords twas all a dreamwhile returning to the inn our heroes mutually commented on theambition and folly of those amateurs of fashion who not only sacrificetime and property but absolutely take abundant pains to renderthemselves ridiculous certainly says tom this cacoethes

an enthusiast and a tool of party his adherenceto the rights of the subject and his perseverance to uphold theprinciples of the constitution are deserving the admiration of everyenglishman and although his fortune is princely and has been at hiscommand ever since an early age he has never had his name registeredamong the fashionable gamesters at the clubs in st james'sstreetnewmarket or elsewhere he labours in the vineyard of utility ratherthan in the more luxuriant garden of folly and according to generalconception may emphatically be called an honest man but come saidtom it is time

half past six to dinner consequently allwas prepared for their reception the style of elegance in which tomappeared to move struck tallyhoho at once with delight and astonishmentas they entered the drawingroom which was superbly and tastefullyfitted up and commanded a cheerful view of piccadilly welcome mydear bob said tom to his cousin to all the delights of town cometell me what you think of its first appearance only remember youcommence your studies of life in london on a dull day tomorrow youwill have more enlivening prospects before you why in truthreplied bob the rapidity of attraction is such as at present to leaveno distinct impressions on my mind all appears like enchantment andi am completely bewildered in a labyrinth of wonders to which thereappears to be no end but under your kind guidance and tuition i mayprove myself an apt scholar in unravelling its intricacies by thistime they had approached the windowaye aye says dashall we shall not be long i see without someobject to exercise your mind upon and dispel the horrorsoh for that muse of fire whose burning penrecords the godlike deeds of valiant menthen might our humble yet aspiring verseour matchless hero's matchless deeds rehearsebob was surprised at this sudden exclamation of his cousin andfrom the introduction naturally expected something extraordinary thoughhe looked around him without discovering his objectthat continued tom is a peer pointing to a gig just turning thecorner of whom it may be saidto many a jovial club that peer was knownwith whom his active wit unrivall'd shonechoice spirit grave freemason buck and bloodwould crowd his stories and bon mots to hearand none a disappointment e'er need fearhis humour flow'd in such a copious floodit is lord c who was formerly well known as the celebrated majorh the companion of the now most distinguished personage in thebritish dominions and who not long since became possessed of hislordly honours some particulars of him are worth knowing he wasearly introduced into life and often kept both good and bad companyassociating with men and women of every description and of every rankfrom the highest to the lowest from st james's to st giles's inpalaces and nightcellars from the drawingroom to the dustcart hecan drink swear tell stories cudgel box and smoke with any onehaving by his intercourse with society fitted himself for all companieshis education has been more practical than theoretical though he wasbrought up at eton where notwithstanding he made considerable progressin his studies he took such an aversion to greek that he never wouldlearn it previous to his arrival at his present title he used to becalled honest george and so unalterable is his nature that to thishour he likes it and it fits him better than his title but he hasoften been sadly put to his shifts under various circumstances he wasa courtier but was too honest for that he tried gaming but he was toohonest for that he got into prison and might have wiped off but hewas too honest for that he got into the coal trade but he found it ablack business and he was too honest for that at drawing the longbowso much perhaps cannot be said but that you know is habit notprinciple his courage is undoubted having fought three duels before hewas twenty years of agebeing disappointed in his hope of promotion in the army he resolved inspite of the remonstrances of his friends to quit the guardsand solicited an appointment in one of the hessian corps at thattime raising for the british service in america where the war of therevolution was then commencing and obtained from the landgrave of hessea captain's commission in his corps of wagersprevious to his departure for america finding he had involved himselfin difficulties by a profuse expenditure too extensive for his incomeand an indulgence in the pleasures of the turf to a very great extenthe felt himself under the necessity of mortgaging an estate of aboutl per annum left him by his aunt and which proved unequal tothe liquidation of his debts he remained in america till the end of thewar where he distinguished himself for bravery and suffered much withthe yellow fever on his return he obtained an introduction to theprince of wales who by that time had launched into public life andbecame one of the jovial characters whom he selected for his associatesand many are the amusing anecdotes related of him the prince conferredon him the appointment of equerry with a salary of l a year thishowever he lost on the retrenchments that were afterwards made in thehousehold of his royal highness he continued however to be one ofhis constant companions and while in his favour they were accustomedto practice strange vagaries the major was always a wag ripe and readyfor a spree or a lark to him a frolic was a high delighta frolic he would hunt for day and nightcareless how prudence on the sport might frownat one time when the favourite's finances were rather low and themosses ran taper it was remarked among the vivants of theparty that the major had not for some time given them an invitationthis however he promised to do and fixed the day the princehaving engaged to make one upon this occasion he took lodgings intottenhamcourt road went to a winemerchant promised to introducehim to the royal presence upon his engaging to find wine for the partywhich was readily acceded to and a dinner of three courses was servedup three such courses perhaps were never before seen when thecompany were seated two large dishes appeared one was placed at thetop of the table and one at the bottom all was anxious expectationthe covers being removed exhibited to view a baked shoulder ofmutton at top and baked potatoes at the bottom they all looked aroundwith astonishment but knowing the general eccentricity of their hostthey readily fell into his humour and partook of his fare not doubtingbut the second course would make ample amends for the first the winewas good and the major apologized for his accommodations being as hesaid a family sort of man and the dinner though somewhat uncommonwas not such an one as is described by goldsmithat the top a fried liver and bacon were seenat the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureenat the sides there were spinach and pudding made hotin the middle a place where the pasty was notat length the second course appeared when lo and behold another bakedshoulder of mutton and baked potatoes surprise followed surprise butanother and another still succeedsthe third course consisted of the same fare clearly proving that hehad in his catering studied quantity more than variety however theyenjoyed the joke eat as much as they pleased laughed heartily at thedinner and after simpering till a late hour took their departure itis said however that he introduced the winemerchant to his highnesswho afterwards profited by his orders this remarkable dinner reminds us of a laughablecaricature which made its appearance some time ago upon themarriage of a jew attorney in jewrystreet lydgate to thedaughter of a wellknown fishmonger of st peter'salleycornhill when a certain baronet alderman colonel andthen lord mayor opened the ball at the london tavern asthe partner of the bride a circumstance which excitedconsiderable curiosity and surprise at the time we know theworthy baronet had been a hunter for a seat in parliamentbut what he could be hunting among the children of israelisperhaps not so easily ascertained we however are notspeaking of the character but the caricature whichrepresented the bride not resting on abraham's bosom butseated on his knee surrounded by their guests at themarriagefeast while to a panel just behind them appearsto be affixed a bill of fare which runs thusfirst course fishsecond course fishthird course fishperhaps the idea of the artist originated in the anecdoteabove recordedit is reported that the prince gave him a commission under anexpress promise that when he could not shew it he was no longer toenjoy his royal favour this commission was afterwards lost by theimprovident possessor and going to call on the donor one morning whoespying him on his way he threw up the sash and called out wellgeorge commission or no commission no commission by g yourhighness was the replythen you cannot enter here rejoined the prince closing the windowand the connection at the same timehis lordship now resides in the regent's park and may almost nightlybe seen at a publichouse in the neighbourhood where he takes his grogand smokes his pipe amusing the company around him with anecdotes ofhis former days we may perhaps fall in with him some night inour travels and you will find him a very amusing and sometimes verysensible sort of fellow till he gets his grog on board when he can beas boisterous and blustering as a coalheaver or a bully his presentfortune is impaired by his former imprudence but he still mingles withthe sporting world and a short time back had his pocket picked at amilling match of a valuable gold repeater he has favoured the worldwith several literary productions among which are

hairbrain was born of a good family and at thedecease of his father became possessed of ten thousand pounds whichhe sported with more zeal than discretion so much so that having beenintroduced to the gaming table by a pretended friend and fluctuatedbetween poverty and affluence for four years he found himselfconsiderably in debt and was compelled to seek refuge in an obscurelodging somewhere in the neighbourhood of tilbury in order to avoidthe traps for as he observes he has been among the greeks andpigeons who have completely looked him and now want to crowover him he has been at hide and

uninteresting or unprofitablei can assure you replied tallyhoho i am delighted with the accurateknowledge you appear to have of society in general while i regret thesituation of the actors in scenes so glowingly described and am onlyastonished at the appearance of such personsyou must not be astonished at appearances rejoined dashall forappearance is every thing in london and i must particularly warn younot to found your judgment upon it there is an old adage which says'to be poor and seem poor is the devil all over why if you meetone of these sundaymen he will accost you with urbanity and

carried onhis fraudulent schemes to the last moment of his existence for hedefrauded jack ketch of his fee by hanging himself in his cellafter condemnationjust as a tilbury was passing observe said tom the driver of thattilbury is the celebrated lord cripplegate with his usual equipage hisblue cloak with a scarlet lining hanging loosely over the vehiclegives an air of importance to his appearance and he is always attendedby that boy who has been denominated his cupid he is a noblemanby birth a gentleman by courtesy and a gamester by profession heexhausted a large estate upon odd and even sevens the main c tillhaving lost sight of the main chance he found it necessary to curtailhis establishment and enliven his prospects by exchanging a first floorfor a second without an opportunity of ascertaining whether or notthese alterations were best suited to his high notions or exalted tastefrom which in a short time he was induced either by inclination ornecessity to take a small lodging in an obscure street and to sporta gig and one horse instead of a curricle and pair though in formertimes he used to drive four in hand and was acknowledged to be anexcellent whip he still however possessed money enough to collecttogether a large quantity of halfpence which in his hours of relaxationhe managed to turn to good account by the following stratagem hedistributed his halfpence on the floor of his little parlour in straightlines and ascertained how many it would require to cover it havingthus prepared himself he invited some wealthy spendthrifts with whomhe still had the power of associating to sup with him and he welcomedthem to his habitation with much cordiality the glass circulatedfreely and each recounted his gaming or amorous adventures till a latehour when the effects of the bottle becoming visible he proposed as amomentary suggestion to name how many halfpence laid side by side wouldcarpet the floor and offered to lay a large charles price the wellknown impostor whose extensiveforgeries on the bank of england rendered him notorious mayserve as a practical illustration of puff for he atseveral periods of his life carried on his system of fraudby advertisements and by personating the character of aclergyman collecting subscriptions under various pretenceshis whole life is marked with determined and systematicdepravity he hanged himself in tothilfields bridewellwhere he was confined at the age of fiftyfivewager that he would guess the nearest done done was echoedround the room every one made a deposit of l and every one made aguess equally certain of success and his lordship declaring he hada large lot of halfpence by him though perhaps not enough theexperiment was to be tried immediately twas an excellent hit the roomwas cleared to it they went the halfpence were arranged rank and filein military order when it appeared that his lordship had certainlyguessed as well he might nearest to the number the consequence wasan immediate alteration of his lordship's residence and appearance hegot one step in the world by it he gave up his secondhand gig forone warranted new and a change in his vehicle may pretty generally beconsidered as the barometer of his pocketdo you mark he is hearing at that pretty girl on the other side of theway he is fond of the wenches and has been a true votary of fashionperhaps there is not a more perfect model of real life in london thanmight be furnished from the memoirs of his lordship he is rather a goodlooking man as he sits and prides himself on being a striking likenessof his present majesty but unfortunately has a lameness whichimpedes him in the ardour of his pursuit of game although it must beacknowledged he has been a game one in his time the boy you see withhim is reported to be his own son who is now employed by him as anassistant in all his amorous adventureshis own son exclaimed bobaye and if so a merrily begotten one i'll be bound for itcontinued tom such things will happen and his lordship has kept avery pretty assortment of servant girls but the introduction of thisyouth to public notice was somewhat curious it is said that having alarge party of bon vivants to dine with him on sitting down to tableand taking the cover off one of the dishes a plump and smiling infantappeared a sweet little cupid byexclaimed his lordship i'll be his father i'lltake care of him call rose and tell her to look out for a nurse forhim thus taking upon himself the character of parent and protector aswell as parson young cupid was christened in libations of claret andfurnished a fund of amusement for the evening how young cupid camethere i believe has not yet been satisfactorily ascertainedwho seeks a friend should come disposedt exhibit in full bloom disclosedthe graces and the beautiesthat form the character he seeksfor tis an union that bespeaksreciprocated dutiesand thus it has proved with cupid himself the offspring of an illicitamour is now constantly engaged in promoting othershis lordship had three brothers billingsgate delegate andnewgate whose names are adorned with a similarity of perfections inthe temple of fame but they are consigned to the tomb of the capuletand we will not rake up the ashes of the deadat this moment a loud knocking was heard at the door and mr sparklewas ushered into the drawingroom which he entered as it were with ahop step and jump and had tom dashall by the hand almost before theycould turn round to see who it wasmy dear fellow exclaimed sparkle almost out of breath where haveyou been to time has been standing still since your departure therehas been a complete void in nature how do you do i beg pardonturning to bob you will excuse my rapture at meeting my old friendwhom i have lost so long that i have almost lost myself egad i haverun myself out of breath cursed unlucky i was not in the park thismorning to see you first but i have just heard all about you from ladyjane and lost no time in paying my respects what are you going to dowith yourself there was a delicate propriety in this conduct of the hontom dashall which cannot but be admired for although theywere alone and speaking to each other in perfectconfidence it was always his desire to avoid as much aspossible making bad worse he had a heart to feel as wellas a head to think and would rather lend a hand to raise afellowcreature from the mud than walk deliberately overhim besides he foresaw other opportunities would arise inwhich from circumstances he would almost be compelled todraw his cousin's attention again to the persons inquestion and he was always unwilling to exhast a subjectof an interesting nature without sonic leading occurrence towarrant itat this moment dinner was announced come said tom let usrefresh a bit and after dinner i will tell you all about it we aretravellers you know and feel a little fatigued allons allons andso saying he led the way to the dinnerroomnothing could be more apropos said sparkle for although i havetwo engagements beforehand and have promised a visit to you know who inthe evening they appear like icicles that must melt before the sun ofyour reappearance so i am your's and to it they went tom alwayskept a liberal table and gave his friends a hearty welcome but hereit will be necessary while they are regaling themselves to makeour readers a little acquainted with charles sparkle esq for whichpurpose we must request his patience till the next chapterchapter vplace me thou great supreme in that blest stateunknown to those the silly world call greatwhere all my wants may be with ease supply'dyet nought superfluous to pamper prideit will be seen in the previous chapter that the formal ceremonyof a fashionable introduction such as mr sparkle my friend mrrobert tallyhohohoho of belville hall mr tallyhohohoho mr charles sparkle wasaltogether omitted indeed the abrupt entrance of the latter renderedit utterly impossible for although sparkle was really a wellbred manhe had heard from lady jane of tom's arrival with his young friend fromthe country etiquette between themselves was at all times completelyunnecessary an air of gaiety and freedom as the friend of dashall wasintroduction enough to bob and consequently this point of good breedingwas wholly unnoticed by all the party but we are not yet sufficientlyacquainted with our readers to expect a similar mode of proceeding willbe overlooked we shall therefore lose no time in giving our promisedaccount of mr sparkle and beg to introduce him accordinglymr reader mr sparkle mr sparkle mr readerhold sir what are you about you have bewildered yourself withetiquette and seem to know as little about life in london as thenovice you have already introduced by the way that introduction wasone of the most extraordinary i ever met with this may be equally sofor ought i know and i really begin to suspect you are an extraordinaryfellow yourself how can you introduce me of whom you know nothingegad i believe you have me there a palpable hit my lord or mylady for i certainly cannot say which i was getting myself into anawkward dilemma but i hate suspicionsuspicion ever haunts the guilty mindmethinks i see a frown but i meant no offence and if you throwdown my book in a rage you will perhaps not only remain ignorant ofmr sparkle but what is more important of those

permissionwould willingly not be impeded in my progress and under suchexpectations i shall proceedcharles sparkle was the son and only child of a right hon member ofparliament now no more whose mother dying soon after his birth wasleft destitute of that maternal kindness and solicitude which frequentlyhas so much influence in forming the character of the future manhis father a man of eccentric turn of mind being appointed soonafterwards to a diplomatic situation abroad left the care of his son'seducation to an elderly friend of his who held a situation of someimportance under the then existing government with an injunction toconceal from the boy the knowledge of his real parent and to bring himup as his own childthis important trust was executed with tenderness and fidelity the boygrew in strength and ripened in intelligence and being accustomedto consider his protector as his parent the father upon returningto england determined not to undeceive him until he should arrive atyears of discretion and with this view mr oxford was instructed at aproper age to send him to oxfordcharles however had contracted before this period habits andacquaintances in london that were completely in opposition to thedictates and inclinations of his supposed father he became passionatelyfond of literary amusements music and drawing which served to occupyhis morning hours but his evenings were devoted to the company ofvitiated associates who did not fail to exercise their influenceover his youthful passions and he frequently engaged himself in unluckyand improvident adventures which involved him in pecuniary difficultiesfar beyond his stipulated income these circumstances were no soonermade known to the supposed parent than they excited his displeasureand being carried to an unpardonable extent he was at the age ofeighteen literally banished the house of his protector and compelledto take an obscure lodging in the vicinity of london the rent of whichwas paid for him and a scanty allowance of one guinea sent to himregularly every saturday night thus secluded from his old associatesit will not be wondered at that he contrived to form new ones andhaving purchased an old harpsichord turned the musical instructionhe had received to occasional account he also wrote some politicalpamphlets which were well received but this solitary and dependent lifewas wholly unsuited to the gaiety in which he had hitherto moved ithad however the effect of drawing forth talent which perhaps wouldnever but for this circumstance have been discovered formany a gem of purest ray serenethe dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bearfull many a flower is born to blush unseenand waste its sweetness on the desert airhis writings c under the name of oribrd were recognised by the realfather as the productions of a promising son at his instigation andupon a promise of reform he was again restored to his former home andshortly after entered as a gentleman commoner of st mary's oxford butnot till he had by some means or other made the discovery thatoxford was not his real name congenial spirits are naturally fond ofassociating and it was here that he first became acquainted with thehon tom dashall they were constant companions and mutual assistants toeach other in all their exercises as well as all their vagaries soas to cement a friendship and interest in each other's fate up to themoment of which we are now speakingoxford however was at that time more impetuous and less discreetin the pursuit of his pleasures than his honourable friend and afterobtaining the distinction of bachelor of arts was in consequence ofhis imprudence and irregularities after frequently hairbreadthescapes expelled the college this circumstance however appeared oflittle consequence to him he hired a gig at oxford promising to returnin a few days and came up to london but had not effrontery enough toventure into the presence of his reputed father on arrival in town heput up at an inn in the borough where he resided till all the moneyhe had was exhausted and till as he emphatically observes he hadactually eaten his horse and chaisein the mean time the people at oxford found he was expelled and ashehad not returned according to appointment he was pursued andeventually found they had no doubt of obtaining their demand fromhis friends and he was arrested at the suit of the lender which wasimmediately followed by a retainer from the innkeeper where he hadresided in town application was made to mr oxford for his liberationwithout effect in consequence of which he became a resident in therules of the king's bench as his friends conceived by this means hishabits would be corrected and his future conduct be amended his realfather still keeping in the back groundwhile in this confinement he again resorted to the produce of his penand his talent for musical composition and his friend tom at the firstvacation did not fail to visit him during this time in the shapeof donation from mr oxford he received occasional supplies more thanequal to his necessities though not to his wishes while here hefished out some further clue to the real parent who visited him indisguise during his confinement as a friend of mr oxford stillhowever he had no chance of liberation till being one day called onby mr oxford he was informed he was at perfect liberty to leave hispresent abode and was directed to go with him immediately a coach wascalled and he heard the direction given to drive to bedford squarewhere they arrived just time enough to learn that the right hon s shad breathed his last after a lingering illnessupon alighting from the coach and receiving this information they wereushered into the drawingroom and presently joined by a clergyman whohad been the chaplain of the deceased who acquainted our adventurer ofthe death of his parent that by will he was entitled to lper annum and a handsome estate in wiltshire this sudden reverseof fortune to sparkle the change from confinement to liberty fromindigence to affluence awakened sensations more easily to be conceivedthan described he wept perhaps the first tears of sincerity in hislife his heart was subdued by an overwhelming flood of affection forthat unknown being whom he now found had been his constant guardianangel alternately taking oxford and the reverend divine by the handand hiding his head in the bosom of his reputed father at length theyled him to the room in which were the remains of his lamented parentthere are perhaps few circumstances better calculated to impress aweon the youthful mind than the contemplation of those features in deathwhich have been respected and revered while living such respect hadever been entertained by charles sparkle for the supposed friend ofmr oxford from whom he had several times received the most kind andaffectionate advice and his sensations upon discovering that friendto be no other than his own father may be more easily conceived thandescribed he was at once exalted and humbled delighted and afflictedhe threw himself in an agony of feeling by the bedside fell on hisknees in which he was joined by the clergyman and oxford where heremained some timeafter the first paroxysms of grief had subsided young sparkle who hadalready felt the strongest impression that could possibly be made ona naturally good heart gave orders for the funeral of his deceasedfather and then proceeded to make other arrangements suitable tothe character he was hereafter to sustain through life went downto wiltshire and took possession of his estate where for a time hesecluded himself and devoted his attention to the perusal of thebest authors in the english french and italian language under thesuperintendence of the reverend divine who had been a resident for manyyears with his fatherbut a life in the country could not long have superior charms for ayoung man who had already seen much to admire as well as much to avoidin the metropolis the combination however of theoretical informationhe had derived from books as well as the practical observations he hadmade during his residence in london fitted him at once for thegayest and most distinguished circles of metropolitan societyhe therefore arranged with mr oxford who had formerly acted as hisparent to continue with him in the capacity of steward and for thelast two years of his life had been almost a constant resident atlong's hotel in bond street not choosing to have the charge of anestablishment in town and the early friendship and attachment whichhad been cultivated at oxford being again renewed appeared to grow withtheir growth and strengthen with their strengthsparkle had still a large portion of that vivacity for which he was soremarkable in his younger days his motives and intentions were at alltimes good and if he indulged himself in the pursuits of frolic andfun it was never at the expence of creating an unpleasant feeling to anhonest or honourable mind his fortune was ample he had a hand to giveand a heart to forgive no malice or hatred were there to be foundbut of these qualifications and the exercise of them sufficient traitswill be given in the ensuing pages no man was better up to the rigsof the town no one better down to the manoeuvres of the flats andsharps he had mingled with life in all companies he was at once anelegant and interesting companion his views were extensive upon allsubjects his conversation lively and his manners polishedsuch gentle reader is the brief sketch of charles sparkle theesteemed friend of the hon tom dashall and with such recommendationsit will not be wondered at if he should become also the friend nd sure to do her goodso much for living in style and good breedingthat's your true breeding that's your sort my boysfun fire and pathos metre mirth and noiseto make you die with laughter or the hiccupstickle your favourites or smash your teacupsby the way in former times the term goodbreeding meant acombination of all that was amiable and excellent and a wellbredperson would shrink from an action or expression that could possiblywound the feelings of another its foundation was laid in truth andits supporting pillars were justice and integrity sensibility andphilanthropy butin this gay age in taste's enlighten'd timeswhen fashion sanctifies the basest crimese'en not to swear and game were impolitesince he who sins in style must sure be righta wellbred person must learn to smile when he is angry and to laugheven when he is vexed to the very soulit would be the height of mauvaise honte for a welled person toblush upon any occasions whatever no young lady blushes after elevenyears of age to study the expression of the countenance of others inorder to govern your own is indispensably necessaryin former times no wellbred person would have uttered a falsehoodbut now such ideas are completely exploded and such conduct would nowbe termed a bore my lord portly remarks it is a cold day yes mylord it is a very cold day replies major punt in two minutes aftermeeting lord lounge who observes he thinks the weather very warm yesvery warm my lord is the reply thus contradicting himself almost inthe same breath it would be perfectly inconsistent in a wellbredman to think for fear of being absent when he enters or leaves adrawingroom he should round his shoulders drop his head andimitate a clown or a coachman this has the effect of the best rusede guerre for it serves to astonish the ladies when they afterwardsdiscover by the familiarity of his address and his unrestrainedmanners what a wellbred man he is for he will address every fair onein the room in the most enchanting terms except her to whom in the sameparty he had previously paid the most particular attention and on herhe will contrive to turn his back for the whole evening and if he is aman of fashion he will thus cause triumph to the other ladies and savethe neglected fair one from envious and slanderous whisperingsan admirable picture of living in style and good breeding indeedcried tom the game is in view and well worth pursuit so hark forwardhark forward my boyssparkle now recollecting his engagement with you know who as hesignificantly observed in the last chapter withdrew after promising totake a stroll by way of killing an hour or two with them in the morningand tom and his cousin soon after retired to restperchance to sleep perchance to dreamchapter vithe alarm was so strongso loud and so longtwas surely some robber or spritewho without any doubtwas prowling aboutto fill ev'ry heart with affrightthe smiles of a may morning bedecked with the splendid rays of arising sun awakened tallyhoho about five o'clock and being accustomed torise early in the country he left the downy couch of soft repose andsought his way down stairs not a sound of any kind was to be heard inthe house but the rattling of the carts and the coaches in the streetswith the deeptoned accompaniment of a fustian's bell and an occasionalab libitum of clothes clothes sale gave bob an idea that all theworld was moving however he could find nobody up he walked into thedrawingroom amused himself for some time by looking out of the windowindulging his observations and remarks without knowing what to make ofthe moving mass of incongruities which met his eye and wondering whattime the servants of the house would wake he tried the streetdoor butfound it locked bolted and chained and if he had known where to havefound his friend tom he would have aroused him with the view halloo it is strange thought he to himself all the world seems abroadand yet not a soul stirring here then checking the current of hisreflections but this said he is life in london egad i must notmake a noise because it will not be good breeding in this way hesauntered about the house for near two hours till at last espying hisportmanteau which had been left in the passage by the servants theprevious evening i'll carry this up stairs said he by way ofamusement and carelessly shouldering the portmanteau he was walkingdeliberately up stairs when his ears were suddenly attracted by aloud cry of murder murder thieves murder and the violent ringingof a bell alarmed at these extraordinary sounds which appeared to benear him at a moment when he conceived no soul was stirring he droppedhis portmanteau over the banisters which fell demolishing in its wayan elegant grecian patent lamp with glass shades drops c into thepassage below with a hideous crash while the cry of murder thievesmurder was repeated by many voices and rendered him almost immoveablein the next moment the butler the cook the groom and indeed everyperson in the house appeared on the staircase some almost in a stateof nudity and shrinking from each other's gaze and all armed withsuch weapons as chance had thrown in their way to attack the supposeddepredatoramong the rest fortunately for tallyhoho who stood balancing himselfagainst the banisters in a state of indecision whether he should ascendor descend tom dashall in his nightgown burst out of his room in alarmat the noise with a brace of pistols one in his hand in the very actof cocking it and the other placed in convenient readiness under hisleft arm why what the devil is the matter vociferated he and atthat moment his eye caught the agitated figure of his cousin bob on thehalflanding place below him at the sound of his wellknown voice theinnocent and unsuspecting cause of this confusion and alarm looked upat his friend as if half afraid and half ashamed of the occurrence andstammered out where is the thief who is murdered i'll swear thereis something broke somewhere tell me which way to go tom lookedaround him at the group of halfclad nymphs and swains who were nowhuddling together conceiving their security lay in combination andfinding all eyes were placed with astonishment and wonder on bob beganto see through what had happened and burst into an immoderate fit oflaughter which relieved the frightened damsels but so confounded poortallyhoho that he scarcely knew whether he was standing on his head orhis heels why said tom addressing himself to his cousin you willget yourself murdered if you go wandering about people's houses at thedead of the night in this manner are you asleep or awake who have youmade an assignation with or where are you going to what are youup to master bobby eh these tricks won't do hereisn't love's unhallow'd flame invites to roamand bids you from your pillow creepor say why thus disturb my peaceful homelike macbeth who doth murder sleeptallyhoho was unable to reply he looked down over the banister he lookedup at the risible features of tom dashall who was almost bursting atthe ludicrous situation in which he found his friend and his servantscome said tom there are no thieves all's right to theservants you may quiet your minds and go to business bob i'll bedown with you presently upon this the staircase was cleared in aninstant of all but the unfortunate tallyhoho and peace appeared tobe restored in the family but not to bob's mind conceiving he hadcommitted a gross violation of good breeding and shewn but a badspecimen of his aptitude to become a learner of london manners it mustbe confessed it was rather an awkward commencement however in a fewminutes recovering himself from the fright he crawled gently down thestairs and took a survey of the devastation he had made cursed thelamp d d the portmanteau then snatching it from the ruin beforehim and

fancycoloured cloths and measurestaken accordingly during which time tom as on the former occasioncontinued his enquiries relative to the occurrences in the fashionableworldrather tame sir at present the queen's unexpected visit to the twotheatres was for a time a matter of surprise the backwardness of drurylane managers to produce god save the king has been construed intodisloyalty to the sovereign and a laughable circumstance took place onhis going to the same house a few nights back which has already beenmade the subject of much merriment both in conversation and caricatureit appears that mr gloss'em who is a shining character in thetheatrical world at least among the minors of the metropolis and whosefather was for many years a waxchandler in the neighbourhood of sohoholds a situation as clerk of the cheque to the gentlemen pensionersof his majesty's household as well as that of major domo manager andproprietor of a certain theatre not half a mile from waterloo bridgea part of his duty in the former capacity is to attend occasionallyupon the person of the king as one of the appendages of royalty inwhich character he appeared on the night in question the servantsof the attendants who were in waiting for their masters had a roomappropriated to their use one of these latter gentry no other thangloss'em's servant being anxious to have as near a view of the sacredperson of his majesty as his employer had placed himself in a goodsituation at the door in order to witness his departure when a mrwinpebble of mismanaging notoriety and also a ponderous puff assumingmanagerial authority espying him desired the policeofficers andguards in attendance to turn out the lamplighter's boy pointing togloss'em's servant this it seems was no sooner said than done at thepoint of the bayonet some little scuffle ensued his majesty and suitedeparted hold up your arm sirbut did the matter end there enquired dashallo dear no not exactlybecause if it did continued tom in my opinion it began with a waxtaper and ended in the smoke of a farthing rush light you have made itappear to be a gasreceiver without suppliesi beg pardon said mr w the pipes are full but the gas is not yetturned onthis created a laugh and mr w proceededthe next day the servant having informed his master of the treatmenthe had received a gentleman was dispatched from gloss'em to winpebbleto demand an apology which being refused the former with a largehorsewhip under his arm accosted the latter and handsomely belabouredhis shoulders with lusty stripes that you see sir sets the gas allin a blaze that will do sir now sir at your service addressinghimself to tallyhohoyes said tom the taper's alight again now and pray what was theconsequencewinpebble called for assistance which was soon obtained and away theywent to bowstreet manager taper and manager vapour the one blazingwith fire and the other exhausted with thrashing twas a laughingscene manager struts and manager butt

amusement trulysaid tom and of course produced with new scenery music dresses anddecorations forming a combination of attractions superior to any everexhibited at any theatre egad it would make a most excellent scene inanew pantomimeha ha ha said mr w true sir true and the duel of lordshampetre would have also its due portion of effect but as hislordship is a good customer of mine you must excuse any remarks on thatcircumstancewe have already heard of his lordship's undaunted courage and firmnessas well as the correctness of his aimhe he he chuckled w then i fancy your information is not verycorrect for it appears his lordship displayed a want of every one ofthose qualities that you impute to him however i venture to hope nounpleasant measures will result from the occurrence as i made the verypantaloons he wore upon the occasion it seems he is considerably cutup but you must know that previous to the duel i was consultedupon the best mode of securing his sacred person from the effects of abullet i recommended a very high waistband lined with whalebone andwell padded with horsehair to serve as a breastplate and calculatedat once to produce warmth and resist penetration the pantaloonswere accordingly made thickly overlaid with extremely rich andexpensive gold lace and considered to be stiff enough for anythingaye even to keep his lordship erect but what do you suppose wasthe effect of all my care i should not like to make a common talkof it but so it certainly was his lordship had no objection to thewhalebone buckram c outside of him but was fearful that if hisantagonist's fire should be welldirected his tender body might beadditionally hurt by the splinters of the whalebone being carried alongwith it and actually proposed to take them off before the dreadful hourof appointment came on in this however he was fortunately overruled byhis second who by the by was but a goose in the affair and managedit altogether very badly except in the instance of being prompt withthe smellingbottle which certainly was welltimed and it would havebeen a hissing hot business but for the judicious interference of theother seconda loud laugh succeeded this additional piece of information relativeto the affair of honour and snip having finished his measurementcolours were fixed upon and he departed promising to be punctual inthe delivery of the new habiliments on the next dayi am now convinced said bob of the great importance and utility ofa london tradesman and the speed of their execution is wonderfulyes replied tom it is only to be equalled by the avidity with whichthey obtain information and the rapidity with which they circulateit why in another half hour your personal appearance the cut ofyour country coat your complexion and character as far as so shortan interview would allow for obtaining it will be known to all hiscustomers they are generally quick and acute discerners but comewe must be making ready for our walk it is now halfpast teno'clock sparkle will be here presently it is time to be dressing as imean to have a complete ramble during the day take a chop somewhereon the road and in the evening my boy we'll take a peep into thetheatre lord byron's tragedy of marino falter is to be performedtonight and i can i think promise you a treat of the highest kindtallyhoho who had no idea of dressing again having already been obligedto dress twice seemed a little surprised at the proposition butsupposing it to be the custom of london nodded assent andproceeded to the dressingroom as he walked up stairs he could not helpcasting his visual orbs over the banisters just to take a bird's eyeview of the scene of his morning disasters of which to his greatastonishment and surprise not a vestige remained a new lamp had beenprocured which seemed to have arisen like a phoenix from its ashes andthe stone passage and stairs appeared as he termed it as white as acauliflower at the sight of all this he was gratified and delightedfor he expected to find a heap of ruins to reproach him he skipped orrather vaulted up the stairs three or four at a stride with all thegaiety of a racehorse when first brought to the startingpost therapid movements of a life in london at once astonished and enrapturedhim nor did he delay his steps or his delight until he had reachedthe topmost story when bursting open the door lie marched boldly intothe room here again he was at fault a female shriek assailed his earwhich stopped his course and looking around him he could not find fromwhence the voice proceeded good god continued the same voice whatcan be the meaning of this intrusion begone rash man in the meantimetom who was in a room just under the one into which he hadunfortunately made so sudden an entrance appeared at the doorwhat the devil is the matter now said tom when spying his cousinin the centre of the room without seeming to know whether to return orremain he could not restrain his laughter tallyhoho looked up like onein a dream then down then casting his eyes around him he perceivedin the corner peeping out from the bedcurtains in which she hadendeavoured to hide her almost naked person the head of the oldhousekeeper the picture was moving and at the same time laughablethe confusion of bob the fright of the housekeeper and the laughter oftom were subjects for the pencil of a hogarthso said tom you are for springing game in all parts of the houseand at all times too how came you here not by my appointment sirreplied the old lady who still remained rolled up in the curtain inever did such a thing in all my born days i'm an honest woman andmean to remain so i never was so ashamed in all my lifei believe the house is enchanted cried bob d me i neverseem to step without being on a barrel of gunpowder ready to ignitewith the touch of my foot i have made some cursed blunder again anddon't seem to know where i amcome come said dashall that won't do i'm sure you had some designupon my housekeeper who you hear by her own account is a good womanand won't listen to your advancesby this time the servants had arrived at the door and were alternatelypeeping in wondering to see the two gentlemen in such a situation andsecretly giggling and enjoying the embarrassment of the old womanwhose wig lay on the table and who was displaying her bald pate andshrivelled features from the bedcurtains enveloped in fringe andtassels which only served to render them still more ludicrousbob affected to laugh said it was very odd he could not account forit at all stammered out something like an apology begg'd pardon itwas a mistake he really took it for his own room he never wasso bewildered in his life was very sorry he should cause so muchalarm but really had no sort of intention whateverwell said dashall the best reparation you can now make for yourintrusion is a speedy retreat time is escaping so come along andtaking him by the arm they walked down the stairs together and thenproceeded to refit without further obstruction in order to be readyfor sparkle who was expected every minutethe first day of bob's residence in london had already been productiveof some curious adventures in which he unfortunately as he consideredhad sustained the principal character a character not altogethersuitable to is inclinations or wishes though productive of muchmerriment to his ever gay and sprightly cousin who had witnessed theembarrassment of his pupil upon his first entrance into life withungovernable laughter it was to him excellent sport while it furnisheda good subject of speculation and conversation among the servants belowbut was not so well relished by the affrighted old housekeeper indeedthe abrupt entrance of a man into her bedchamber had so deranged herideas that she was longer than usual in decking her person previous toher reappearance the tender frame of the old lady had beensubjected to serious agitations at the bare idea of such a visit andthe probable imputations that might in consequence be thrown upon hersacred and unspotted character nor could she for some time recover herusual serenitysuch was the situation of the parties at the moment we are nowdescribing but as our heroes are preparing for an extensive actualsurvey of men manners and tidings we shall for the present leave themin peace and quietness while we proceed to the next chapterchapter viiwhat shows and what sights what a round of delightsyou'll meet in the gay scene of londonhow charming to view amusements still newtwenty others you'll find soon as one's doneat the gay scene at court peers and gentry resortin pleasure you'll never miss one daythere's the opera treat the parade in bond streetand the crowd in hyde park on a sundaytom whose wardrobe was extensive found no difficulty and lost notime in preparing for the promenade while on the other hand tallyhohowas perplexed to know how to tog himself out in a way suitable tomake his appearance in the gay world of fashion dashall had thereforerapidly equipped himself when perceiving it was halfpast elevenhe was the more perplexed to account for the absence of sparkle foralthough it was an early hour yet upon such an occasion as that ofinitiating a new recruit it was very extraordinary that he should nothave been prompt however he entered tallyhoho's room and found himlooking out of the window in a posture of rumination probably revolvingin his mind the events of the morningcome said tom as he entered tis time to be on the move and ifsparkle don't show in a few minutes we'll set sail and call in upon himat long's in bond street perhaps he is not well or something preventshis appearance we'll make it in our way and we have a fine day beforeusi am at your service replied bob who could not help viewing theelegance of his cousin's appearance the style of his dress and theneatness with which his garments fitted him were all subjects ofadmiration and formed so strong a contrast with his own as almostto excite envy he had however attired himself in a way that befits afashionable country gentleman a green coat white waistcoat buckskinbreeches and boots over which a pair of leggings appeared whichextended below the calf of the leg and half up the thigh surmountedwith a lily shallow such was the costume in which he was destined toshow off and thus equipped after a few minutes they emerged from thehouse in piccadilly on the proposed ramble and proceeded towards bondstreetthe first object that took their particular attention was the burlingtonarcade come said tom we may as well go this way and immediatelythey passed the man in the goldlaced hat who guards the entrance toprevent the admission of boys and improper persons the display of theshops with the sun shining through the windows above afforded much forobservation and attracted bob from side to side to look to wonder andadmire but tom who was intent upon finding his friend sparkle urgedthe necessity of moving onward with more celerity lest he should begoneout and consequently kept drawing his cousin forward another anda better opportunity will be afforded for explanation than the presentand as speed is the order of the day i hope you will not provedisorderly we shall soon reach long's and when we have sparkle withus we have one of the most intelligent and entertaining fellows inthe world he is a sort of index to every thing and every body hisknowledge of life and character together with a facetiousness ofwhim and manner which he has in delineating them are what we callin london prime and bang up to the mark there is scarcely a lanecourt alley or street in the metropolis but what he knows from theremotest corners of ragfair to the open and elegant squares of thewest even to hyde park corner memory mirth and magic seem at alltimes to animate his tongue and as the song sayshe is the hoy for bewitching emwhether goodhumour'd or coyindeed he is the admiration of all who know him wit whim frolicand fun are constant companions with him and i really believe in adungeon or a palace he would always appear the sameby this time they had reached bond street in their way to whicheach step they had taken the streets and avenues of every descriptionappeared to bob to be crowded to an excess the mingling cries whichwere vociferated around them produced in his mind uncommonsensations the rattling of the carriages the brilliance of the shopsand the continual hum of the passengers contributed to heighten thescenebond street said dashall is not one of the most elegant streetsin the vicinity of london but is the resort of the most fashionablepeople and from about two o'clock till five it is all bustle alllife every species of fashionable vehicle is to be seen dashingalong in gay and gallant pride from two to five are the fashionableshoppinghours for which purpose the first families resort to thiswellknown street others to shew their equipage make an assignationor kill a little time which is as much a business with some as is themore careful endeavours of others to seize him in his flight and makethe most of his presence the throng is already increasing the varietyrichness and gaiety of the shops in this street will always beattractive and make it a popular rendezvous of both sexes it willshortly be as crowded as rag fair or the royal exchange and the magicsplendour has very peculiar propertiesit makes the tradesman forget while he is cheating a lovely andsmiling duchess that in all probability her ladyship is endeavouring tocheat him it makes the gay and airy the furrowed and painted lady ofthe town forget that she must pay a visit to her uncle in orderto raise the wind before she can make her appearance at the theatreat halfprice it makes the dashing prisoner forget that while heis sporting his figure in the bangup style of appearance he is onlytaking his ride on a dayrule from the king's bench it makes the lordwho drives fourinhand forget his losses of the night before at some ofthe fashionable gaminghouses it makes one adventurer forget that theclothes in which he expects to obtain respect and attention are morethan likely to be paid for in newgate another for a time forgets thatjohn doe and richard roe have expelled him from his my uncle is a very convenient and accommodating sort offriend who lives at the sign of the three balls indicativeof his willingness to lend money upon good security for thepayment of enormous interest the original meaning of thesign has puzzled the curious and antiquarians and the onlyprobable meaning they can discover is that it implies thechances are two to one against any property being redeemedafter being once committed to the keeping of this tenderheartedand affectionate relativelodgings and a third that all his worldly possessions are not equalto the purchase of a dinner it is an ignis fatuus a sort of magiclantern replete with delusive appearances of momentary duration anescape to the regions of noise tumult vanity and frivolity where therealities of life the circumstances and the situation of the observerare not suffered to intrudebut to be seen in this street at a certain hour is one of theessentials to the existence of hautton it is the point of attractionfor greetings in splendid equipages from the haughty bend or familiarnod of arrogance to the humble bow of servility here mimicry withoutmoney assumes the consequential air of independence while modest meritcreeps along unheeded through the glittering crowd here all the sensesare tantalized with profusion and the eye is dazzled with temptationfor no other reason than because it is the constant business of afashionable life not to live in but out of self to imitate theluxuries of the affluent without a tithe of their income and tosacrifice morality at the altar of notorietyyour description of this celebrated street of which i have heard somuch said tallyhoho is truly livelybut it is strictly true continued tomthey had now arrived at long's and found a barouche and four waiting atthe door upon entering the first person they met was lord cripplegatewhom they passed and proceeded to the coffeeroom in one of theboxes of which tom immediately directed his cousin's attention to awelldressed young man who was reading the newspaper and sipping hiscoffee take notice of him said tombob looked at him for a moment marked his features and his dresswhich was in the extreme of fashion while tom turning to one of thewaiters enquired for his friend sparklehe has not been here since yesterday morning said the waiteri have been waiting for him these two hours exclaimed the young sprigof fashion laying down the newspaper almost at the same moment andmust wait till he comes ah mr dashall how d'ye dovery glad tosee you left all well in the country i hope mr sparkle was to havemet me this morning at eleven precisely i should judge he is gone intothe countryit must have been late last night then said dashall for heleft us about halfpast ten and promised also to meet us again thismorning at eleven i can't think what can have become of him but comesaid he taking bob by the arm we must keep moving good morning goodmorning and thus saying walked directly out of the house turning tothe right again towards piccadillythere is a remark made i think by goldsmith said tom that one halfof the world don't know how the other half lives and the man i spoke toin the coffeeroom whose name i am unacquainted with though his personis recognized by almost every body while his true character residenceand means of subsistence remain completely in obscurity from what ihave seen of him i judge is what may be termed a hanger on a hanger on said bob what can that mean i took him for a man ofproperty and high birth but i saw you take so little notice of himah my good fellow i have already cautioned you not to be duped byappearances a hanger on is a sort of sycophant or toadeaterand in the coffeehouses and hotels of london many such are to befound men who can spin out a long yarn tell a tough story andtip you a rum chant who invite themselves by a freedom of addressbordering on impudence to the tables and the parties of persons theyknow by pretending to call in by mere accident just at the appointedtime by assuming great confidence great haste little appetite andmuch business but at the same time requiring but little pressure toforego them all for the pleasure of the company present what hecan have to do with sparkle i am at a loss to conceive but he is aninsinuating and an intriguing sort of fellow whom i by no means likeso i cut himbob did not exactly understand the meaning of the word cut andtherefore begged his cousin to explainthe cut said tom is a fashionable word for getting rid by rudeor any means of any person whose company is not agreeable the art ofcutting is reduced to a system in london and an explanatory treatisehas been written on the subject for the edification of the nativesbut i am so bewildered to think what can have detained sparkle anddeprived us of his company that i scarcely know how to think for amoment on any other subject at present vide a small volume entitled the cutterit is somewhat strange cried bob that he was not with you thismorningthere is some mystery in it said tom which time alone can unravelbut however we will not be deprived of our intended ramble at thismoment they entered piccadilly and were crossing the road in their wayto st james's street when dashall nodded to a gentleman passing by onthe opposite side and received a sort of half bow in return thatsaid tom is a curious fellow and a devilish clever fellow too foralthough he has but one arm he is a man of sciencein what way enquired bobhe is a pugilist said tom one of those courageous gentlemen who canqueer the daylight tap the claret prevent telling fibs and pop thenoddle into chancery and a devilish good hand he is i can assure youamong those whocan combat with ferocious strifeand beat an eye out or thump out a lifecan bang the ribs in or bruise out the brainsand die like noble blockheads for their painsillustration pages fives courthaving but one arm of course he is unable to figure in thering though he attends the mills and is a constant visitor at thefives court exhibitions and generally appears a la beecher he prideshimself upon flooring a novice and hits devilish hard with the glove ihave had some lessons from this amateur of the old english science andfelt the force of his fist but it is a very customary thing to commencein a friendly way till the knowing one finds an opportunity which hecannot resist of shewing the superiority he possesses so it was withharry and me when he put on his glove i use the singular numberbecause he has but one hand whereon to place a glove withal come saidhe it shall only be a little innocent spar i also put on a glovefor it would not be fair to attack a onearmed man with two and no oneought to take the odds in combat to it we went and i shewed firstblood for he tapped the claret in no timeneat milling we had what with clouts on the nob home hits inthe breadbasket clicks in the gob and plumps in the daylight aprettier treat between two johnny raws tis not easy to meeti profited however by harry's lessons and after a short time wasenabled to return the compliment with interest by sewing up one of hisglimmers this is st james's street continued he as they turned the cornerrather short in doing which somewhat animated by the description hehad just been giving tom's foot caught the toe of a gentleman whowas mincing along the pathway with all the care and precision of adancingmaster which had the effect of bringing him to the ground in aninstant as effectually as a blow from one of the fancy tom who hadno intention of giving offence wantonly apologized for the misfortuneby i beg pardon sir while bob who perceived the poor creature wasunable to rise again and apprehending some broken bones assisted himto regain his erect position the poor animal or nondescript ycleptdandy however had only been prevented the exercise of its limbs by thestiffness of certain appendages without which its person could not becomplete the stays lined with whalebone were the obstacles to itsrising being however placed in its natural position he began in anaffected blustering tone of voice to complain that it was d d odda gentleman could not walk along the streets without being incommodedby puppies pulled out his quizzing glass and surveyed our heroes fromhead to foot then taking from his pocket a smelling bottle which byapplication to the nose appeared to revive him tom declared he wassorry for the accident had no intention and hoped he was not hurtthis however did not appear to satisfy the offended dandy who turnedupon his heel muttering to himself the necessity there was of preventingdrunken fellows from rambling the streets to the annoyance of sober andgenteel people in the daytimedashall who overheard the substance of his ejaculation broke from thearm of bob and stepping after him without ceremony by a sudden wheelplaced himself in the front of him so as to impede his progress asecond time a circumstance which filled mr fribble with additionalalarm and his agitation became visibly depicted on his countenancewhat do you mean cried dashall with indignation taking theimputation of drunkenness at that early hour in dudgeon who andwhat are you sir explain instantly or by the honour of agentleman i'll chastise this insolence what are you is a formidable question to a dandy of thepresent day fordandy's a gender of the doubtful kinda something nothing not to be definedtwould puzzle worlds its sex to ascertainso very empty and so very vainit is a fact that the following examination of three ofthese nondescripts took place at bow street a very shorttime back in consequence of a nocturnal fracas the reportwas thus giventhree young sprigs of fashion in full dress somewhatdamaged and discoloured by a night's lodging in the cell ofa watchhouse were yesterday brought before mr birniecharged with disorderly conduct in the streets and withbeating a watchman named lloydlloyd stated that his beat was near the piazza and at avery late hour on thursday night the three defendants camethrough covent garden singing and conducting themselves inthe most riotous manner possible they were running andwere followed by three others all in a most uproariousstate of intoxication and he thought proper to stop themupon which he was floored sanceremonie and when herecovered his legs he was again struck and called a b ycharley and other ungenteel names he called forthe assistance of some of his brethren and the defendantswere with some trouble taken to the watchhouse they werevery jolly on the way and when lodged in durance amusedthemselves with abusing the constable of the night and tookespecial care that no one within hearing of the watchhouseshould get a wink of sleep for the remainder of the nightmr birnie well young gentleman what have you to say tothis the one who undertook to be spokesman threw himselfin the most familiar manner possible across the table andhaving fixed himself perfectly at his ease he said thefact was they had been dining at a tavern and were ratherdrunk and on their way through the piazza they endeavouredby running away to give the slip to their three companionswho were still worse than themselves the others howevercalled out stop thief and the watchman stopped themwhereat they naturally felt irritated and certainly gavethe watchman a bit of a thrashingmr birnie how was he to know you were not the thieveshe did quite right to stop you and i am very glad he hasbrought you here pray sir what are you defendant iam nothing sir mr birnie to another and what areyou defendant why sir i am i am sir nothing mrbirnie well this is very fine pray sir turning tothe third who stood twirling his hat will you do me thefavour to tell what you arethis gentleman answered in the same way i am as myfriends observed nothingmr birnie well gentlemen i must endeavour to makesomething of you here gaoler let them he locked up and ishall not part with them until i have some better account oftheir occupationswe have heard it asserted that nine tailors make a man howmany dandies professing to be nothing may be required toaccomplish the proposed intention of making something mayperhaps by this time be discovered by the worthymagistrate we however suspect he has had severe work of itleave me alone exclaimed the almost petrified dandynot till you have given me the satisfaction i have a right to demandcried tom i insist upon an explanation and apology or demand yourcard who are you sir that's my address instantly handing him acard i am not to be played with nor will i suffer your escape afterthe insulting manner in which you have spoken with impunitythough not prepared for such a rencontre the dandy who now perceivedthe inflexible temper of tom's mind and a crowd of people gatheringround him determined at least to put on as much of the character of aman as possible and fumbled in his pocket for a card at length findingone he slipped it into tom's hand oh sir said he if that's thecase i'm your man demise how when or where you please ponhonor then beckoning to a hackney coach he hobbled to the doorand was pushed in by coaches who immediately mounted the box andflourishing his whip soon rescued him from his perilous situation andthe jeers of the surrounding multitudetom who in the bustle of the crowd had slipped the card of hisantagonist into his pocket now took bob's arm and they pursued theirway down st james's street and could not help laughing at the affairbut tallyhoho who had a great aversion to duelling and was thinking ofthe consequences bit his lips and expressed his sorrow at whathad occurred he ascribed the hasty imputation of drunkenness to theirritating effects of the poor creature's accident and expressed hishope that his cousin would take no further notice of it tom howeveron the other hand ridiculed bob's fears told him it was a pointof honour not to suffer an insult in the street from any man nor wouldhe besides the charge of drunkenness from such a thing as that is notto be borne d n it man drunkenness in the early part of the dayis a thing i abhor it is at all times what i would avoid if possiblebut at night there may be many apologies for it nay in some cases evento avoid it is impossible the pleasures of society are enhancedby it the joys of love are increased by the circulation of theglass harmony conviviality and friendship are produced by it though iam no advocate for inebriety and detest the idea of the beastwho clouds his reason by the light of dayand falls to drink an early and an easy preywell said bob i cannot help thinking this poor fellow who hasalready betrayed his fears will be inclined to make any apology for hisrudeness tomorrowif he does not said tom i'll wing him to a certainty ajackanapes a puppy a manmilliner perhaps a thing of shreds andpatches he shall not go unpunished i promise you so come along wewill just step in here and i'll dispatch this business at once i'llwrite a challenge and then it will be off my hands and so sayingthey entered a coffeehouse where calling for pen ink and paper tomimmediately began his epistle shrewdly hinting to his cousin that heexpected he would act as his second it will be a fine opportunity forintroducing your name to the gay world the newspapers will record yourname as a man of ton let us see now how it will appear on lastthe honourable tom dashall attended by his cousin robert tallyhoho esqof belleville hall met ah by the bye let us see who he is here hefelt in his pocket for the cardbob however declared his wish to decline obtaining popularity by beingpresent upon such an occasion and suggested the idea of his callingupon the offender and endeavouring to effect an amicable arrangementbetween themhallo exclaimed tom with surprise as he drew the card from hispocket and threw it on the table ha ha ha look at thattallyhoho looked at the card without understanding it what does itmean said hemean replied tom why it is a pawnbroker's duplicate for ahunting watch deposited with his uncle this morning in st martin'slane for two pounds laughable enough well you may dismiss your fearsfor the present but i'll try if i can't find my man by this means ifhe is worth finding at all events we have found a watchbob now joined in the laugh and having satisfied the waiter theysallied forth againjust as they left the coffeehouse do you see that gentleman in theblue great coat arm in arm with another that is no other than theyou would scarcely conceive by his present appearance thathe has commanded armies and led them on to victory and that havingretired under the shade of his laurels he is withering them awayleaf by leaf by attendance at the hells of the metropolis hisunconquerable spirit still actuating him in his hours of relaxation itis said that the immense sum awarded to him for his prowess in warhas been so materially reduced by his inordinate passion for play thatalthough he appears at court and is a favourite the demon povertystares him in the face but this is a vile world and half one hears isnot to be believed he is certainly extravagant fond of women and fondof wine but all these foibles are overshadowed with so much glory asscarcely to remain perceptible here is the palace said tom directinghis cousin's attention to the bottom of the streetbob was evidently struck at this piece of information as he coulddiscover no mark of grandeur in its appearance to entitle it to thedignity of a royal residenceit is true said tom the outside appearance is not much in itsfavour but it is venerable for its antiquity and for its being tilllately the place at which the kings of this happy island have held theircourts on the site of that palace originally stood an hospitalfounded before the conquest for fourteen leprous females to whom eightbrethren were afterwards added to assist in the performance of divineservicevery necessary said bob and yet scarcely sufficient hells the abode or resort of blacklegs or gamblerswhere they assemble to commit their depredations on theunwary but of these we shall have occasion to enlargeelsewhereyou seem to quiz this palace and are inclined to indulge your witupon old age in it was surrendered to henry viii and he erectedthe present palace and enclosed st james's park to serve as a placeof amusement and exercise both to this palace and whitehall but itdoes not appear to have been the court of the english sovereigns duringtheir residence in town till the reign of queen ann from which time ithas been uniformly used as suchit is built of brick and that part which contains the stateapartments being only one story high gives it a regular appearanceoutside the staterooms are commodious and handsome although there isnothing very superb or grand in the decorations or furniturethe entrance to these rooms is by a staircase which opens into theprincipal court which you now see at the top of the staircase aretwo rooms one on the left called the queen's and the other the king'sguardroom leading to the stateapartments immediately beyond theking's guardroom is the presencechamber which contains a canopyand is hung with tapestry and which is now used as a passage to theprincipal roomsthere is a suite of five rooms opening into each other successivelyfronting the park the presencechamber opens into the centre roomwhich is denominated the privychamber in which is a canopy offloweredcrimson velvet generally made use of for the king to receivethe quakerson the right are two drawingrooms one within the other at the upperend of the further one is a throne with a splendid canopy on which thekings have been accustomed to receive certain addresses this is calledthe grand drawingroom and is used by the king and queen on certainstate occasions the nearer room being appropriated as a kind ofantechamber in which the nobility c are permitted to remain whiletheir majesties are present in the further room and is furnished withstools sofas c for the purpose there are two leveerooms on theleft of the privychamber on entering from the king's guardroom andpresencechamber the nearer one serving as an antechamber to theother they were all of them formerly meanly furnished but at thetime of the marriage of our present king they were elegantly fittedup the walls are now covered with tapestry very beautiful and of richcolours tapestry which although it was made for charles ii hadnever been used having by some accident lain unnoticed in a chest tillit was discovered a short time before the marriage of the princethe canopy of the throne was made for the latequeen's birthday thefirst which happened after the union of great britain and ireland itis made of crimson velvet with very broad gold lace embroidered withcrowns set with fine and rich pearls the shamrock emblematical of theirish nation forms a part of the decorations of the british crown andis executed with great taste and accuracythe grand drawingroom contains a large magnificent chandelier ofsilver gilt but i believe it has not been lighted for some years andin the grand leveeroom is a very noble bed the furniture of which isof spitalfields manufacture in crimson velvet it was first put up withthe tapestry on the marriage of the present king then prince of walesit is upon the whole an irregular building chiefly consisting ofseveral courts and alleys which lead into the park this however isthe age of improvement and it is said that the palace will shortlybe pulled down and in the front of st james's street a magnificenttriumphal arch is to be erected to commemorate the glorious victoriesof the late war and to form a grand entrance to the parkthe duke of york the duke of clarence the king's servants and manyother dignified persons live in the stableyardin the stableyard said bob dignified persons reside in astableyard you astonish meit is quite true said tom and remember it is the stableyard of akingi forgot that circumstance said bob and that circumstances altercases but whose carriage is this driving with so much rapiditythat is his highness the duke of york most likely going to pay a visitto his royal brother the king who resides in a palace a little furtheron which will be in our way for it is yet too early to see much inthe park so let us proceed i am anxious to make some inquiry aboutmy antagonist and therefore mean to take st martin's lane as we goalongwith this they pursued their way along pall mall the rapidity of tom'smovements however afforded little opportunity for observation or remarktill they arrived opposite carlton house when he called hiscousin's attention to the elegance of the new streets opposite to itthat said he is waterloo place which as well as the memorablebattle after which it is named has already cost the nation an immensesum of money and must cost much more before the proposed improvementsare completed it is however the most elegant street in london thewant of uniformity of the buildings has a striking effect and gives itthe appearance of a number of palaces in the time of queen elizabeththere were no such places as pall mall st james'sstreet piccadillynor any of the streets or fine squares in this part of the town thatbuilding at the farther end is now the british fireoffice and has apleasing effect at this distance the cupola on the left belongs to achapel the interior of which for elegant simplicity is unrivalled tothe left of the centre building is a circus and a serpentine streetnot yet finished which runs to swallow street and thence directlyto oxford road where another circus is forming and is intended tocommunicate with portland place by which means a line of streetcomposed of all new buildings will be completed of this dull lookingplace turning to carlton house although it is the townresidenceof our king i shall say nothing at present as i intend devoting amorning along with you to its inspection the exterior has not themost lively appearance but the interior is magnificent during thisconversation they had kept moving gently onillustration pages the kings leveebob was charmed with the view down waterloo placethat said his cousin pointing to the arcade at the opposite cornerof pall mall is the italian operahouse which has recently assumedits present superb appearance and may be ranked among the finestbuildings in london it is devoted to the performance of italian operasand french ballets is generally open from december to july andis attended by the most distinguished and fashionable persons theimprovements in this part are great that church which you see in thedistance over the tops of the houses is st martin's in the fieldsin the fields inquired bob what then are we come to the end of thetownha ha ha cried tom the end no no i was going to saythere is no

this piece of advice however cametoo late for his blue bird's eye wipe l had taken flightwhat said bob is this done in open day are you all right andtight elsewhere said tom if you are toddle on and say nothing aboutit open day continued he aye the system of rigging blue bird's eye wipe a blue pocket handkerchief withwhite spots a cant term for all sorts of thieving the life of thecelebrated

believeshe did not leave ten untried in london for he made a pointof commencing early every day and went regularly throughit taking both sides of the way his practice on entering ashop was to request

atthe bar the length of time that had elapsed since our last meeting wassufficient inducement for us to crack a bottle together so takinghis arm we proceeded to the place of destination where we sat talkingover past times and indulging our humour till halfpast one o'clockwhen i sallied forth on my return to long's having altogether abandonedmy original intention of calling in goldensquare at the corner ofleicestersquare my ears were assailed with a little of the nightmusic the rattles were in full chorus and the charleys in primetwig were mustering from all quartersillustration pages tom and bob catching a charley nappingthe street was all alive and i made my way through the crowd to theimmediate scene of action which was rendered peculiarly interesting bythe discovery of a dainty bit of female beauty shewing fight with halfa dozen watchmen in order to extricate herself from the grasp of theseguardians of our peace she was evidently under the influence ofthe bacchanalian god which invigorated her arm without impartingdiscretion to her head and she laid about her with such dexterity thatthe old files were fearful of losing their prey but the odds werefearfully against her and never did i feel my indignation more arousedthan when i beheld a sturdy ruffian aim a desperate blow at her headwith his rattle which in all probability had it taken the intendedeffect would have sent her in search of that peace in the other worldof which she was experiencing so little in this it was not possiblefor me to stand by an idle spectator of the destruction of a femalewho appeared to have no defender whatever might be the nature of theoffence alleged or committed i therefore warded off the blow with myleft arm and with my right gave him a wellplanted blow on the conkwhich sent him piping into the kennel in a moment i was surrounded andcharged with a violent assault upon the charley and interfering withthe guardians of the night in the execution of their duty a completediversion took place from the original object of their fury and in thebustle to secure me the unfortunate girl made her escape where to orhow heaven prime twig any thing accomplished in good order or

so here goes by this time we had entered the watchhouse wherei perceived the awful representative of justice seated in an arm chairwith a good blazing fire smoking his pipe in consequential easea crowd of charleys with broken lanterns broken heads and othersymptoms of a row together with several casual spectators had gainedadmittance when jarvis entered declaring by g he wouldn't bechoused by

explainedbut by g i won't put any thing in sam's vay again criedjarvey for my own part as i knew nothing of the occurrencesadverted to i was as much in the dark as if i had gone home withoutinterruption the representations of the charleys proved decisiveagainst me in vain i urged the cause of humanity and the necessityi felt of protecting a defenceless female from the violence ofaccumulating numbers and that i had done no more than every man oughtto have done upon such an occasion old puff and swill the lordof the night declared that i must have acted with maliceaforethought that i was a pal in the concern and that i had beeninstrumental in the design of effecting a rescue and after a veryshort deliberation he concluded that i must be a notorious rascal

i had committeda violent breach of the peace and nothing at that time could beproduced that would prove satisfactory under these circumstances andpartly induced by a desire to avoid being troublesome in other quartersi submitted to a restraint which it appeared i could not very wellavoid and taking my seat in an armchair by the fireside i soon fellfast asleep from which i was only aroused by the occasional entrancesand exits of the guardians until between four and five o'clock whena sort of general muster of the charleys took place and each onedepositing his nightly paraphernalia proceeded to his own habitationfinding the liberation of others from their duties would not have theeffect of emancipating me from my confinement which was likely tobe prolonged to eleven or perhaps twelve o'clock i began to feelmy situation as a truly uncomfortable one when i was informed by thewatchhouse keeper who resides upon the spot that he was going toturn in that there was fire enough to last till his wife turn'dout which would be about six o'clock and as i had the appearance of agentleman if there was any thing i wanted she would endeavour to makeherself useful in obtaining it but lord said he there is no suchthing as believing any body nowadays there was such sets out andsuch manoeuvring that nobody knew nothing of nobodyi am obliged to you my friend said i for this piece ofinformation and in order that you may understand something of theperson you are speaking to beyond the mere exterior view here ishalfacrown for your communicationwhy sir said he laying on at the same moment a shovel

a few nights ago we had em stowed hereas thick as three in a bed we had em all upon the hop you neversee'd such fun in all your life and this here place was as full ofcuriosities as peacock's at exeter change or barleyfair show em uphere all alive alive oindeed said i feeling a little inquisitive on the subject and howdid this happenwhy it was a romish piece of business altogether there was a largeparty of dancing fashionables all met together for a little jig in stmartin's lane and a very pretty medley there was of them the fiddlerswagged their elbows and the lads and lasses their trotters till aboutone o'clock when just as they were in the midst of a quadrille inburst the officers and quickly changed the tune the appearance ofthese gentlemen had an instantaneous effect upon all parties presentthe cause of their visit was explained and the whole squad taken intocustody to give an account of themselves and was brought here inhackneycoaches the delicate miss and her assiduous partner who ashort time before had been all spirits and animation were now sunk ingloomy reflections upon the awkwardness of their situation and many ofour inhabitants would have fainted when they were informed they wouldhave to appear before the magistrate in the morning but for thewelltimed introduction of a little drap of the cratur which an irishlady axed me to fetch for her but the best of the fun was that in thegroup we had a lord and a parson for the dignity of the one and thehonour of the other they were admitted to bail lord have mercy uponus said the parson amen said the lord and this had the desiredeffect upon the constable of the night for he let them off on the slyyou understand but my eyes what work there was in the morning sixteenharvey full of live lumber hop a dancewere taken to bowstreet in a nice pickle you may be suredancingpumps and silkstockings after setting in the watchhouse allnight and surrounded by lots of people that hooted and howled as theprocession passed along in good style they were safely landed at thebrown bear from which they were handed over in groups to be examinedby the magistrate when the men were discharged upon giving satisfactoryaccounts and the women after some questions being put to them you seeall this took place because they were dancing in an unlicensed room itwas altogether a laughable setout as ever you see'd the dandy andthe dandyzettes the exquisite the shorten the ladies maid and theprentice boys my lord and his reverence mingled up higgledypiggledypigs in the straw with bowstreet officers runners andwatchmen ladies squalling and fainting men swearing and almostfighting it would have been a pleasure to have kick'd up a row thatnight a purpose to get admission you would have been highly amusedi'll assure you good morning sir and thus saying he turned the lockupon me and left me to my meditations in about a couple of hoursthe old woman made her appearance and prepared me some coffee and ateleven o'clock came the constable of the night to accompany me beforethe magistrateaware that the circumstances were rather against me and that i had noright to interfere in other persons

onthe left you see the payoffice of the navythe principal thing to attract notice in this edifice is thesolidity and completeness of the workmanship in the masonry and indeedin every other partafter

avisit to the bonassus a peep at st paul's and a chop at dolly'sthis proposition being highly approved of they continued theirwalk along the strand towards temple bar and in a few minutes wereattracted by the appearance of men dressed in the garb of the yeomen ofthe guards who appeared active in the distribution of handbills andsurrounded a house on the front of which appeared a long string of highand distinguished names as patrons and patronesses of the celebratedanimal called the bonassus crossing the road in their approach tothe door tallyhoho could not help admiring the simple elegance of ashopfront belonging to a grocer whose name is peckvery handsome and tasty indeed replied sparkle that combination ofmarble and brass has a light and elegant effect it has no appearance ofbeing laboured at the inhabitant of the house i believe is a foreigneri think an italian but london boasts of some of the most elegant shopsin the world and by this time they entered the opposite

hisform and powers come along said sparkle let us have a look at themost wonderful production of nature only seventeen months old fivefeet ten inches high and one of the most fashionable fellows in themetropolisit should seem so said tallyhoho by the long list of friends andvisitors that are detailed in the commencement of the bill of fareperhaps said tom there are more bon asses than onevery likely continued sparkle but let me tell you the allusion inthis case does not apply for this animal has nothing of the donkeyabout him and makes no noise as you will infer from the followinglines in the billas the bonassus does not roarhis fame is widely knownfor no dumb animal beforehas made such noise in townat this moment the barking of a dog assailed their ears andsuspended the conversation passing onward to the den of the bonassusthey found a darkfeatured gentleman of middling stature with his hairwhiskers and ears so whitened with powder as to form a completecontrast with his complexion and a black silk handkerchief which he woreround his neck holding a large browncoloured dog by the collar inorder to prevent annoyance to the visitorsd n the dog exclaimed he although he is the best temperedcreature in the world he don't seem to like the appearance of thebonassus and espying sparkle ha my dear fellow how are you ihave not seen you for a long whilewhy sir d n ll i am happy to say i never was better in mylife allow me to introduce you to my two friends the hon mr dashalland robert tallyhoho sir d n ll harlequinthe mutual accompaniments of such an introduction having passed amongthem the knight who was upon the moment of departure as they enteredexpressed his approbation of the animal he had been viewing andlugging his puppy by one hand and his cudgel in the other wished thema good morningthere is an eccentric man of title continued sparklei should judge said bob there was a considerable portion ofeccentricity about him by his appearance is he a baroneta baronet replied sparkle no no he is no other than a quackdoctor of all the subjects that afford opportunities for thesatiric pen in the metropolis perhaps there is none moreabundant or prolific than that of quackery dr johnsonobserves that cheats can seldom stand long againstlaughter but if a judgment is really to be formed fromexisting facts it may be supposed that times are somaterially changed since the residence of that able writerin this sublunary sphere that the reverse of the positionmay with greater propriety be asserted for such is theprevailing practice of the present day that according tothe opinion of thousands there is nothing to be donewithout a vast deal more of profession and pretence thanactual power and he who is the best able to bear laughingat is the most likely to realize the hopes he entertains ofobtaining celebrity and of having his labours crowned withsuccess nothing can be more evident than this in themedical profession though there are successful quacks ofall kinds and in all situations to be found in londonthis may truly be called the age of quackery from theabundance of impostors of every kind that prey upon societyand such as cannot or will not think for themselves oughtto be guarded in a publication of this nature against thefraudulent acts of those persons who make it their businessand profit to deteriorate the health morals and amusementsof the public but in the present instance we are speakingof the medical quack only than which perhaps there is nonemore remarkablethe race of bosses brodrums solomon perkins claimantsc is filled by others of equal notoriety and no doubt ofequal utility the cerfs the curries the laments theruspinis the coopers and monroe are all equally entitledto public approbation particularly if we may credit theletters from the various persons who authenticate themiraculous cures they have performed in the most inveteratewe hail almost said the most impossible cases if thosepersons are really in existence and who can doubt it theycertainly have occasion to be thankful for their escapesand we congratulate them for in our estimation quackdoctors seem to consider the human frame merely as a subjectfor experiments which if successful will secure thereputation of the practitioner the acquisition of fame andfortune is in the estimation of these philosophers cheaplypurchased by sacrificing the lives of a few of the vulgarto whom they prescribe gratis and the slavish obedience ofsome patients to the doctor is really astonishing it issaid that a convalescent at bath wrote to his physician inlondon to know whether he might eat sauce with his porkbut we have not been able to discover whether he expected ananswer gratis that would perhaps have been an experimentnot altogether grateful to the doctor's feelingsthe practice of advertising and billing the town has becomeso common that a man scarcely opens a coalshed or apotatoesstall without giving due notice of it in thenewspapers and distributing handbills and frequently withgreat success but our doctors who make no show of theircommodities have no mode of making themselves known withoutit hence the quantity of bills thrust into the hand of thepassenger through the streets of london which divulge thealmost incredible performances of their publishers a highsoundingname such as the chevalier de diamant thechevalier de rushing or the medical board well bored behindand before are perhaps more necessary with a few paperpuffs as palpable hits my lord than either skill orpractice to obtain notice and secure famethe chevalier de claimant who was originally a boxmakerand a man of genius considering boxmaking a plebeianoccupation was for deducing a logical position not exactlyperhaps by fair argument but at all events through theteeth and was determined although he could not like drn mend the apology of his friends at least to givethem an opportunity for plenty of jawwork with thislaudable object in view he obtained a patent for makingartificial teeth of mineral paste and in his advertisementscondescended not to prove their utility as substitutes forthe real teeth when decayed or wanting this was beneathhis notice and would have been a piece of mere plebeianquackery unworthy of his great genius but absolutelyassured the world that his mineral teeth were infinitelysuperior to any production of nature both for masticationand beauty how this was relished we know not but hedeclared and he certainly ought to know that none butsilly and timid persons would hesitate for one moment tohave their teeth drawn and substitute his minerals and itis wonderful to relate that although his charges wereenormous and the operation as may be supposed not themost pleasant yet people could not resist the ingeniouschevalier's fascinating and drawing puffs in consequence ofwhich he soon became possessed of a large surplus ofcapital with which he determined to speculate in the fundsfor this purpose he employed old tom bish the stockbrokerto purchase stock for the amount but owing to a suddenfluctuation in the market a considerable depreciation tookplace between the time of purchase and that of payment acircumstance which made the chevalier grin and show histeeth determining however not to become a victim to thefangs of bulls and bears but rather to dive like a duck hedeclared the bargain was not legal and that he would not bebound by it bish upon this occasion proved a hardmouthedcustomer to the man of teeth and was not a quiet subject tobe drawn but brought an action against the mineral mongerand recovered the debt tom's counsel in stating the caseobserved that the defendant would find the law could bitesharper aud hold tighter than any teeth he could make andso it turned outthe chevalier de r sp ni is another character who has cutno small figure in this line but has recently made hisappearance in the gazette not exactly on so happy anoccasion as such a circumstance would be to his brotherchip dr d n ll now we suppose sir francis thoughperhaps equally entitled to the honour of knighthood thechevalier has for some years looked royalty in the face byresiding opposite carlton house and taken every precautionto let the public know that such an important publiccharacter was there to be found by displaying his name asconspicuously as possible on brass plates c so that thevisitors to carlton house could hardly fail to notice him asthe second greatest character of that great neighbourhoodbut what could induce so great a man to sport his figure inthe gazette is as unaccountable as the means by which heobtained such happy celebrity had it occurred immediatelyafter the war it might have been concluded without muchstretch of imagination that the chevalier who prideshimself on his intimacy with all the great men of the dayhad through the friendship of the duke of wellington madea contract for the teeth and jawbones of all who fell atthe battle of waterloo and that by bringing to market sogreat a stock at one time the article had fallen in valueand left the speculating chevalier so great a loser as tocause his bankruptcy whether such is the real cause or notit is difficult to ascertain what could induce the chevalierto descend from his dealings with the head to dabble withlower commoditiesamong other modes of obtaining notoriety usually resortedto by empiric the chevalier used to job a very genteelcarriage and pair but his management was so excellent thatthe expenses of his equipage were very trifling for as itwas not intended to run but merely to stand at the doorlike a barker at a broker's shop or a directionpost hehad the loan on very moderate terms the jobmaster takinginto account that the wind of the cattle was not likely tobe injured or the wheels rattled to pieces by velocity orsmashed by any violent concussionthe chevalier had a son who unfortunately was not endowedby nature with so much ambition or information as hisfather for frequently when the carriage has been standingat the door he has been seen drinking gin most cordiallywith coaches without once thinking of the evils of exampleor recollecting that he was one of the family papa used tobe very angry on these occasions because as he said itwas letting people know that coaches was only hired as joband not as a family domesticfor the great benefit and advantage of the communitymedical boards have recently been announced in various partsof the metropolis where according to the assertions of theprincipals in their advertisements every disease incidentto human nature is treated by men of skilful practice andamong these truly useful establishments those of drscooper munro and co of charlotte house blacksmiths andwoodstockhouse oxfordroad are not the least conspicuouswho these worthies are it is perhaps difficult toascertain one thing however is certain that sirf s c e d n ll med is announced as treasurertherefore there can be no doubt but that all is fair aboveboardforbrutus is an honourable manso are they all all honourable menand where so much skill derived from experience isexercised it cannot be doubted but great and importantbenefits may result to a liberal and enlightened people ofthe establishment itself we are informed by a friend thathaving occasion to call on the treasurer upon somebusiness the door was opened by a coppercoloured servanta goodlooking young indian not a fuscus hydaspes but aserving man of good appearance who ushered him up stairsand introduced him to the front room on the first floorwhere all was quackery bronze and brass an electricalmachine images pictures and diplomas framed and glazedand a table covered with books and papers in a short timea person of very imposing appearance entered the room withhis hair profusely powdered and his person from his chinto his toes enveloped in a sort of plaid roquelaure whoapologizing for the absence of the doctor began to assurehim of his being in the entire confidence of the board andin all probability would have proceeded to the operation offeeling the pulse in a very short time had not the visitordiscovered in the features of this disciple of aesculapius aperson he had known in former times why good godcried he is that you what have you done with the magiclanternand the lecture on heads am i right or am i infairyland calling him by his name it was in vain tohesitate it was impossible to escape the discovery wascomplete it was plain however that the dealer in magicaldelusions had not altogether given up the art oflegerdemain which perhaps he finds the most profitable ofthe twoof the worthy knight himself and perhaps the coopers andmunro have been consumed by the electrical fluid of theirown board much might be said he is the inventor of a lifepreserverwith which it may be fairly presumed he haseffected valuable services to his country by thepreservation of royalty as a proof of deserving the honourhe has obtained he is patriotic and independent masonicand benevolent a great admirer of fancy horses and fancyladies a curer of incurables and has recently publishedone of the most extraordinary memoirs that has ever beenlaid before the public embellished with two portraitswhich of the two is most interesting must be left to thediscrimination of those who view them it must however beacknowledged that after reading the following extractingratitude is not yet eradicated from our nature sincenotwithstanding he has obtained the dignified appellation ofsir francis the gazette says that in future no improperperson shall be admitted to the honour of knighthood inconsequenceof two surreptitious presentations lately theone an med the other frc surgeons particularly if itwere possible that this gentleman may be one of the personsalluded to for what says the memoirthe utility of sir francis's invention being thus fullyestablished and its ingenuity universally admired itexcited the interest of the first characters among thenobility and an introduction to court was repeatedlyoffered to sir francis on this account after a previouscommunication with one of the royal family and also withthe secretary of state on the th june last he had thehonour of being presented to his majesty who justlyappreciating the merit of the discovery was pleased toconfer upon him the honour of knighthoodthus it is pleasing in the distribution of honours by thehand of the sovereign to mark where they are conferred onreal merit this is the true intention of their origin butit has been too often departed from and they have beengiven where no other title existed than being the friend ofthose who had influence to gain the royal ear from theabove statement it will be seen this honour was conferredon sir francis by his majesty for an invention which hassaved since its discovery the lives of many hundreds andwhich may be considered as having given the original idea tothe similar inventions that have been attempted since thattime its utility and importance we have also seenacknowledged and rewarded by the two leading societies inthis country and perhaps in europe viz the royal humaneand the society of arts the sovereign therefore was onlyrecognizing merit which had been previously established andthe honour of knighthood to the credit of the individualwas conferred by his majesty in the most liberal andhandsome manner without any other influence being used bysir francis than simply preferring the claimthus the subject of knighthood is to be nursed and as thedoctor and the nurse are generally to be recognizedtogether no one can read this part of the memoir withoutexclaiming well done nussey but why not gazetted afterthis liberal and handsome manner of being rewarded or whyan allusion to two surreptitious presentations the names ofwhich two persons so pointedly omitted cannot well bemisunderstood this is but doing things by halves though nosuch an observation can be applied to the proceedings ofcharlottehouse where cooper munro and co being wellexplained means two or three persons viz a black a whiteman and a mahoganycoloured knight a barber by trade anda skinner by company a dealer in mercurial a puff bypractice and an advertiser well versed in all the arts ofhis prototype a practitioner in panegyric the puff directthe puff preliminary the puff collateral the puffcollusive and the puff oblique or puff by implicationwhether this will apply to sir charles this or not isperhaps not so easy to ascertain but as birds of a featherlike to flock together so these medical knights inmisfortune deserve to be noticed in the same columnalthough the one is said to be a shaver and the other aquaker it seems they have both been moved by the samespirit and both follow a good way off the profession ofmedicineamong the various improvements of these improving times forwe are still improving notwithstanding complaint a learnedlittle devil inflated with gas has suggested a plan forthe establishment of a medical assuranceoffice whereperson and property might be insured at so much per annumand the advantages to be derived from such an institutionwould be that instead of the insurance increasing withyears it would grow less and less how many thousandgrateful patients would it relieve annually but we fear itwould be a daily source of sorrow to these knightlymedical and would by them be considered a devilish hardcasebut hush here is other company and i will give you an account of himas we go alongthey now attended the keeper who explained the age height weightspecies size power and propensities of the animal and then departedon their road towards temple bar on passing through which they wereovertaken again by sir francis in a gig drawn by a duncolouredhorse with his puppy between his legs and a servant by his side andimmediately renewed the previous conversationthere he goes again said sparkle and a rare fellow he is tooi should think so said bob he must have quacked to some goodpurpose to obtain the honour of knighthoodnot positively that continued sparkle for to obtain and todeserve are not synonymous and if report say true there is not muchhonour attached to his obtaining itin the modesty of fearful dutyi read as much as from the rattling tongueof saucy and audacious eloquencelove therefore and tonguetied simplicityat least speak most to my capacityand according to my humble conception he who talks much about himselfor pays others to talk or write about him is generally most likely tobe least deserving of public patronage for if a man possesses real andevident abilities in any line of profession the public will not belongin making a discovery of its existence and the bounty as is mostusually the case would quickly follow upon the heels of approbationbut many a meritorious man in the metropolis is pining away hismiserable existence too proud to beg and too honest to steal whileothers with scarcely more brains than a sparrow by persevering inadetermination to leave no stone unturned to make themselves appearridiculous as a first step to popularity and having once excitedattention even though it is merely to be laughed at by the thinkingpart of mankind he finds it no great difficulty to draw the money outof their pockets while their eyes are riveted on a contemplation of hisperson or conduct and there are not wanting instances of effronterythat have elevated men of little or no capacity to dignified situationsif report say true the present secretary of the admiralty who isadmirable for his poetry also was originally a hairdresser residingsomewhere in blackfriar's or westminsterroad but then you mustrecollect he was a man who knew it was useless to lose a singleopportunity and probably such has been the case with sir danielharlequin who from keeping a small shop in tapping making a blazeupon the water about his lifepreserver marrying a wife with a redface and a full pocket retired to a small cottage at mile end andafterwards establishing a medical board has got himself dubbed aknight to be sure he has had a deal of puffing and blowing work to getthrough in his progress which probably accounts for his black looksnot a little increased by the quantity of powder he wears but what havewe here finding the bustle of the streets considerably increased afterpassing temple barsome political bookseller or other in all probability saidtom i'll step forward and see and in passing through the numerousbody of persons that crowded on every side the whole party wasseparated bob who had hung a little back while his two friends rushedforward was lingering near the corner of the temple he was beckoned bya man across the way to whom he immediately wentdo you happen to want a piece of fine india silk handkerchiefs siri have some in my pocket that i can recommend and sell cheap for moneymust be had but only keep it to yourself because they are smuggledgoods of the best quality and richest pattern during this openingspeech he was endeavouring to draw tallyhoho under the archway ofbellyard when sparkle espying him ran across to him and taking himby the arm come along said he and if you don't take yourself offinstantly i'll put you in custody shaking his stick at the otherall this was like hebrew to bob who for his part really conceived thepoor fellow as he termed him might be in want of money and compelledto dispose of his article for subsistenceha ha ha cried sparkle i see you know nothing about them theseare the locusts of the town at this moment they were joined by thehon tom dashallegad continued sparkle i just saved your cousin from beingtrepanned and sent for a soldiertallyhoho appeared all amazementwhat cried tom in the wars of venus then i suppose i know he has afancy for astronomy and probably he was desirous of taking a peep intoshirelane where he might easily find the sun moon and seven starsha ha ha replied sparkle not exactly so but i rescued him fromthe hands of a buffer who would buffers miscalled duffers persons who adopt a species ofswindling which is rather difficult of detection though itis daily practised in london the term buffer takes itsderivation from a custom which at one time prevailed ofcarrying bandanas garnets french stockings and silk ofvarious kinds next the shirts of the sellers so that uponmaking a sale they were obliged to undress in order to comeat the goods or in other words to strip to the skin orbuff it by which means they obtained the title of buffersthis trade if it may be so termed is carried on in agenteel manner the parties go about from house to houseand attend publichouses inns and fairs pretending tosell smuggled goods such as those already mentioned and byoffering their goods for sale they are enabled by practiceto discover the proper objects for their artsbuffers or duffers who are not rogues in the strict senseof the word only offer to sell their goods to the bestadvantage and by this means evade the detection of thepolice but are equally subversive or destructive of commonhonesty under a cloak or disguise for if they can persuadeany person that the article offered is actually better orcheaper than any other person's they are doing no more thanevery tradesman does but then as they pay no rent or taxesto the state the principal objection to them lies in themode of operation and an overstrained recommendation oftheir goods which are always according to their accountof the most superior quality and they have a peculiarfacility of discovering the novice or the silly to whomwalking up with a serious countenance and interesting airthey broach the pleasing intelligence that they have onsale an excellent article well worth their attention givinga caution at the same time that honour and secrecy must beimplicitly observed or it may lead to unpleasantness toboth parties by these means persons from the country arefrequently enticed into publichouses to look at theirgoods and if they do not succeed in one way they arealmost sure in another by having an accomplice who willnot fail to praise the articles for sale and propose somegambling scheme by which the party is plundered of hismoney by passing forged banknotes base silver or copperin the course of their dealingsdoubtless have fleeced him in good

their counters anda few nights back a scotchman returning from his enjoyments at aneighbouring tavern stopped to have a little friendly chat with thisgentleman's highlander and by some means or other

occasion to begrateful to the highlanders for some portion of his popularity it is matter of astonishment to some but not less truethat many tradesmen in the metropolis have to ascribe bothfame and fortune to adventitious circumstances it is saidthat hardham of fleet street had to thank the celebratedcomedian foote who in one of his popular charactersintroducing his snuffbox offered a pinch to the person hewas in conversation with on the stage who spoke well of itand inquired where he obtained it why at hardham's tobe sure and to this apparently trifling circumstancehardham was indebted for his fortunethe importance of a highlander to a snuffshop will appearby a perusal of the following facta very respectable young man a clerk in the office of aneminent solicitor was recently brought before mr aldermanatkins upon the charge of being disorderly the prisonerit seemed on his return home from a social party where hehad been sacrificing rather too freely to the jolly god wasstruck with

hiscountryman he chucked him familiarly under the chin calledhim a very pretty fellow and in the vehemence of hisaffection embraced him with so much violence as to forcehim from his station mr micklan ran to the assistance ofhis servant and in the scuffle the unfortunate highlanderhad both his arms dislocated the frill that adorned hisneck damaged besides other personal injuries which hisliving countryman not being in the humour to atone for mrmickle gave him in charge to the watchman before themagistrate in the morning the young man appeared heartilysick of his folly and perfectly willing

fracture of both arms with a mutilationof three or four fingers and such other bodily wounds asto render his perfect recovery so as to resume hisfunctions at mr micklan's door altogether hopeless thehighlander the complainant stated cost him thirteenguineas and was entirely new the sum might seem large forthe young gentleman to pay for such a frolic but it wouldnot compensate him for the injury he should sustain by theabsence of the figure for however strange it might appearhe did not hesitate to say that without it he should nothave more than half his business since he had stationed itat his door he had taken on an average thirty shillings aday more than he had done previous to exhibiting hisattractionsthere being no proof of a breach of the peace mr aldermanatkins advised the

themerriment of the scene before them perhaps more than those actuallyengaged in it bob was alive to every movement and every character forit was new and truly interesting and kept growing more so for in afew minutes limping billy and mother mapps joined the slaughterman inthe dance when nothing could be more grotesque and amusing their pipesin their mouths clapping of hands and snapping of fingers

innumber for as one went out another came inthis new customer was a younglooking man bearing a large board on ahigh pole announcing the residence of a bugdestroyer in the strandhis appearance was grotesque in the extreme and could only be equalledby the eccentricities of his manners and conversation he was dressedin a brown coat close buttoned over which he had a red camlet or stuffstout apparently the offcast of some theatrical performer but witha determination to appear fashionable forfolks might as well be dead nay buried tooas not to dress and act as others dohe wore mustachios a pair of green spectacles and his whole figure wassurmounted with a furcap taking a seat directly opposite our partyat the same table bring me a pint said he and then deliberatelysearching his pockets he produced a short pipe and some tobacco withwhich he filled it you see said he i am obliged to smoke accordingto the doctor's orders for an asthma so i always smokes three pipes aday that's my

of a newtragedy from the pen of lord byron particularly under the circumstancesof its introduction to the stage against the expressed inclination ofits author the at an early hour on the evening this tragedy was firstproduce at drury lane handbills were plentifullydistributed through the theatre of which the following is acopythe public are respectfully informed that therepresentation of lord byron's tragedy the doge of venicethis evening takes place in defiance of the injunction fromthe lord chancellor which was not applied for until theremonstrance of the publisher at the earnest desire of thenoble author had failed in protecting that drama from itsintrusion on the stage for which it was never intendedthis announcement had the effect of exciting publicexpectation beyond its usual pitch upon such occasions thecircumstances were somewhat new in the history of the dramathe question being whether a published flay could belegally brought on the stage without the consent or ratherwe should say in defiance of the author we are not awarewhether this question has been absolutely decided but thiswe do know that the piece was performed several nights andunderwent all the puffing of the adventurous manager aswell as all the severity of the critics the newspapers ofthe day were filled with histories and observations upon itno subject engrossed the conversation of the polite andplaygoing part of the community but lord byron the doge ofvenice and mr ellison they were all praised andplastered exalted and debased acquitted and condemnedbut it was generally allowed on all hands that the printedtragedy contained many striking beauties notwithstandingits alleged resemblance to venice preserved we arehowever speaking of the acted tragedy and the magnanimousmanager who with such promptitude produced it in an alteredshape and having already alluded to the theatrical puffingso constantly resorted to upon all occasions we shall dropthe curtain upon the subject after merely remarking thatthe times of the same day has been known to contain themanager's puff declaring the piece to have beenreceived with rapturous applause in direct oppositionto the editor's critique which as unequivocally pronouncedits complete failurewill of its publisher and the injunctions of the lordchancellor were attractions of no ordinary nature and injunction the word injunction implies a great deal andhas in its sound so much of the terrific as in manyinstances to paralyze exertion on the part of the supposedoffending person or persons it has been made the instrumentof artful designing and malicious persons aided bypettifogging or pretended attorneys to obtain money forthemselves and clients by way of compromise and in numerousinstances it is well known that fear has been construed intoactual guilt injunctions are become so common that evenpenny print sellers have lately issued threats and promisedactual proceedings against the venders of articles said tobe copies from their original drawings and even carried itso far as to withhold kind souls the execution of theirpromises upon the payment of a l from those who wereeasily to be duped having no inclination to encounter theglorious uncertainty of the law or no time to spare forlitigation we have recently been furnished with a curiouscase which occurred in utopia where it appears by ourinformant that the laws hold great similarity with our owna certain house of considerable respectability had importeda large quantity of welsh cheese which were packed inwooden boxes and offered them for sale a great rarity inutopia as double gloucesterit is said that two of a trade seldom agree how far theadage may apply to utopia will be seen in the sequel atradesman residing in the next street a short time afterreceived an importation from gloucester of the favouritedouble production of that place packed in a similar wayand as was very natural for a tradesman to do at least weknow it is so here the latter immediately began to vendhis cheese as the real double gloucester this was anoffence beyond bearing the high court of equity was movedsimilar we suppose to our high court of chancery tosuppress the sale of the latter but as no proof ofdeception could be produced it was not granted this onlyincreased the flame already excited in the breasts of thefirst importers every effort was made use of to find a goodand sufficient excuse to petition the court again and atlength they found out one of the craft to swear that as thereal gloucester had been imported in boxes of a similarshape make and wood it was quite evident that thepossessor must have bought similar cheeses and was imposingon the public to their great disadvantage notwithstandingthey could not find a similarity either of taste smell orappearance in the mean time the real gloucester cheesebecame a general favourite with the inhabitants of utopiaand upon this though slender ground the innocent tradesmanwas served with a process enjoining him not to do thatwhich poor man he never intended to do and besides if hehad the people of that country were not such ignoramuses asto be so deceived it was merely to restrain him fromselling his own real double gloucester as their welshcheeses purporting as they did to be double gloucesteror of mixing them together than which nothing could befurther from his thoughts and charging him at the sametime with having sold his cheeses under their name but themost curious part of the business was the real cheesemanbrought the investigation before the court cheeses in boxeswere produced and evidence was brought forward when asthe charges alleged could not be substantiated therestraint was removed and the three importers of welshcheese hung their heads and retired in dudgeonthe hon tom availed himself of the circumstance to leave the boxthough the truth was there were other attractions of a more enliveningcast in his viewcome said he we shall have a better

performance however this was compensated in some degree by amore extensive prospect round the house and his eyes were seen movingin all directions without seeming to know where to fix while sparkleand bob were attracted by a fight in the gallery between a soldier anda gentleman's servant in livery for some supposed insult offeredto the companion of the latter and which promised serious resultsfrom the repeated vociferations of those around them of throw emover throw em over while the gifts of the gods were plentifullyshowered down upon the inhabitants of the lower regions in the shapeof

gratified at viewingthe splendour of its decorations the arched ceiling the two massycorinthian columns of vera antique and the ten correspondingpilasters on each side struck him as particularly

youobserve nothing but joyful and animated features while perhaps thevulture of misery is gnawing at the heart i could give you histories ofseveral of these unfortunates a life of prostitution is a life fraught with too manymiseries to be collected in any moderate compass the modein which they are treated by parties who live upon theproduce of their infamy the rude and boisterous nay oftenbrutal manner in which they are used by those with whom theyoccasionally associate and the horrible reflections oftheir own minds are too frequently and too fatallyattempted to be obliterated by recourse to the bacchanalianfount reason becomes obscured and all decency andpropriety abandoned passion rules predominantly until itextinguishes itself and leaves the wretched victim of earlydelusion vitiated both in body and mind to drag on amiserable existence without character without friends andalmost without hope there is unfortunately however nooccasion for the exercise of imagination on this subjectthe annals of our police occurrences furnish too manyexamples of actual circumstances deeply to be deplored andwe have selected one of a most atrocious kind which recentlytook place and is recorded as followsprostitution an unfortunate girl apparently about eighteen years ofage and of the most interesting and handsome person butwhose attire indicated extreme poverty and distress appliedto the sitting magistrate richard bimie esq under thefollowing circumstances it appeared from the statementthat she had for the last three weeks been living at a houseof ill fame in exeterstreet strand kept by a man namedjames locke this wretch had exacted the enormous sum ofthree guineas per week for her board and lodging and inconsequenceof her not being able to pay the sum due for thelast week he threatened to strip her of her cloaths andturn her naked into the street this threat he deferredexecuting until yesterday morning having in the mean timekept her locked up in a dark room without any coveringwhatever when in lieu of her cloaths he gave her thetattered and loathsome garments she then appeared in whichwere barely sufficient to preserve common decency and thenbrutally turned her into the street being thus plunged intothe most abject wretchedness without money or friends towhom she could apply in her present situation her bodilystrength exhausted by the dissipated life she had led andrendered more so by a long abstinence from food her spiritsbroken and overcome by the bitter and humiliatingreflection that her own guilty conduct debarred her fromflying to the fostering arms of affectionate parents whomshe had loaded with disgrace and misery and the nowinevitable exposure of her infamy it was some time ere herwandering senses were sufficiently composed to determinewhat course she should pursue in the present emergency whenshe thought she could not do better than have recourse tothe justice of her country against the villain lock who hadso basely treated her and after extreme pain anddifficulty she succeeded in dragging her enfeebled limbs tothe office during the detail of the foregoing particularsshe seemed overwhelmed with shame and remorse and at timessobbed so violently as to render her voice inarticulate herpiteous case excited the attention and sympathy of allpresent and it was much to the general satisfaction thatmr bimie ordered humphrey one of the conductors of thepatrol to fetch lock to the office on being brought therethe necessary proceedings were gone into for the purpose ofindicting the house as a common brothelit was afterwards discovered that this unhappy girl was ofthe most respectable parents and for the last six years hadbeen residing with her aunt about three months ago somedifference having arisen between them she absconded takingwith her only a few shillings and the clothes she thenwore the first night of her remaining from home she went todrurylane theatre and was there pick'd up by a genteelwoman dressed in black who having learned her situationenticed her to a house in hartstreet coventgarden wherethe ruin of the poor girl was finally effected it was notuntil she had immersed herself in vice and folly that shereflected on her situation and it was then too late toretract and after suffering unheard of miseries was inthe short space of three months reduced to her presentstate of wretchednessthe worthy magistrate ordered that proper care should betakenof the girl which was readily undertaken on the partof the parishthe prisoner set up a defence in which he said a friendof the girl's owed him l and that he detained her clothesfor it but was stopped by mr bimiehe at first treated the matter very lightly but onperceiving the determination on the part of the parish toproceed he offered to give up the things this however hewas not allowed to dowho are exercising all their arts to entrap customers apparently fullof life and vivacity who perhaps dare not approach their homeswithout the produce of their successful blandishments but this is not aplace for moralizing a truce to old care and the blue devils come onmy boy let us take a turn in the

in the saloon and now introduced leaning uponthe arm of his cousin the enticing goddesses of pleasure hungaround them at every step every one anxious to be foremost in theirassiduities to catch the newcomer's smile and the odds were almost acornucopia to a cabbagenet that bob would be hook'dtom was still evidently disappointed and after pacing the lobby once ortwice and whispering bob to make his observations the subject of futureinquiry they returned to the saloon where sparkle met them almost outof breath declaring he had been hunting them in all parts of the housefor the last half hourtom laugh'd heartily at this and complimented sparkle on the ingenuitywith which he managed his affairs but i see how it is said he andi naturally suppose you are engagedsuspicion ever haunts the guilty mind and i perceive clearly thatyou are only disappointed that you are not engaged where are all yourgolden dreams nowpshaw there is no such thing as speaking to you said tom ratherpeevishly without feeling a lash like a cartwhip this was a touch of the satirical which it appears did notexactly suit the taste of dashall as it applied to theladybird who had attracted his attention on entering thehousemerely in return continued sparkle for the genteel not tosay gentle manner in which you handle the horsewhipthere is something very mulish in all this said bob interrupting theconversation i don't understand itnor i neither said tom leaving the arm of his cousin and steppingforwardthis hasty dismissal of the subject under debate had been occasioned bythe appearance of a lady whose arm tom immediately took upon leavingthat of his cousin a circumstance which seemed to restore harmony toall parties tallyhoho and sparkle soon joined them and after a few turnsfor the purpose of seeing and being seen it was proposed to adjournto the oystershop directly opposite the front of the theatre and withthat view they in a short time departed but not without an addition oftwo other ladies selected from the numerous frequenters of the saloonmost of whom appeared to be well known both to tom and sparklethe appearance of the outside was very pleasing the brilliance of thelights the neat and cleanly style in which its contents were displayedseemed inviting to appetite and in a very short time a cheerful repastwas served up while the room was progressively filling with companyand mother p was kept in constant activitybob was highly gratified with the company and the manner in which theywere entertaineda vast crowd of dashing young beaux and elegantly dressed bellescalling about them for oysters lobsters salmon shrimps breadand butter sodawater gingerbeer c kept up a sort of runningaccompaniment to the general conversation in which they were engagedwhen

sleepthat said sparkle is a distinguished member of the tilbury club andis denominated a ruffian a kind of character that gains ground as tonumbers over the exquisite but he is very different in polish a partiality to these coloured habits is undoubtedlyintended to impress upon the minds of plebeian beholders anexalted idea of their own consequence or to prove perhapsthat their conceptions are as superior to common ones as thesky is to the earth the variety of denominations that have at different timesbeen given to drunkenness forms an admirable specimen ofingenuity well worthy of remark the derivation of lusty webelieve is from a very common expression that a drunkenman votes for washington but perhaps it would be ratherdifficult to discover the origin of many terms made use

without muchdifficulty thrust into it give me a lift said thefrolicsome blade and away he went with the load onarriving at the doctor's door he pulled the night bellwhen the assistant made his

the booty kid in the sack feeling a suddeninternal turn of the contents of his stomach which brought with it aheaving fell from the upright situation in which he had been placedon the floor this so alarmed the young doctor that he ran with allspeed after the vender and just coming up to him at the corner of thestreetwhy said he you have left me a living mannever mind replied the other kill him when you want him andmaking good use of his heels he quickly disappeareda comedian of some celebrity but who is now too old for theatricalservice relates a circumstance which occurred to him upon his firstarrival in townhaving entered into an engagement to appear upon the boards of one ofthe london theatres he sought the metropolis some short time before theopening of the house and conceiving it necessary to his professionto study life real life as it is he was accustomed to minglepromiscuously in almost all society with this view he frequentlyentered the tap rooms of the lowest public houses to enjoy his pipe andhis pint keeping the main object always in viewto catch the manners living as they risecalling one evening at one of these houses not far from drury lane hefound some strapping fellows engaged in conversation interlarded withmuch flash and low slang but decently dressed he mingled in a sort ofgeneral dialogue with them on the state of the weather politics cafter sitting some time in their company and particularly noticingtheir persons and apparent charactercome bill it is time to be off it is getting ratherdarkish ah very well replied the other let us haveanother quart and then i am your man for a bit of a larkby this time they had learned that the comedian was butnewly arrived in town and he on the other hand was desirousof seeing what they meant to be up to after another quartthey were about to move when said one to the other as weareonly going to have a stroll and a bit of fun perhapsthat there young man would like to join usah what say you sir have you any objection but perhapsyou have business on hand and are engaged no i have nothing particular to do was the reply verywell then if you like to go with us we shall be glad ofyour companywell said he i don't care if i do spend an hour withyou and with that they sallied forthafter rambling about for some time in the vicinity oftottenham court road shewing him some of the squares cdescribing the names of streets squares and buildingsthey approached st giles's and leading him under agateway stop said one we must call upon jack you knowfor old acquaintance sake and gave a loud knock at thedoor which being opened without a word they all walked inand the door was instantly lock'd he was now introduced toa man of squalid appearance with whom they all shook handsthe mode of introduction was not however of so satisfactorya description as had been expected being very laconic andconveyed in the following language we have got himyes yes it is all right come jack serve us out somegrog and then to businessthe poor comedian in the mean time was left in the utmostanxiety and surprise to form an opinion of his situationfor as he had heard something about trepanning pressingc he could not help entertaining serious suspicion that heshould either be compellet to serve as a soldier or asailor and as he had no intention to gain a name in armsthey were neither of them suitable to his inclinationscome said one walk up stairs and sit down jack bringthe lush and up stairs they wentupon entering a gloomy room somewhat large with only asmall candle he had not much opportunity of discoveringwhat sort of a place it was though it looked wretchedenough the grog was brought here's all round the gravestonesaid one come drink away my hearty don't bealarm'd we are rum fellows and we'll put you up to a rigortwo we are got a rum covey in the corner there and youmust lend us a hand to get rid of him then holding up thelight what was the surprise of the poor comedian to espy adead body of a man you can help us to get him away andby g you shall too it's of no use to flinch nowa circumstance of this kind was new to him so that hisperplexity was only increased by the discovery but heplainly perceived by the last declaration that havingengaged in the business it would be of no use to leave ithalf done he therefore remained silent upon the subjectdrank his grog when jack came up stairs to say the cart wasreadylend a hand said one of them let us get our load downstairscome my master turn to with a good heart all'srightwith this the body was conveyed down stairsat the back of the house was a small yard separated from aneighbouring street by a wall a signal was given by someoneon the other side which was understood by those withinit was approaching nine o'clock and a dark night comesaid one of them mount you to the top of the wall andding the covey over to the carcasscarter this beingcomplied with the dead body was handed up to him which wasno sooner done than the carman outside perceiving thewatchman approach it won't do said he and giving awhistle drove his cart with an assumed air of carelessnessaway while the poor comedian who had a new character tosupport in which he did not conceive himself well upwas holding the dead man on his lap with the legs projectingover the wall it was a situation of the utmost delicacy andthere was no time to recast the part he was thereforeobliged to blunder through it as well as he could theperspiration of the living man fell plentifully on thefeatures of the dead as the charley approached in a positionto pass directly under him those inside had sought theshelter of the house telling him to remain quiet till theold scout was gone by now although he was not fullyacquainted with the consequences of discovery he waswilling and anxious to avoid them he therefore took theadvice and scarcely moved or breathed past nine o'clocksaid the watchman as he passed under the legs of the deadbody without looking up though he was within an inch ofhaving his castor brushed off by them being thus relievedhe was happy to see the cart return he handed over theunpleasant burthen and as quick as possible afterwardsdescended from his elevated situation into the streetdetermining at all hazards to see the result of this to himextraordinary adventure with this view he followed the cartat a short distance keeping his eye upon it as he wentalong and in one of the streets leading to long acre heperceived a man endeavouring to look into the back part ofthe cart but was diverted from his object by one of the menwho had introduced him to the house while another of theconfederates snatched the body from the cart and ran withallspeed down another street in an opposite direction thismovement had attracted the notice of the watchman whobeing prompt in his movements had sprung his rattle uponthis and feeling himself too heavily laden to secure hisretreat the fellow with the dead man perceiving the gate ofan area open dropped his burden down the steps shamed thegate after him and continued to fly but was stopped at theend of the street in the mean time the charley in pursuithad knock'd at the door of the house where the stolen goodsas he supposed were deposited a cant phrase for moneyit was kept by an old maiden lady who upon discovering thedead body of a man upon her premises had fainted in thewatchman's arms the detection of the runningresurrectionist was followed by a walk to the watchhousewhere his companions endeavoured to make it appear that theyhad all been dining at wandsworth together that he was notthe person against whom the hue and cry had been raised butold noose l said it wouldn't do and he was thereforedetained to appear before the magistrate in the morning thecomedian who had minutely watched their proceedings tookcare to be at bowstreet in good time where he found uponthe affidavits of two of his comrades who swore they haddined together at wandsworth their pal was liberated the constable of the nightbob could not very well understand what was the meaning of thislingo he was perfectly at a loss to comprehend the terms of peabodysnatching and the resurrection rig the crowd increased as they wentalong and as they did not exactly relish their company sparkle ledthem across the way and then proceeded to explainwhy said sparkle the custom of deadbody snatching has becomevery common in london and in many cases appears to be winked at by themagistrates for although it is considered a felony in law it is alsoacknowledged in some degree to be necessary for the surgeons inorder to have an opportunity of obtaining practical information it ishowever at the same time a source of no slight distress to the parentsand friends of the parties who are dragg'd from the peaceful security ofthe tomb the resurrectionmen are generally well rewarded for theirlabours by the surgeons who employ them to procure subjects they arefor the most part fellows who never stick at trifles but make a decentlivelihood by moving off if they can not only the bodies but coffinsshrouds c and are always upon the lookout wherever there is afuneral nay there have been instances in which the bodies have beendug from their graves within a few hours after being deposited thereit is a shameful practice said bob and ought not to be toleratedhowever nor can i conceive how with the apparent vigilance of thepolice it can be carried onnothing more easy said sparkle where the plan is well laid thesefellows when they hear a passingbell toll skulk about the parish fromalehouse to alehouse till they can learn a proper account ofwhat the deceased died of what condition the body is in c with whichaccount they go to a resurrection doctor who agrees for a pricewhich is mostly five guineas for the body of a man and then bargainwith an undertaker for the shroud coffin c which perhaps with alittle alteration may serve to run through the whole familyand is it possible said bob that there are persons who will enterinto such bargainsno doubt of it nay there was an instance of a man really selling hisown body to a surgeon to be appropriated to his own purposes when deadfor a certain weekly sum secured to him while living but in robbingthe churchyards there are always many engaged in the rig for notice isgenerally given that the body will be removed in the night to which thesexton is made privy and receives the information with as much ease ashedid to have it brought his price being a guinea for the use of thegrubbing irons adjusting the grave c this system is generallycarried on in little country churchyards within a few miles of londona hackneycoach or a cart is ready to receive the stolen property andthere cannot be a doubt but many of these depredations are attended withsuccess the parties escaping with their prey undetected nay i knowof an instance that occurred a short time back of a young man who wasburied at wesley's chapel on which occasion one of the mourners alittle more wary than the rest could not help observing two or threerough fellows in the ground during the ceremony which aroused hissuspicion that they intended after interment to have the body of hisdeparted friend this idea became so strongly rooted in his mind thathe imparted his suspicions to the remainder of those who had followedhim himself and another therefore determined if possible to satisfythemselves upon the point by returning in the dusk of the evening toreconnoitre they accordingly proceeded to the spot but the gates beingshut one of them climbed to the top of the wall where he discoveredthe very parties he had before noticed in the act of wrenching openthe coffin here they are said he hard at it as i expected butbefore he and his friend could get over the wall the villainseffected their escape leaving behind them a capacious sack and all theimplements of their infernal trade they secured the body had itconveyed home again and in a few days reburied it in a place ofgreater securitybob was surprised at this description of the resurrectionrig but wasquickly drawn from his contemplation of the depravity of human natureand what he could not help thinking the dirty employments of life bya shouting apparently from several voices as they passed the end ofst martin's lane it came from about eight persons who appeared to bejourneymen

met his inamorata shortly afterwards inchelseafields and after obtaining from her sundryparticulars of inquiry as to the name of her husband che acquainted her with his plan the preliminaries wereagreed upon and it was determined that the maidservantwho was stationed as a spy upon her at all times should bedispatched to some house in the neighbourhood to procurechange while the man of letters was to be let in andconcealed and upon her return it was to be stated that thepostman was in a hurry could not wait and was to callagain this done he was to make his escape by a ropeladderfrom the window as soon as the old one should be heard uponthe stairs which it of course was presumed would be at alate hour when he was drunkthe train having been thus laid old vigilance dined outand expected to meet the colonel but being disappointedand suspicious at all times forsuspicion ever haunts the guilty mindthe utmost endeavours of the party to make him drunk provedineffectual he was restless and uncomfortable and he couldnot help fancying by the visible efforts to do him up thatsome mischief was brewing or some hoax was about to beplayed off he had his masterkey in his pocket and retiredearlyhis lady whose plan had succeeded admirably at home wasfearful of having the door bolted till after twelve lestthe servant's suspicions should be aroused in the inhabitants of ourown sphere of action and i trust we shall all become better known toeach otherthis piece of information appeared to be truly acceptable to allparties young mortimer was a goodlooking and well made young man hisfeatures were animated and intelligent his manners polished thoughnot quite so unrestrained as those which are to be acquired by anacquaintance with metropolitan associationsi am happy said he to be introduced to any friends of your's andshall be proud to number them among mineyou may replied sparkle with great safety place them on your listthough you know i have already made it appear to you that friendship isa term more generally made use of than understood in londonfor what is friendship but a namea charm which lulls to sleepa shade that follows wealth and fameand leaves the wretch to weepand love is still an emptier soundthe modern fair one's jeston earth unseen or only foundto warm the turtle's nestthese sentiments are excellently expressed said tom pinching him bythe arm and i suppose in perfect consonance with your ownsparkle felt the rebuke look'd down and seem'd confused but in amoment recovering himselfnot exactly so replied he but then you know and i don'tmind confessing it among friends though you are aware it is veryunfashionable to acknowledge the existence of any thing of the kind iam a pupil of natureyou seem to be in a serious humour all at once said young mortimercan't help it continued sparkle forlet them all say what they willnature will be nature stilland that usurper or i should rather say would be usurper fashionis in no way in alliance with our natures i remember the old duchess ofmarlborough used to say that to love some persons very much and tosee often those we love is the greatest happiness i can enjoy butit appears almost impossible for any person in london to secure such anenjoyment and i can't help feeling itby the look and manner with which this last sentiment was uttered tomplainly discovered there was a something labouring at his heart whichprompted it moralizing said he ah charley you are a happyfellow i never yet knew one who could so rapidly change from grave togay from lively to severe and for the benefit of our friends i can'thelp thinking you could further elucidate the very subject you have sofeelingly introducedyou are a quiz said sparkle but there is one thing to be saidi know you and have no great objection to your hits now and thenprovided they are not knock down blowsbut said mortimer what has this to do with friendship and love ithought you were going to give something like a london definition of thetermswhy said sparkle in london it is equally difficult to get to loveany body very much or often to meet those that we love there are suchnumbers of acquaintances such a constant succession of engagements ofone sort or other such a round of delights that the town resemblesvauxhall where the nearest and dearest friends may walk round and roundall night without once meeting for instance at dinner you should see aperson whose manners and conversation are agreeable and pleasing to youyou may wish in vain to become more intimate for the chance is thatyou will not meet so as to converse a second time for many monthsfor no one can tell when the dicebox of society may turn up the samenumbers again i do not mean to infer that you may not barely see thesame features again it is possible that you may catch a glimpse of themon the opposite side of pall mall or bondstreet or see them nearto you at a crowded rout without a possibility of approachingit is from this cause that those who live in london are so totallyindifferent to each other the waves follow so quick that every vacancyis immediately filled up and the want is not perceived the wellbredcivility of modern times and the example of some very popular peopleit is true have introduced a shaking of hands a pretended warmth adissembled cordiality into the manners of the cold and warm alikethe dear friend and the acquaintance of yesterday consequently wecontinually hear such conversation as the following ah how d'ye doi'm delighted to see you how is mrs m she's very well thank you has she any increase in family anyincrease why i've only been married three months i see you are talkingof my former wife bless you she has been dead these three years orah my dear friend how d'ye do you have been out of town some timewhere have you been in norfolk no i have been two years in indiathis description of a friendly salutation appeared to interest andamuse both talltho and mortimer tom laughed shrugged up his shouldersacknowledged the picture was too true and sparkle continuedand thus it is that ignorant of one another's interests andoccupations the generality of friendships of london contain nothingmore tender than a visiting card nor are they much better indeed theyare much worse if you renounce the world and determine to live onlywith your relations and nearest connexions for if you go to see themat one o'clock they are not stirring at two the room is full ofdifferent acquaintances who talk over the occurrences of the lastnight's ball and of course are paid more attention to than yourselfat three they are out shopping at four they are in this place dashingamong the pinks from which they do not return till seven then they aredressing at eight they are dining with two dozen friends at nine andten the same at eleven they are dressing for the ball and at twelvewhen you are retiring to rest they are gone into society for theevening so that you are left in solitude you soon begin again to trythe world and we will endeavour to discover what it producesthe first inconvenience of a london life is the late hour of afashionable dinner to pass the day in fasting and then sit down to agreat dinner at eight o'clock is entirely against the first dictates ofcommon sense and common stomachs but what is to be done he who railsagainst the fashion of the times will be considered a most unfashionabledog and perhaps i have already said more than sufficient to entitle meto that appellationdon't turn king's evidence against yourself said tom for if youplead guilty in this happy country you must be tried by your peersnay said mortimer while fashion and reason appear to be in suchdirect opposition to each other i must confess their merits deserveto be impartially tried though i cannot for one moment doubt but thelatter must ultimately prevail with the generality however her dictatesmay be disregarded by the votaries of the formeryou are a good one at a ramble said tom and not a bad one in aspree but i cannot help thinking you are rambling out of your roadyou seem to have lost the thread of your subject and having beendisappointed with love and friendship you are just going to sit down todinnerpardon me replied sparkle i was proceeding naturally and notfashionably to my subject but i know you are so great an admirer ofthe latter that you care but little about the formerhit for hit said tom but go on you are certainly growing oldsparkle at all events you appear very grave this morning and ifyou continue in this humour long i shall expect you are about takingordersthere is a time for all things but the time for that has not yetarrivedwell then proceed without sermonizingi don't like to be interrupted replied sparkle and there is yetmuch to be said on the subject i find there are many difficultiesto encounter in contending with sinby this time they were at the gate where finding the curricle and thenags all in readiness sparkle and mortimer were soon horsed and tomand bob seated in the curricle they proceeded to richmond takingsurveys of the scenery on the road and discoursing on the usual topicsof such a journey which being foreign to the professed intention ofthis work are omitted suffice it to say they returned refreshed fromthe excursion and parted with a promise to meet again at nine o'clockin grosvenor squareegad said dashall as they entered the diningroom there issomething very mysterious in all this sparkle has hitherto been thelife and soul of society he seems to be deeply smitten with this younglady miss mortimer and promises fairly by his manner to prove adeserter from our standard and to inlist under the banners of hymennot unlikely replied tallyhoho if what we are told be true that itis what we must all come tobe that as it may it ought not to interfere with our pursuits reallife in london though to be sure the ladies dear creatures oughtnot to be forgotten they are so nearly and dearly interwoven with ourexistence that without them life would be insupportableafter dinner they prepared for the evening party and made theirappearance in grosvenor squire at the appointed hour but as this willintroduce new characters to the reader we shall defer our account ofthem till the next chapterchapter xivye are stars of the night ye are gems of the mornye are dewdrops whose lustre illumines the thornand rayless that night is that morning unblestwhen no beam in your eye lights up peace in the breastand the sharp thorn of sorrow sinks deep in the hearttill the sweet lip of woman assuages the smarttis

entreated with the willowher smile is our meed and her bosom our pillowarrived at grosvenor square they found the party consisted of colonelb his son and daughter miss mortimer and her brother mrsparkle mr merrywell and lady lovelace the first salutations ofintroduction being over there was time to observe the company amongwhom miss mortimer appeared to be the principal magnet of attractionthe old colonel was proud to see the friends of mr sparkle and hadpreviously given a hearty welcome to mr merrywell as the friend of hisnephew the young mortimer sparkle now appeared the gayest of the gayand had been amusing the company with some of his liveliest descriptionsof character and manners that are to be witnessed in the metropoliswhile merrywell who did not seem to be pleased with the particularattentions he paid to miss mortimer was in close conversation with herbrothertom could not but acknowledge that it was scarcely possible to see missmortimer without feelings of a nature which he had scarcely experiencedbefore the elegant neatness of her dress was calculated to display thebeauty of her form and the vivid flashes of a dark eye were somany irresistible attacks upon the heart a sweet voice and smilingcountenance appeared to throw a radiance around the room andilluminate the visages of the whole party while lady lovelaceand maria b served as a contrast to heighten that effect whichthey envied and reproved while tea was preparing after which it wasproposed to take a rubber at cards a sort of general conversation tookplace the preparations for the coronation the new novels of the dayand the amusements of the theatre were canvassed in turn and speakingof the writings of sir walter scott as the presumed author of thecelebrated scotch novels lady lovelace declared she found it impossibleto procure the last published from the library notwithstanding her namehas been long on the list so much was it in requestsparkle replied that he had purchased the novel and would willinglylend it to the ladies as for the libraries continued he they aregood places of accommodation but it is impossible to please every oneeither there or any where else they are however very amusing at timesand as a proof of it i strolled the other morning to a circulatinglibrary for the express purpose of lounging away an hour in digestingthe politics and news of the day but the curious scenes to which iwas witness during this short period so distracted my attention thatdespite of the grave subjects on which i was meditating i could notresist lending an attentive ear to all that passed around me there wassomething of originality in the countenance of the master of the librarywhich struck me forcibly and the whimsical answers which he made to hisnumerous subscribers and the yet more whimsical tone in which theywere pronounced more than once provoked a smile the first personwho attracted my notice was a fine showy looking woman dressed inthe extreme of fashion with a bloom upon her cheek which might haveemulated that of the rose with this exception that it wanted the charmof nature putting a list into the hands of the bookseller sheinquired if he had any of the productions the names of which werethere transcribed glancing his eye over the paper he replied withan archness which not a little disconcerted her and which probablyoccasioned her abrupt disappearance the fine lady madam is seldomor ever at home but family secrets we are always ready to let outcharacters of eminent men growled out a little vulgar consequentialcitizen whose countenance bore the stamp of that insufferabledulness that might almost tempt one to imagine him incapable ofcomprehending the meaning of the words which he pronounced with an airof so much selfimportance characters of eminent men repeatedthe snarler in the same tone i much fear if we can boast a quarterof that number eh mr margin i fear not sir replied marginbut such as we have are very much at your service better be in theservice of the nation than in mine by far said the little purseproudgentleman shrugging his shoulders very significantly shall i sendit for you sir said margin without noticing the last remark by nomeans by no means the volume is not so large it won't encumber memuch i believe i shall find it small enough to put in my pocketpursued the little great man grinning at the shrewdness of his ownobservations and stalking out with as much selfcomplacency as he hadstalked in i knew the man well and could not help laughing at thelofty airs he assumed at the manner in which he affected to decry allhis countrymen without mercy at his unwillingness to acknowledgeany talent amongst them though he himself was a man of that ploddingdescription who neither ever had done nor ever could do any thing toentitle him to claim distinction of any sort the young coxcomb who nextentered was a direct contrast to the last applicant both in person andmanner approaching with a fashionable contortion he stretched out hisladylike hand and in the most languid and affected tone imaginableinquired for the idler that sir said margin is amongst the workswe have unhappily lost but you will be sure to meet with it at any ofthe fashionable libraries in the neighbourhood of bond street or stjames's the young fop had just sense enough to perceive that the shaftwas aimed at him but not enough to relish the joke or correct thefollies which provoked it and turned abruptly on his heel he was metat the door by a sentimental boardingschool miss who came flying intothe shop in defiance of her governess and inquired in a very pathetictone for the constant lover that i am afraid said margin isnot amongst our collection dear me lisped the young lady with anair of chagrin that's very provoking i thought that was what everyonehad give me leave to assure you ma'am that you are quitemistaken i fancy you will find that it is not to be met with all overlondonan old gentleman of the old school whose clothes were decidedlythe cut of the last century and whose stiff and formal manners wereprecisely of the same date with his habiliments next came hobblingin poring through his spectacles over the catalogue which lay upon thecounter the first thing which caught his eye was an essay upon oldmaids tom tom said the complaisant librarian calling to a lad atthe other end of the shop reach down the old maids for the gentlemanthey won't appear to advantage i'm afraid a little dusty or damagedwith having laid so long upon the shelf he added with a simper whichwas not lost upon any one present a melancholy looking man in whosecountenance meekness and insipidity were alike plainly depictednow came forward inquiring in an under and what might almost bedesignated an alarmed tone of voice for the impertinent wife afemale who hung upon his arm interrupted him by entreating or ratherinsisting in no very gentle tone that he would ask for somethingbetter worth having margin affecting only to hear the former speakerimmediately produced the book in question and observed with muchnaivete that the impertinent wife was sure to be in the way at allhours at the same time not omitting to recommend discipline as abetter work a young man whom i knew to be one of the greatest fortunehunters about town with an air of consummate assurance put outhis hand for disinterested marriage that's a thing quite out ofdate never thought of now sir said margin who knew him as well asmyself allow me to recommend something of more recent date somethingmore sought after in the fashionable world splendid misery siror the young man heard no more spite of his impudence he was soabashed by the reply that he made a hasty retreat the last person whomi thought it worth my while to notice was a tall meagre looking manwhom i recollected to have seen pointed out to me as a wit and a geniusof the first order his wit was however of that dangerous sort whichcaused his company to be rather shunned than courted and it was veryevident from his appearance that he had not had the wit to workhimself into the good graces of those who might have had it in theirpower to befriend him though he spoke in a very low tone i soonfound that he was inquiring for plain sense on margin's replyingwith much nonchalance that plain sense had of late become veryrare finding himself disappointed in his first application his nextaim was patronage that sir said the wary bookseller is so muchsought after that i really cannot promise it to you at present but ifas i conclude you merely want something to beguile a leisure hour ortwo probably the discontented man will answer the purpose very wellto this description of sparkle the whole company listened withattention and delight frequently interrupting him with bursts oflaughter tea was handed round and then cards introduced youngmortimer and merrywell seemed to take but little interest in the playand evidently discovered their anxiety to be liberated having someother object in view mortimer felt no great portion of pleasure inpassing his time with his uncle the colonel nor with his sister ladylovelace who was a perfect model of london affectation besides hisfriend mr merrywell who was to him what tom dashall and sparkle hadbeen to tallyhoho had made an engagement to introduce him to some ofhis dashing acquaintances in the west nods and winks were interchangedbetween them and could not but be noticed by tom and bob thoughsparkle was so intent upon the amusements of the moment and the companyof the lovely caroline as to appear immoveablemr merrywell at length stated that he must be compelled to quit theparty young mortimer also apologized for as he and his friend wereengaged for an early excursion in the morning he should take a bed athis habitation in order to be fully prepared this was the first stepto breaking up the partymerrywell called sparkle on one side saying he had something ofimportance to communicate it was twelve o'clock and the gentlemenafter taking a formal leave of the ladies and the colonel and a promiseon the part of sparkle to meet them again the next morning at twelve toescort them to the exhibition left the housei am really happy said merrywell to sparkle as they passed thedoor to have had the honour of this introduction and shall have muchpleasure in becoming better acquainted with mr sparkle who thoughpersonally unknown to me his name and fame are familiarmr mortimer and myself are going to take a review of theneighbourhood of st james's probably to shake an elbowexcellent said tom here is a fine opportunity for mr tallyhoho totake a like survey and if agreeable we will join the party thoughi am by no means a friend to gaming i conceive it necessary that everyperson should see the haunts of its votaries and the arts they make useof in order to avoid themyou are right and therefore let us have a peep at them with thisthey walk'd on listening with attention to the following lines whichwere recited by sparklebehold yon group fast fix'd at break of daywhose haggard looks a sleepless night betraywith stern attention silent and profoundthe mystic table closely they surroundtheir eager eyes with eager motions joinas men who meditate some vast designsure these are statesmen met for public goodfor some among them boast of noble bloodor are they traitors holding close debateon desp'rate means to overthrow the statefor there are men among them whose domainsand goods and chattels lie within their brainsno these are students of the blackest artthat can corrupt the morals or the heartyet are they oft in fashion's ranks preferredand men of honour if you take their wordbut they can plunder pillage and devourmore than poor robbers at the midnight hourlay deeper schemes to manage lucky hitsthan artful swindlers living by their witslike cunning fowlers spread th alluring snareand glory when they pluck a pigeon barethese are our gamesters who have basely madethe cards and dice their study and their trade gaming is generally understood to have been invented bythe lydian when they were under the pressure of a greatfamine to divert themselves from dwelling on theirsufferings they contrived the balls tables c and inorder to bear their calamity the better were accustomed toplay for the whole day together without interruption thatthey might not be rack'd with the thought of food whichthey could not obtain it is not a little extraordinary thatthis invention which was originally intended as a remedyfor hunger is now a very common cause of that very eviltrue said merry well as sparkle concluded though he did notlike the satire upon his own favourite pursuit those delineations arecorrect and the versification good as far as it applies to the worstspecies of the gaminghouseo said tom then pray sir which is the worstnonsense said sparkle there is neither worse nor best these hellsare all alike sharks greeks gamblers knowing ones blacklegs anddecanters are to be met with at them all and they meet to bite oneanother's heads off an admirable description truly of the company you are about tointroduce us to gentlemen said tallyhohoi don't understand greeks hells and blacklegs said mortimer andshould like an explanationwith all my heart replied sparkle hell is the general title nowgiven to any wellknown gaminghouse and really appears to be wellchosen for all the miseries that can fall to the lot of human natureare to be found in those receptacles of idleness duplicity andvillany gaming is an estate to which all the world has a pretencethough few espouse it who are willing to secure either their estatesor reputations and these hells may fairly be considered as so manyhalfway houses to the fleet or king's bench prisons or some moredesperate end the love of play is the most incurable of insanitiesrobbery suicide and the extensive ruin of whole families have beenknown to proceed from this unfortunate and fatal propensitygreeks gamblers knowing ones and blacklegs are synonymous termsapplied to the frequenters of the modern hells or gaminghousesand may be distinguished from the rest of society by the followingpeculiarities in pursuits and mannersthe greeks of the present day though they may not lay claim to orboast of all the attributes of the greeks of antiquity must certainlybe allowed to possess that quality for which the latter were ever socelebrated namely cunning and wariness for although no modern greekcan be said to have any resemblance to achilles ajax patroclus ornestor in point of courage strength fidelity or wisdom he maynevertheless boast of being a close copier of the equally renownedchief of ithaca you will find him in most societies habited like agentleman his clothes are of the newest fashion and his mannersof the highest polish with every appearance of candour and honourwhile he subsists by unfair play at dice cards and billiardsdeceiving and defrauding all those with whom he may engage disregardingthe professions of friendship and intimacy which are continuallyfalling from his lipsto become a good greek which by the way is a contradiction itwill be found necessary to follow these instructionsin the first place lie should be able to command his temper he shouldspeak but little and when he does mingle in conversation he shouldmost decidedly deprecate play as a source of the greatest evil thatcan prey upon society and elucidate its tendencies by striking exampleswhich are well known to himself and which are so forcibly impressedupon his recollection that he is determined never to play deep againbut has no objection to a sociable and friendly game now and then justto pass the time away a little agreeably by this means he may readilymark down his man and the game once in view he should not appear tooeager in the pursuit of it but take good care as the proverb saysto give a sprat in order to catch a herring this should be done byallowing some temporary success before he make a final hitthere is perhaps no art which requires so much of continual practice asthat of greeley it is therefore necessary that the professor shouldfrequently exercise himself in private with cards and dice in orderthat his digits may be trained to a proper degree of agility upon whichthe success of his art principally depends he should also be accustomedto work with some younger man than himself who having once beena pigeon is become a nate that is enlightened and will notpeach consequently he serves as an excellent decoy to othersto ascertain the property of the pigeon he intends to pluck is anotheressential requisite and when this important information is obtainedwhich should be before he commences operations he should affect theutmost liberality as to time c and make a show of extending everyhonourable facility to his opponent even by offers of pecuniaryassistance by which means if he should be fortunate enough to haveit accepted he may probably by good management obtain a legalsecurity from him and thus be enabled to fasten on his preywhenever he pleasesthe title of a military man such as captain is very useful to thegreek as it introduces him well to society and if he has once held acommission in the army so much the better if not it can be assumedso that if any unpleasant regimental peculation should be introducedhe may place his hand on the left side of his breast declare he isastonished and alarmed at the calumnious spirit of the times shake hishead and interlard his conversation with commonplace ejaculationssuch as the following indeed no why i know harry very well he's abit of a blood can it be possible i should not have thought it blessmy heart exactly so good god a devilish good joke tho that's verytrue says i so says he c ca greek should be a man of some personal courage never shrink froma row nor be afraid to fight a duel he should be able to bullybluster swagger and swear as occasion may require nay in desperatecases such us peaching c he should not object even to assassinationhe should invite large parties to dine with him frequently and have aparticular sort of wine for particular companies he should likewise beable to swallow a tolerable quantity of the juice of the grape himselfas well as know how to appear as if he were drinking when he is merelypassing the bottle and so manage it passing as to seem drunk at propertimes when good opportunities present themselves for the exerciseof his art and when a hit is really to be made he should positivelyrefuse to suffer play of any kind in his house alleging that he hasseen enough of it and cut the concern this serves to increase thedesire for it in others on any decisive occasion when a train is knownto be well laid he should appear to be drunk before any one of theparty in which case he should take care beforehand to instruct hisdecoy to pluck the pigeon while he as a supposed observer is bettingwith some one in the company of course an accomplice and is also alosergreeks who know each other are enabled to convey information by meansof private signals without uttering a word and consequently withoutdetection at whist or other games on the cards fingers are admirableconveyancers of intelligence and by dexterous performers areso managed as to defy the closest scrutiny so as to have the naturalappearance of pliancy while among the knowing ones their movementsare actually deciding the fate of a rubberegad said mortimer you seem to understand the business so well iwonder you don't open shopmy knowledge continued sparkle is but theoretical i cannot boastof much practical information for it is long since i shook the luckycastoro then you are discontented because you have no lucknot so said sparkle for i never play very deep so that win orlose i can never suffer much but i am willing to give information toothers and with that view i have detailed the nature of the housesand the general character of their frequenters according to my ownconception of them the levanter is a blackleg who lives by thebroads l and the turf and is accustomed to work as it were bytelegraph with his pal and if you take the broads in hand in theircompany you are sure to be work'd either by glazing that is puttingyou in the front of a lookingglass by which means your hand isdiscovered by your antagonist or by private signals from the pal onthe turf he will pick up some nobleman or gentleman who he knows isnot up to the rig bet him fifty or a hundred on a horse pull out hispocketbook set down the name and promise to be at the stand whenthe race is over but takes care to be seen no more unless he isthe winner no street and both live in prime style the former in hisyouth was an errand boy and he became so willing in doinglittle jobs that his employers have paid him mosthandsomely the latter gentleman who may be seen frequentlydriving a bennet and looking both sides of the road atonce is a chip of the old block but as it is not ourintention to visit the sins of the sou upon the father weshall not enter into a minute examination of himno in burystreet is only about a year's standingthis table was set up by a broken adventurer capt b with mr a jeweller and a man whose agents keep ahouse of ill fame no way inferior in attribute to hishouse in burystreet they commenced with narrow fundsand now thank the gulls are independentthe next door no is held by m g a mapsellerliving at charing cross carl s formerly an understrapperat ben t's living at king's road chelsea h lla tallowchandler living at no burystreet andhis brother a bricklayer residing somewhere off grosvenorplace these fellows have carried on their depredations forsome time but now have closed for awhile being one of thehouses against whom a jew named portugal john and anothernamed the young black diamond have commenced proceedingsfor sums had and received and by indictmentno in the same street is the property of one od formerly a menial servant and not long ago a porter tob lthese examples shew by incontestible inference that thekeepers of those tables have an advantage which renderstheir success certain while it fleeces the men who attendthem we always have seen these proprietors in the sameunchangeable affluence driving their equipages keepingtheir country houses c c while those who playinvariably sink into poverty it has been often very oftenremarked that young men who commence this career of follyand vice by degrees lose that freshness and fashionableappearance which they at first possessed and at last areseen wandering about st james's park counting the trees and dining on a gravel hash for want of more genial farein a threadbare coat halfpolished boots a greasy hat anda dirty cravat while the plunderers of their happiness andproperty are driving by them in luxury enjoying theirpleasure by contrast with their victim and sneering at hismiseriesof all the vices which deform this metropolis and there arenot a few the most ruinous is that of rouge et noirgambling for that is practised in the day time and it is amatter of astonishment to think that it has remainedundisturbed by the law and hitherto unnoticed by the pressat this moment no less than twelve of these hells are opento the public in the noonday and no less than five or sixprofane the sabbath by their sinful practices althoughlondon has been time out of mind infested with the imps ofplay yet it was not until within these last ten or fifteenyears that they dared open their dens to the honest light ofday about that period or a very short time before rougeet noir was imported amongst other fashionable things fromfrance and to this game we are indebted for the practice ofgambling in the daylightit is impossible to put down the vice of gaming wholly andnot all the various enactments of the legislature against ithave succeeded but that the ruinous and infamous practiceof indulging that vice in the midst of crowded day should besuffered for upwards of sixteen years in the centre ofbritish society when it can easily be suppressed callsforth our wonder and gives a stronger proof to us that oursocieties for the suppression of vice c c are shadowswith a name when the hazard tables open it is at an hourwhen the respectable and controlled youths of london arewithin the walls of their homes few are abroad except themodern man of ton the rake the sot the robber and thevagabond and the dangers of gaming on these orders ofsociety is little indeed when compared with the banefuleffects of that vice upon the mercantile youth of london itis to this class and to the youth of the middling orders ofsociety that gaming is destructive and it is upon thesethat the rouge et noir tables cast the most fatal influenceyoung men of this order cannot in general be absent fromtheir families after midnight the hour when the nocturnalhells formerly yawned upon their victims but now theintroduction of rouge et noir has rendered the abominabletrack of play a morning and evening's lounge set forth inall the false glare which the artful proprietors can inventto deceive the thoughtless and thus it affordsopportunities and temptations to such youth almostirresistiblewhen the glittering of london pleasures first meets the eyeof a young man placed upon the road of a mercantile life orwhen he enters any of the multifarious departments in themachine of society which always lead the industrious andprudent to honourable emolument he too frequentlymisconceives the fashionable gamester's character andconfounds his crimes with elegant accomplishments the roadto pleasure is broad and the gates of these hells are opento him at hours when he can be absent and can indulge hiswhim without suspicion for at first he looks upon his newenjoyment but a mere whim which he can abandon at anymoment but how different is the proof he goes on his newmade wings carry him through a region of delight and hebelieves himself to possess the powers of the eagle stilllighter he ascends and the solid earth on which he formerlytrod in safety recedes immeasurably from his giddy eye atlength his wings prove wax they melt before the sun andthe victim of his own folly tumbles into the abyss ofdestructionit is no uncommon thing nay we will positively declare itto be a very frequent practice of these misled young menwhen they have been initiated and have the temporarycommand of money belonging to their employers to go to therouge et noir tables armed as they think withimpenetrable armour a large sum and in the hope ofprofiting to a certain amount risk that property the lossof which would be the loss of every thing dear to them insociety they believe from the greatness of the amount theypossess that they can command a small gain and not for amoment doubt they will be able to replace or return themoney entrusted to their care but little do they know thefickleness of luck and less do they suspect the odds andimposing roguery arrayed against them their first loss istrifling but they have to win that back iu addition totheir expected profits for this purpose they stake a largersum which if they lose increases their task and so onuntil the halffrantic victims see no hope but desperationand their remaining stock is placed upon the chance of asingle card the event closes and the man who yesterdayenjoyed the good opinion of the world and the esteem andconfidence of his friends today becomes the veriestoutcast of society these are common cases one of whichfor example we will describe as the facts occurred in theyear a clerk possessing the highest reputationbecame a frequenter of a rouge et noir table from thenature of his employment he had daily the command of largesums which for a short time he risked at playsuccessfully one day however he brought with him hisemployer's money to the amount of l the whole ofwhich in two days he lost we may judge of the unhappyyoung man's feelings by his subsequent conduct he wrote aconfession of the affair to the man he wronged retired to atavern and blew his brains outthese gamingtables open at halfpast twelve o'clockcontinue their orgies until five and recommence at seven inthe evening how many young men are passing their doors atthese hours with the property of others in their pocketsand what a temptation to risk it it would seem as if theseplaces were set up as shops designed chiefly for theaccommodation of midday dealers in illfortune as iflevelled directly at those men who cannot or will not spendtheir nights in gambling and how the proprietors contriveto escape detection and punishment is surprisingconsidering that the law affords ample means to put

havesustained but as this is no place for explanation we must look on andsay nothingby this time merrywell and mortimer were mingled in the throng at thetable sparkle was engaged in conversation with an old acquaintance aprofusion of money was flying about and a large heap or bank was placedin the centre all was anxiety and for a few moments no sound washeard but the awful numbers of the eventful dealer every countenancewas hushed in expectation and every eye was fixed upon the coming cardwhich should decide the fate of hundreds it was an awful moment toevery one engaged in the play but the pause was succeeded with a sortof harlequinade movement to a scene of confusion and uproar scarcely tobe conceivedthe appearance at the door of half a dozen persons armed with pistolsrushing past the guardians and bearing away all before them hadsuch an instantaneous effect upon the company that they all aroseas it were to receive them and the leader of the party threw himselfsuddenly upon the pile of banknotes in the centre of the table withintent to seize the whole bankconfusion and dismay were now visibly depicted on every countenance forsome actuated by desperation at the prospect of ruin and others by theurgings of avarice determined to have a scramble for the notes whichthey commenced most furiously each one securing as much as he could tohimself there was tumbling and tossing and pulling and shoving mouthsstuffed with hundreds hundreds of mouths that were supperless andlikely to continue so unless they could now make sure of somethingbank paper was literally going for nothing however the pistols beingthe most powerful the armed forces succeeded in seizing the greatestshare of the stock and a negative sort of silence was at lengthrestored the party was materially decreased for seeing they werebetrayed every one after an endeavour to secure a share of the spoildeemed it necessary to make good his retreat and among the restour party who had not interfered with the play or assisted in theentertainment soon found themselves in the streetegad said sparkle i think we are in luck to escape so easilywe might have been compelled to make our appearance at bow streettomorrow an occurrence i would studiously avoidwell done old steady said tom it is not long you know since youwas there after a night's lodging in the neighbourhoodthat was under very different circumstances continued sparkle indefence of a woman i would risk my life at any time but i would byno means incur the imputation of being a gambler it is a character iabhor i have before said i would never venture into those dens againto herd with swindlers of all descriptionsthey all seem gay fellows too said bobyes replied sparkle but the character and conduct of a young manhas ere now been altered in one night the evil effects produced byinitiation to those hells are incalculablemoralizing at midnight said tom an excellent title for a volumesparkling contemplationsto be written by the hon tom dashall or the merry devil ofpiccadilly was the replyhuzza said merrywell if this is the case our time will not be lostin this excursion did you hear that lord has been compelled to putdown his establishment in consequence of his losses at play pray don'tforget to mention that in the worktis no new thing continued sparkle for lords of the present daysince i believe there are few of the nobility who are not either greeksor pigeons indeed the list of visitors to these places contains namesof many persons who should set better examples to the humbler classes ofthe community for the unfortunate results of this too fatal propensityto parents and society have been severely felt among many instanceson record a very interesting one is related of a young subaltern in aregiment of cavalry who by successive losses was reduced to such astate of distress as to form the desperate resolution of trying theroad in a moment of agony he accidentally met with an opportunitywhich seemed to favour his design having learned that a certainbaronet recently returned from india with abundance of wealth had laidit out on landed estates in england and that he would on a certain daycross the country with a large sum of money after collecting his rentshe laid his plan for a meeting on a retired spot and succeeded instopping the carriage your money or your life said he presentinghis pistol with a trembling hand the baronet perceiving there was asort of gentlemanly air about him which indicated something more thanmight be calculated on in the character of a highwayman presented himwith his purse a watch and a valuable diamond ring remarking hecould not help conceiving that he was unaccustomed to the trade andthat it was most desirable he should abandon it for ever theyoung officer though considerably confused and embarrassed by thisobservation was not to be disappointed of his booty returned thisproperty and demanded the larger sum which for safety had beenconcealed in the bottom of the carriage the manner however in whichthis was done only served to confirm the suspicions of the baronetwhich he could not help expressing as he acknowledged the accuracy ofthe highwayman's information and produced the property observing hewas sure that circumstances of no common kind could have impelledhim to this flagrant breach of the laws he asked as a favour that hewould grant him an interview at some future period pledging his honourthat he should have no occasion to repent such a singular mark ofconfidencethe officer replied that he had and he felt he could with safetytrust both his life and his honour in the veracity of sir andappointed a meeting at the london coffee house lydgate hill onlystipulating that at such meeting both parties were to be unattendedas the day of meeting approached the baronet thought seriously of thesolicited rencontre and after enjoining perfect secresy on the part ofhis friend col entreated him to be his companion the colonellaughed at the idea that any man who had robbed another should soindiscreetly place his life in his hands had no conception of hiskeeping his appointment and solemnly assured the baronet that he wouldin no case divulge who or what he was that he might become acquaintedwiththe colonel ridiculed his friend's credulity as they entered the houseand were shewn to a private room the appointed hour was eight in theevening and as the clock of st paul's struck a gentleman inquiringfor sir was shewn into the room wine was ordered and for an houra general conversation on the popular topics of the day ensued when thegentleman evidently under deeply impressed feelings of embarrassmentand disappointment in which the colonel seemed to partake arose andpolitely took his leave well said the baronet what think you of my highwayman now am inot right is he not a gentleman and this is the robber is it sir said the colonel be assuredhe shall swing for it why sir i know him well he is a in my ownregimenthold said the baronet don't be rash remember the solemn promiseyou have given and do not deceive me i hold you bound to me and willnot permit you to break your engagement i have better objects in viewthan the death of a fellowcreaturehe then requested to be informed of the general tenor of the youngman's conduct which he found to be excellent and that he was anindefatigable officer indeed said the colonel it would give me thegreatest pain to lose him an incomparably affectionate husbandand father he has but one vice to which may be attributed hisdestruction viz his inordinate passion for gaming but i cannot feeljustified in screening so flagrant an offender the law must take itscoursemoderate your indignation said the worthy baronet assuming a moreserious tone and remember you must be personalty answerable to me forany disclosure you may think proper to make and that inasmuch as youinjure him you must injure me you have already given him so high acharacter in every respect but one that i must interest you furtherin his behalf and beg you to assist me in my endeavours to reclaiminstead of punishing himthe colonel was surprised but the baronet was inflexible in vainhe urged that the magnitude of the crime utterly precluded such aproceeding it must be done said the baronet it shall be done leave all theconsequences to me he has now left us in extreme though suppressedagitation there is no time to lose fly to save himthe colonel expressed his readiness to try the experiment then said the baronet follow him immediately assure him ofmy forgiveness and that if he will pledge his word to forsake thisdangerous vice what he has already obtained he may hold as a gift andi will add whatever may be necessary to extricate him from any temporaryembarrassmentit was an important embassy life or death was to be decided by it thecolonel took his departure certain of finding him at home taking leaveof his family and reaching his habitation a short time after hisarrival witnessed a scene of misery which although he had partlyanticipated he could not have conceived he found him surrounded byhis wife and children in an agony of desperation and despairwhen he entered the apartment the poor culprit convinced by thepresence of his colonel that all was lost fell on his knees andsupplicated if possible that his fame not his life might be spared forthe sake of his afflicted but innocent and injured family language hasno power to describe the surprise and consternation with which after asevere lecture he received the joyful intelligence of whichhis colonel was the bearer he returned with his commanding officerto square where he was received by the baronet as a repentantfriend and has lived to repair his error and become deservedlydistinguished as an ornament to society civil and religious as well asmilitarythat must be truly gratifying to the worthy baronetcy said tomno doubt of it continued sparkle it must be a source of continuedpleasure to find his labours have had so beneficial a result having inall probability saved a whole family from destruction surely it may besaid thatamong the idiot pranks of

explaining tothose around him and expostulating with the first aggressor uponthe impropriety of his conduct the shouts of the multitude at thecourageous proceedings of the porter and the hooting at

directed the eye of his cousinto the best and most masterly productions in the collection andwhose attention was more particularly drawn to the pictures thoughoccasionally devoted to the inspection of a set of wellformed featuresor a delicately turned ancle was much pleased to find bob so busy inenquiry and observationwe have here said tom a combination of the finest specimens in theart of painting laid open annually for public inspection music poetryand painting have always been held in high estimation by those whomae speech was certainly a bold one and onewhich the gentleman would have found some difficulty inestablishing if however the learned gentleman hadsubstituted the word law for blasphemy he would have beenmuch nearer the truthof all the evils with which this country is afflicted thatof an excessive passion for law is the greatest the sumpaid annually in taxes is nothing to that which is spent inlitigation go into our courts of justice and you willoften see sixty or seventy lawyers at a time follow themhome and you will find that they are residing in thefashionable parts of the town and living in the mostexpensive manner look at the lists of the two houses ofparliament and you will find lawyers predominate in thehouse of commons and in the upper house more peers whoowe their origin to the law than have sprung from the armyand navy united there is scarcely a street of anyrespectability without an attorney not to mention thenumbers that are congregated in the inns of court in londonalone we are told there are nearly three thousandcertificated attornies and in the country they are numerousin proportionwhile on the subject of lawyers we shall add a fewunconnected anecdotes which will exhibit the differencebetween times past and presentin the rolls of parliament for the year there is apetition from two counties in england stating that thenumber of attornies had lately increased from sixteen totwentyfour whereby the peace of those counties had beengreatly interrupted by suits and it was prayed that itmight be ordained that there should only be six attorniesfor the county of norfolk the same number for suffolk andtwo for the city of norwichthe profits of the law have also increased in proportion wenow frequently hear of gentlemen at the bar making ten orfifteen thousand pounds a year by their practice and asolicitor in one single suit the trial of warren hastingsis said to have gained no less than thirtyfive thousandpounds how different three centuries ago when roper inhis life of sir thomas more informs us that though he wasan advocate of the greatest eminence and in full businessyet he did not by his profession make above four hundredpounds per annum there is however a common tradition onthe other hand that sir edward coke's gains at the latterend of this century equalled those of a modern attorneygeneral and by lord bacon's works it appears that he madel per annum whilst in this office brownlow's profitslikewise one of the promontories during the reign ofqueen elizabeth were l per annum and he used to closethe profits of the year with a laus ceo and when theyhappened to be extraordinary maxima laus ceo there is no person we believe who is acquainted with theimportant duties of the judges or the laborious nature oftheir office will think that they are too amplyremunerated and it is not a little remarkable that whenlaw and lawyers have increased so prodigiously the numberof the judges is still the same fortescue in thededication of his work de claudius legum anglaise to princeedward says that the judges were not accustomed to sit morethan three hours in a day that is from eight o'clock inthe morning until eleven they passed the remainder of theday in studying the laws and reading the holy scripturescarte supposes that the great reason for the lawyerspushing in shoals to become members of parliament arosefrom their desire to receive the wages then paid them bytheir constituents by an act of the th of henry ivlawyers were excluded from parliament not from a contemptof the common law itself but the professors of it who atthis time being auditors to men of property received anannual stipend pro connie immense et impended andwere treated as retainers in maddox's form anglican thereis a form of a retainer during his life of john de thorpas counsel to the earl of westmoreland and it appears bythe household book of algerian fifth earl ofnorthumberland that in the beginning of the reign of henrythe eighth there was in that family a regularestablishment for two counsellors and their servantsa proclamation was issued on the th of november in thetwentieth year of the reign of james i in which the votersfor members of parliament are directed not to choosecurious and wrangling lawyers who may seek reputation bystirring needless questionsa strong prejudice was at this time excited against lawyersin aleyn's henry viii london we have the followingphilippic against thema

templarss in fleetstreet in the thirteenth century frequentlyentertained the king the pope's nuncio foreign ambassadors and othergreat personagesit is now divided into two societies of students called

reason of the thing they examine students as to theirproficiency in the knowledge of the law and call candidates to the baror reject them at pleasure and without appeal it is pretty well knownthat students in some cases eat their way to the bar in which there canbe no great harm because their clients will take the liberty afterwardsof judging how far they have otherwise qualified themselves but everyman that eats in those societies should be called or the rejectionshould be founded solely on his ignorance of the law and should besubject to an appeal to a higher jurisdiction otherwise the power ofthe benchers may be exercised on private or party motivesthe expence of going through the course of these societies is notgreat in the inner temple a student pays on admission for the fees ofthe society l s d which with other customary charges amounts tol s a duty is also paid to the king which is high terms may be keptfor about s per week and in fact students may dine at a cheaperrate

porter or cooks without fee orintroduction our time is short now or we would take a peep you musttherefore content yourself with my descriptionthe temple is an irregular building in fleetstreet are two entrancesone to the inner and the other to the middle temple the latter has afront in the manner of indigo jones of brick ornamented with four largestone pilastres of the ionic order with a pediment it is too narrowand being lofty wants proportion the passage to which it leadsalthough designed for carriages is narrow inconvenient and meanthe garden of the inner temple is not only a most happy situation butis laid out with great taste and kept in perfect order itis chiefly covered with green sward which is pleasing to the eyeespecially in a city and is most agreeable to walk on it lies as youperceive along the river is of great extent and has a spaciousgravel walk or terrace on the bank of the thames it forms a crowdedpromenade in summer and at such times is an interesting spotthe middle temple has a garden but much smaller and not soadvantageously situatedthe hall of the middle temple is a spacious and elegant room in itsstyle many great feasts have been given in it in old times it is wellworth a visitthe inner temple hall is comparatively small but is a fine room it isornamented with the portraits of several of the judges before thishall is a broad paved terrace forming an excellent promenade when thegardens are not sufficiently drythere are two good libraries belonging to these societies open tostudents and to others on application to the librarian from ten in themorning till one and in the afternoon from two till sixthe temple church belongs in common to the two societies the knightstemplarss built their church on this site which was destroyed and thepresent edifice was erected by the knights hospitallers it is in thenorman style of architecture and has three aisles running east andwest and two cross aisles at the western end is a spacious roundtower the inside of which forms an elegant and singular entrance intothe church from which it is not separated by close walls but merely byarches the whole edifice within has an uncommon and noble aspect theroof of the church is supported by slight pillars of sussex marble andthere are three windows at each side adorned with small pillars of thesame marble the entire floor is of flags of black and white marblethe roof of the tower is supported with six pillars having an upper andlower range of small arches except on the eastern side opening intothe church the length of the church is eightythree feet the breadthsixty and the height thirtyfour the height of the inside of the toweris fortyeight feet and its diameter on the floor fiftyonein the porch or tower are the tombs of eleven knights templarss eightof them have the figures of armed knights on them three of thembeing the tombs of so many earls of pembroke the organ of this churchis one of the finest in the worldthe temple church is open for divine service every day at eleveno'clock in the morning and at four in the afternoon there are fourentrances into the temple besides those in fleetstreet and it isa thoroughfare during the day but the gates are shut at night thegardens are open to the public in summer it is a place of much businessand constant traffic i assure youi perceive it said bob by the number of persons passing andrepassing every one apparently animated and impelled by some businessof importanceyes it is something like a steamboiler by which a considerableportion of the engines of the law are kept in motion they can alarm andallay according to the pockets of their customers or the sagacity whichthey are able to discover in their heads there are perhaps as manyquacks in this profession as in any other continued tom as theyregained fleetstreet when perceiving it was half past four o'clock byst dunstan's but we must now make the best of our way or we may becut out of the good things of this globe what are so many persons collected together here for enquired bobmerely to witness a little of ingenious machinery keep your eye on thetwo figures in the front of the church with clubs in their handsi do said bob but there does not appear to me to be any thing veryremarkable about themhe scarcely uttered the words when he observed that these figuresstruck their clubs upon the bells which hung between them to denote thetime of daythese figures said tom and the circumstance of giving them motionevery fifteen minutes by the movements of the clock have attracted agreat deal of notice particularly among persons from the country andat almost every quarter of an hour throughout the day they are honouredwith spectators the church itself is very ancient and has beenrecently beautified the bell thunders whose abilities you have justhad a specimen of have been standing there ever since the year it is hard service said bob and they must certainly deserve apension from government more than many of the automatons who arenow in the enjoyment of the national bountiesyou are right enough said a translator of soles who had overheardbob's last remark with a pair of old shoes under his arm and d nme if i would give a pair of crazy crab shells without vamp orwheat for the whole boiling of em there is not one on em worth abloody jemmyupon hearing this from the political cobbler a disturbed sort of shoutwas uttered by the surrounding spectators who had rather increased thandiminished in number to hear the observations of the leathernlongedorator when tom giving his cousin a significant pinch of the armimpelled him forward and left them to the enjoyment of their humourpolitical observations are always bad in the street said tom it isa subject upon which scarcely any two persons agree distinctly old waxand bristles is about three sheets in the wind and no doubt thereare enough to take advantage of any persons stopping at this time of thedaywhat have we here said bob who observed a concourse of peoplesurrounding the end of fetter laneonly a couple more of striking figures replied tom almost asintelligent as those we have just seen translator of soles a disciple of st crispin alias acobbler who can botch up old shoes so as to have theappearance of being almost new and who is principallyengaged in his laudable occupation by the secondhand booksellersof field lane turn stile c for the purpose ofturning an honest penny ie to deceive poor purchasers crabshells a cant term for shoes whole boding of em the whole kit of em c means thewhole party bloody jemmy a cant term for a sheep's head three sheets in the wind a cant phrase intending toexplain that a person is more than half drunk this was a hint well given by dashall for in the presenttimes it is scarcely possible to be aware of the numerousdepredations that are committed in the streets of themetropolis in open daylight and it is a wellknown factthat fleet street being one of the leading thoroughfaresis at almost all times infested with loose characters ofevery description from the welldressed sharpers who hoverround the entrances to billiardtables to mark new comersand give information to the pals in waiting somewherewithin call and who are called macesto the wily duffersor buffers willing to sell extraordinary bargains and theclyfaker or pickpocketbob bustled forward and looking down the lane perceived twowatchmen one on each side the street bearing poles with black boardsinscribed in white letters beware of bad houses and a lanternhanging to eachthese said tom are not decoy ducks but scare crows at least theyare intended for such whether their appearance does not operate as muchone way as it does the other is i believe a matter of doubtbeware of bad houses said bob i don't exactly see the objectno perhaps not continued his cousin but i will tell you this is amethod which the churchwardens of parishes sometimes take of shamingthe papa or fie fie ladies from their residences or at least ofdiscovering their visitors but i am half inclined to think that ninetimes out of ten the contrary effect is produced for these men who arestationed as warnings to avoid are easily to be blinded by the gay andgallant youths who have an inclination to obtain an admission tothe fair cyprians besides which if the first inhabitants are reallyinduced to quit the house is quickly occupied by similar game andthe circumstance of the burning out as it is termed serves as adirectionpost to new visitors so that no real good is eventuallyeffectedcome we had

meet topore over the news of the day or search the records of past timesan excellent way of passing an hour said bob and a proof of thestudied attention which is paid not only to the comforts and convenienceof their customers but also to their instructionyou are right replied tom in london every man has an opportunityof living according to his wishes and the powers of his pockethe may dive like frederick random into a cellar and fill his belly forfour pence or regale himself with the more exquisite delicacies of thelondon tavern at a guinea while the moderate tradesman can be suppliedat

must replenishthe hint was no sooner given than the defect was remedied and afteranother glassking james vi on his arrival in london said he was waited on bya spanish ambassador a man of some erudition but who had strangelyincorporated with his learning a whimsical notion that every countryought to have a school in which a certain order of men should be taughtto interpret signs and that the most expert in this department oughtto be dignified with the title of professor of signs if this plan wereadopted he contended that most of the difficulties arising from theambiguity of language and the imperfect acquaintance which people ofone nation had with the tongue of another would be done away signs heargued arose from the dictates of nature and as they were the samein every country there could be no danger of their being misunderstoodfull of this project the ambassador was lamenting one day beforethe king that the nations of europe were wholly destitute of this granddesideratum and he strongly recommended the establishment of a collegefounded upon the simple principles he had suggested the king eitherto humour this quixotic foible or to gratify his own ambition at theexpense of truth observed in reply why sir i have a professorof signs in one of the northernmost colleges in my dominions butthe distance is perhaps six hundred miles so that it will beimpracticable for you to have an interview with him pleased with thisunexpected information the ambassador exclaimed if it had been sixhundred leagues i would go to see him and i am determined to set outin the course of three or four days the king who now perceived thathe had committed himself endeavoured to divert him from his purposebut finding this impossible he immediately caused letters to bewritten to the college stating the case as it really stood and desiredthe professors to get rid of the ambassador in the best manner they wereable without exposing their sovereign disconcerted at this strange andunexpected message the professors scarcely knew how to proceed theyhowever at length thought to put off their august visitant by sayingthat the professor of signs was not at home and that his returnwould be very uncertain having thus fabricated the story they madepreparations to receive the illustrious stranger who keeping his wordin due time reached their abode on his arrival being introduced withbecoming solemnity he began to enquire who among them had the honourof being professor of signs he was told in reply that neither ofthem had that exalted honour but the learned gentleman after whomhe enquired was gone into the highlands that they conceived his staywould be considerable but that no one among them could even conjecturethe period of his return i will wait his coming replied theambassador if it be twelve monthsfinding him thus determined and fearing from the journey he hadalready undertaken that he might be as good as his word the learnedprofessors had recourse to another stratagem to this they foundthemselves driven by the apprehension that they must entertain him aslong as he chose to tarry and in case he should unfortunately weary outtheir patience the whole affair must terminate in a discovery ofthe fraud they knew a butcher who had been in the habit of serving thecolleges occasionally with meat this man they thought with a littleinstruction might serve their purpose he was however blind with oneeye but he had much drollery and impudence about him and very wellknew how to conduct any farce to which his abilities were competenton sending for geordy for that was the butcher's name theycommunicated to him the tale and instructing him in the part he was toact he readily undertook to become professor of signs especially as hewas not to speak one word in the ambassador's presence on any pretencewhatever having made these arrangements it was formally announced tothe ambassador that the professor would be in town in the course ofa few days when he might expect a silent interview pleased withthis information the learned foreigner thought that he would put hisabilities at once to the test by introducing into his dumb languagesome subject that should be at once difficult interesting andimportant when the day of interview arrived geordy was cleaned updecorated with a large bushy wig and covered over with a singular gownin every respect becoming his station he was then seated in a chairof state in one of their large rooms while the ambassador and thetrembling professors waited in an adjoining apartmentit was at length announced that the learned professor of signs wasready to receive his excellency who on entering the room was struckwith astonishment at his venerable and dignified appearance as none ofthe professors would presume to enter to witness the interview undera pretence of delicacy but in reality for fear that their presencemight have some effect upon the risible muscles of geordy's countenancethey waited with inconceivable anxiety the result of this strangeadventure upon which depended their own credit that of the king andin some degree the honour of the nationas this was an interview of signs the ambassador began with geordyby holding up one of his fingers geordy replied by holding up two theambassador then held up three geordy answered by clenching his fistand looking sternly the ambassador then took an orange from his pocketand held it up geordy returned the compliment by taking from hispocket a piece of a barley cake which he exhibited in a similarmanner the ambassador satisfied with the vast attainments of thelearned professor then bowed before him with profound reverence andretired on rejoining the agitated professors they fearfully began toenquire what his excellency thought of their learned brother he isa perfect miracle replied the ambassador his worth is not to bepurchased by the wealth of half the indies may we presume to descendto particulars returned the professors who now began to thinkthemselves somewhat out of danger gentlemen said the ambassadorwhen i first entered into his presence i held up one finger to denotethat there is one god he then held up two signifying that the fathershould not be divided from the son i then held up three intimatingthat i believed in father son and holy ghost he then clenched hisfist and looking sternly at me signified that these three areone and that he would defy me either to separate them or to makeadditions i then took out an orange from my pocket and held it up toshow the goodness of god and to signify that he gives to his creaturesnot only the necessaries but even the luxuries of life then to myutter astonishment this wonderful man took from his pocket a piece ofbread thus assuring me that this was the staff of life and was to bepreferred to all the luxuries in the world being thus satisfied withhis proficiency and great attainments in this science i silentlywithdrew to reflect upon what i had witnessed diverted with thesuccess of their stratagem the professors continued to entertain theirvisitor until he thought prudent to withdraw no sooner had he retiredthan the opportunity was seized to learn from geordy in what manner hehad proceeded to give the ambassador such wonderful satisfaction theybeing at a loss to conceive how he could have caught his ideas withso much promptitude and have replied to them with proportionablereadiness but that one story might not borrow any features fromthe other they concealed from geordy all they had learned from theambassador and desiring him to begin with his relation he proceeded inthe following manner when the rascal came into the room after gazingat me a little what do you think gentlemen that he did he held upone finger as much as to say you have only one eye i then held uptwo to let him know that my one eye was as good as both ofhis he then held up three as much as to say we have only three eyesbetween us this was so provoking that i bent my fist at the scoundreland had it not been for your sakes i should certainly have risen fromthe chair pulled off my wig and gown and taught

publicationhave deservedly entitled it to rank high among the jeuesprit productions of this lively age to describe it wereimpossible to enjoy it must be to possess it but for theinformation of such of our readers as are remote from themetropolis it may perhaps be necessary to give somethinglike a key of explanation to its title a certain learnedgentleman formerly the editor of the times said now to

exhilaration and returning in half an hourthis proposition was cordially agreed to by all except tallyhoho whoseattention was engrossed by a large collection of caricatures whichlay exposed in a portfolio on the table beneath the rostrum theirresistible broad humour of the subjects had taken fast hold of hisrisible muscles and in turning them over one after the other he foundit difficult to part with such a rich fund of humour and still more soto stifle the violent emotion it excited at length clapping his handsto his sides he gave full vent to the impulse in a horselaugh from apair of truly stentorian lungs and was by main force dragged out by hiscompanionswhile seated in the comfortable enjoyment of their nips of ale sparklewith his usual vivacity began an elucidation of the subjects theyhad just left the collection of caricatures said he which isconsidered the largest in london are mostly from the pencil of thatselftaught artist the late george woodward and display not

who emulate the publicstreets of this overgrown and still increasing metropolis and itsprincipal avenues are continually pestered with impudent impostors ofboth sexes soliciting charity men and women

to be their honest andinvariable signals can be and are counterfeited limbs which enjoy thefair proportion of nature are distorted to work upon humanity fitsare feigned and wounds manufactured rags

undoubtedly to be met with thoughrarely to be found it requires a being hackneyed in the ways of men orhaving at least some knowledge of the town to be able to discriminatethe party deserving of benevolence buta begging they will go will goand a begging they will gothe chief cause assigned by some for the innumerable classes ofmendicants that infest our streets is a sort of innate principle ofindependence and love of liberty however it must be apparent that theydo not like to work and to beg they are not ashamed they arewith very few exceptions lazy and impudent and then what iscollected from the humane but deluded passengers is of course expendedat their festivals in broad street st giles's or some other equallyelegant and appropriate part of the town to which we shall at an

so much a sort of trade that parents have beenknown to give their daughters or sons the begging of certain streets inthe metropolis as marriage portions and some years ago some scoundrelswere in the practice of visiting the outskirts of the town in sailors'dresses pretending to be dumb and producing written papers statingthat their tongues had been cut out by the algerine by which meansthey

impositions practised upon the public areso numerous that volumes might be filled by detailing thearts that have been and are resorted to by mendicants andthe records of the society alluded to would furnishinstances that might almost stagger the belief of the mostcredulous the life of the infamous vaux exhibits numerousinstances in which he obtained money under genteelprofessions by going about

their approbation by a universal shout of applauseall went on well songs toasts and sentiments punch puns andwitticisms were handed about in abundance in the mean time theroom began to wear an

was immediately opened to the mind of dashall he was nonovice to the varieties of character generally to be found within itswalls and he anticipated an opportunity of imparting considerableinformation to his cousin though somewhat clogg'd by his companionsbeing known however at the bar he found no difficulty in providing themwith beds which being accomplishednow said tom for a new scene in real

ship with him in the morning and apparentlywell guarded by a female on each side in another was a weatherbeatenfisherman in a guernsey frock and a thick woollen nightcap whohaving just arrived with a cargo of fish was toiling away time tillthe commencement of the market with a pipe and a pint by whose side wasseated a large newfoundland dog whose gravity of countenance formed anexcellent contrast with that of a man who was entertaining the fishermanwith a history of his adventures through the day and who in return wasallowed to participate in the repeatedly filled pint a waterman inhis coat and badge ready for a customer and two women each having ashallow basket for the purpose of supplying themselves with fish at thefirst market for the next day's salegoing to gravesend gentlemen

during the conversation in the other room which hadoccasionally been interrupted by the snores of the sleepy sailor thegiggling of the girls who appeared to have him in charge and a growlfrom the dog been particularly attentive to the narration of thisadventure remarked that there was a peculiarity of dialect introducedwhich to a person coming out of the country would have been whollyunintelligibleyes replied tom almost every trade and every calling of which thenumerous inhabitants of this overgrown town is composed has a languageof its own differing as widely from each other as those of provincialsnor is this less observable in high life where every one seems at timesto aim at rendering himself conspicuous for some extraordinary mode ofexpression but come i perceive the morning is shedding itsrays upon us and we shall be able to take a survey of the more generalvisitors to this place of extensive utility and resort already you mayhear the rumbling of carts in thames street and the shrill voice of thefishwives who are preparing for a day's work which they will nearlyfinish before twothirds of the population leave their pillows thismarket which is principally supplied by fishing smacks and boats comingfrom the sea up the river thames and partly by land carriage from everydistance within the limits of england and part of wales is open everymorning at daylight and supplies the retailers for some miles roundthe metropolis the regular shopkeepers come here in carts to purchaseof what is called the fish salesman who stands as it were between thefisherman who brings his cargo to market and the retailer but there areinnumerable hawkers of fish through the streets who come and purchasefor themselves at first hand particularly of mackarel herringssprats lobsters shrimps flounders soles c and also of codand salmon when in season and at a moderate rate composing anheterogeneous group of persons and characters not easily to be met withelsewhere then said bob there is a certainty of high andexalted entertainment i should suppose the supply of fish is veryconsiderablethe quantity of fish consumed replied tom in london iscomparatively small fish being excessively dear in general and thisis perhaps the most culpable defect in the supply of the capitalconsidering that the rivers of great britain and the seas round hercoast teem with that food there are on an average about cargoesof fish of tons each brought to billingsgate and about tonsby land carriage making a total of about tons and the streetvenders form a sample of low life in all its situationsin such indexes although smallto their subsequent volumes there is seenthe baby figure of the giant massof things to come at largeand the language you have already heard forms a part of what may betermed cockneyismcockneyism said bob with an inquisitiveness in his countenance yes continued tom cockney is universally known to be thecontemptuous appellation given to an uneducated native of londonbrought into life within the sound of bow bell pert and conceitedyet truly ignorant they generally discover themselves by their mode ofspeech notwithstanding they have frequent opportunities of hearing thebest language the cause i apprehend is a carelessness of every thingbut the accumulation of money which is considered so important withthem that they seem at all times to be in eager pursuit of ito plutus god of gold thine aid impartteach me to catch the moneycatching artor sly mercurial pilfering god of oldthy lesser mysteries

theyare all alivebob laughed at his cousin's specimens of cockney language and theysallied forth to make further observationsit was now a fine morning the sun shone with resplendent lustre uponall around them and danced in playful dimples on the sportive thamesthere was however but little opportunity at the moment for them tocontemplate subjects of this sort their eyes and ears being whollyattracted by the passing and repassing of the persons desirous to sellor supply themselves with fish thames street was almost blocked up withcarts and the hallooing and bawling of the different drivers loadingor unloading formed an occasional symphony to the continual humof those who were moving in all directions to and from the marketby yer leaf said a sturdy built fellow sweating under a load of fishwhich appeared to press him almost down what the devil do you stand inthe way forbob in stepping on one side to make room for this man to passunfortunately trod upon the toe of an hibernian lady who was bearingaway a large basket of shrimps alive and at the same time gave her armso forcible a jerk with his elbow as disengaged her hand from the loadby which means the whole cargo was overturned smack into the bosom of asmartly dressed youth in white ducks who was conducting some ladieson board one of the gravesend boats the confusion that followed isscarcely to be conceived the agitation of tale who at hearing thevociferated lamentations of the irish woman the spluttering of thedisconcerted dandy the declaration of the owner of the shrimps thatso help her god he should pay for her property the loud laughter ofthose around them who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the wholeparty and the shrimps hopping and jumping about amid the dirt and slushof the pavement while the ladies were hunting those which had falleninto the bosom of their conductor formed a scene altogether whichin spite of the confusion of his cousin almost convulsed the hon tomdashall with laughter and which served but to increase the rancour ofthe owner of the shrimps and the poor toesuffering irishwoman theexecrations of the dandy gentleman and his ladies and the miseries ofpoor bob to escape from which he gave the hibernian and her employerenough to purchase plaster for the one and a fresh cargo for the otherand seizing tom by the arm dragged him away from the scene of hismisfortunes in fisheryillustration pages real life at billingsgatetheir progress however was presently impeded by a sudden scream whichappeared to come from a female and drew together almost all the peopleon the spot it seemed as if it had been a preconceived signal for ageneral muster and it was quickly ascertained that fiftycuffs were theorder of the day by the vociferations of the spectators and the loudacclamations of go it poll pitch it into her mill her snatched veildone sail all pluck game to the backbone peppermint herupperstory and grapple her knowledgebox d n my eyes but

took up a favourable position for observation at the cornerof a fishstall where they could quietly witness the combatants andtake a general survey of the proceedingsnow said tom here is a lark for you a female fightfine salmon or cod gentlemen said an elderly woman i wish i couldtempt you to be customerswell said bob they are at it in good earnesto yes said the woman we always have it in real earnest no sham iwish poll may serve her out for sall is a d d saucy b h atall timesand what have they quarrelled about inquired dashalljealousy sir nothing else that there man in the nightcap with

beveragewhich they could perceive was in high reputation by those around themthe effluvia of the fish the fumes of tobacco and the revivingscent of the ginbottle rendered their olfactory salutations trulydelightful nor could they escape the fishwife without becomingparticipators in the half pint of blue ruincome said tom we will now stroll a little further and take asurvey of the street but first we will give a look herethis said he is the custom house a splendid building recentlyerected in consequence of the old one being demolished by fire in it is indeed replied bob admiring the south frontwhich is executed in portland stonedo you observe continued tom the central compartment whichcomprises what is called the long room and which we will visitpresently is quite plain except the attic which is elegantlyornamented that altorelievo contains allegorical representations ofthe arts and sciences as connected with and promoting the commerceand industry of the nation that to the west a representation ofthe costume and character of the various nations with whom we holdintercourse in our commercial relations in the centre under the largemassive dialplate are inscribed in large bronze letters the names ofthe founders and the date of its erection the figures which supportthe dial in a recumbent position are emblematical of industry andplenty that bold projection in the centre gives a suitable characterto the king's warehouse and forms an appropriate support to theimperial arms upheld by the attributes of ocean and commercebob gazed with admiration and delight on this truly admirable andextensive pile of national architecture the gentle breeze from theriver the occasional dash of the oar and the activity which appearedon board the different vessels together with the view of london bridgeon one side over which he could perceive pedestrians and vehiclesof various kinds passing and repassing and the tower on the otherconspired to heighten and give a most imposing effect to the scenethe designs said tallyhoho are truly creditable to the taste andscience of the architectand this quay in front is intended to be enlarged by filling up a partof the river besides which a new wall and quay are to be formed fromthe tower to billingsgate and numerous other improvements are projectedin the contiguous streets and lanes not before it is necessary wasthe reply it would be impossible continued dashall to visit allthe apartments this building contains we will however have a lookat the long room and as we proceed i will endeavour to give you somefurther information we are now entering the east wing which is acounterpart of that on the west having like this a grand staircasewith a double flight of steps which conduct to a lobby at each endof the long room lighted by these vertical lanternlights theceilings being perforated in square compartments and glazed theselobbies serve to check the great draughts of air which would otherwiseflow through the room if it opened directly from the staircasethey now entered the long room the imposing appearance of which had itsdue effect upon tallyhohobless me cried he in a state of ecstasy this is a room to boast ofindeedyes replied his cousin there is not such another room in europe itis feet long by wide and proportionably high divided intothree compartments by these eight massive pillars from which as youperceive spring the three domes which are so richly ornamented andventilated through the centre of eachand all of stone inquired bobnot exactly so was the reply the floor excepting the situationof the officers and clerks is of stone but the walls and ceilings aredrawn out and tinted in imitationand what are these antique pedestals for merely ornamentstom was pleased at this inquiry and with a smile of satisfactionreplied no these pedestals do double duty and are something likewhat the rural poet goldsmith describes in his deserted villagethe chest contriv'd a double debt to paya bed by night a chest of drawers by daythese are ornamental during the summer but useful in the winter theycontain fireplaces completely hid from viewfireplaces reechoed bobyes continued his cousin the smoke descending passes through thepiers on each side and by their means a sufficient warmth is at alltimes kept up in the roomthat is a capital contrivance said tallyhohothen to prevent the possibility of sustaining any serious injury fromfire on the ground one and two pair stories the communication is cutoffby means of iron doors which run on wheels in chase in the centreof the walls and are moved backward and forward by a windlasswhich doors are closed every evening and would effectually preventa communication beyond their boundaries fireproof rooms also asrepositories for valuable books and papers are provided on eachfloor where the important documents of the establishment are depositedevery evening and removed in trunks to the respective offices thereare in all rooms devoted to various

entries of which either for paymentof duties warehousing or subsequent exportation are all passed withthe respective officers in this room the business of the customs ismanaged by nine commissioners whose jurisdiction extends over allparts of england we will now pass out at the west wing adjourn to yontavern refresh and refit and after which a further walkwith all my heart said tallyhohowhat ho

prepare us some breakfast with all speed but no fish mindthatthe landlord bowed assent to his honourable customer and by the timethey were ready their orders were complied withpray inquired dashall of the obliging landlord who came in to ask ifthey were supplied with all they wished for did you ever recover anythingfrom that dashing blade that so obligingly ordered his dinnerherenever got a halfpenny no no he was not one of those sort ofgentry nor do i ever wish to see such again in my housethis was uttered in a tone of discontent which evidently shewed he hadno relish for the conversationdashall could not refrain from laughter upon perceiving which thelandlord withdrew with a loud slam of the door and left his customersto enjoy their mirthwhat are you laughing at cried bobwhy continued his cousinthere was as fame reports in days of yoreat least some fifty years ago or morea pleasant wight on town and there are many pleasant fellows now to be met with but youshall have the tale as i had it this house has been celebrated forfurnishing excellent dinners and the cookery of fish in particularconsequently it has been the resort of the bucks the bloods and thedashing swells of the town and i myself have been well entertainedhere it will therefore not be wondered at that its accommodationsshould attract the notice of a sharper whose name and character werewell known but who was in person a total stranger to the unsuspectinglandlord whom however he did not fail to visitcalling one afternoon for the purpose of seeing how the land lay inhigh twig and fashionably dressed he was supplied with a bothered into a spaciousapartmentparticularly elegant being unincumbered the ceilingfinished in a superior style and decorated with paintings of the lateking and queen james the second lord sandwich lord howe and mrpitt here bob wandered from portrait to portrait examining thefeatures and character of each and admiring the skill and ability ofthe artists at the upper end of the room he was additionally pleasedto find a large painting containing a group of about twentyfour ofthe elder brethren representing them at full length attended by theirsecretary the late mr court many of the persons being well rememberedby dashall were pointed out by him to his cousin and brought to hisrecollection names deservedly celebrated though now no more thispicture was the gift of the merchant brethren in tallyhoho was much delighted with his survey of this truly elegantbuilding and the luminous account given by his cousin ofthe various persons whose portraits met his eye or whose names andcharacters connected with the establishment had become celebrated forscientific research or indefatigable industryit will occupy too much time this morning said dashall to visitthe interior of the tower as i have dispatched a ticketporter topiccadilly ordering my curricle to be at tom's coffeehouse at one wewill therefore defer that pleasure to the next opportunity of being thisway we will however take a look at the bank and the exchange then atrundle into the fresh air for an hour and return home to dinner socome along but we will vary our walk by taking another road backwith this intention they now crossed tower hill and turned to theleft along the minoreshere is a place said dashall well known and no doubt you haveoften heard of sparrow corner and rosemary lane are better known bythe appellation of rag fair it is a general mart for the sale ofsecondhand clothes and many a welllooking man in london is indebtedto his occasional rambles in this quarter for his appearance thebusiness of this place is conducted with great regularity and thedealers and collectors of old clothes meet at a certain hour of theafternoon to make sales and exchanges so that it is managed almost uponthe same plan as the royal exchange only that the dealers here comeloaded with their goods which must undergo inspection before sales canbe effected while the merchant carries with him merely a sample ordirects his purchaser to the warehouse where his cargo is deposited theprincipal inhabitants of this place are jews and they obtain suppliesfrom the numerous itinerant collectors from all quarters of london andits suburbs whom you must have observed parading the streets from theearliest hour of the morning crying ould clothes clothes sale it surely can hardly be a trade worth following said tallthothere are many hundreds daily wandering the streets however repliedtom in pursuit of castoff apparel rags and metals of differentsorts or at least pretend so the jews are altogether a set of tradersi do not mean to confine my observations to them only because thereare persons of other sects employed in the same kind of business andperhaps a more dangerous set of cheats could scarcely be pointedat as their chief business really is to prowl about the houses andstables of people of rank and fortune in order to hold out temptationsto their servants to pilfer and steal small articles not likely to bemissed which these fellows are willing to purchase at about onethirdof their real value it is supposed that upwards of of thesedepraved itinerants among the jews are daily employed in journeys ofthis kind by which means through the medium of base money and otherfraudulent dealings many of them acquire property with which they openshops and then become receivers of stolen property the losses thussustained by the public being almost incalculablefor wit coot gould rings of copper gilt tis so he gets hisbreadwit his sealingvax of brickdust and his pencils without leadit is estimated that there are from fifteen to twenty thousand jews inthe metropolis and about five or six thousand more stationed in thegreat provincial and seaport towns in london they have six synagoguesand in the country places there are at least twenty more most of thelower classes of those distinguished by name of german or dutch jewslive principally by their wits and establish a system of mischievousintercourse all over the country the better to enable them to carryon thenfraudulent designs in every way the pliability of theirconsciences is truly wonderfulfor they never stick at trifles if there's monies in the waynay i remember the time when they used to perambulate our streetsopenly professing to purchase base coin by bawling any bad shillingany bad shilling the interference of the police however has preventedthe calling though perhaps it is impossible to prevent a continuanceof the practice any more than they can that of utterance these menhesitate not to purchase stolen property or metals of various kinds aswell as other articles pilfered from the dockyards and stolen inthe provincial towns which are brought to the metropolis to eludedetection and vice versa in some cases there are contrivances thatthe buyer and seller shall not even see each other in order that noadvantage may be taken by giving information as to the parties upon my life the contrivances of london are almost incomprehensiblesaid bob and might deter many from venturing into it but thissurprises me beyond any thingit is however too lamentably true continued tom for these peopleeducated in idleness from the earliest infancy acquire every debauchedand vicious principle which can fit them for the most complicated artsof fraud and deception to which they seldom fail to add the crime ofperjury whenever it can be useful to shield themselves or their friendsfrom the punishment of the law totally without moral education andvery seldom trained to any trade or occupation by which they can earn anhonest livelihood by manual labour their youths excluded from becomingapprentices and their females from engaging themselves generallyas servants on account of the superstitious adherence to the mereceremonial of their persuasion as it respects meat not killed byjews nothing can exceed their melancholy condition both as it regardsthemselves and society thus excluded from the resources which otherclasses of the community possess they seem to have no alternativebut to resort to those tricks and devices which ingenuity suggeststo enable persons without an honest means of subsistence to live inidlenessthe richer jews are in the practice of lending small sums to the poorerclasses of their community in order that they may support themselves bya species of petty traffic but even this system contributes in nosmall degree to the commission of crimes since in order to renderit productive to an extent equal to the wants of families who do notacquire any material aid by manual labour they are induced to resort tounlawful means of increasing it by which they become public nuisancesfrom the orangeboy and the retailer of seals razors glass and otherwares in the public streets or the collector ofold rags old jags old bonnets old bagsto the shopkeeper dealer in wearing apparel or in silver and goldthe same principles of conduct too generally prevailthe itinerants utter base money to enable them by selling cheap todispose of their goods while those who are stationary with very fewexceptions receive and purchase at an under price whatever is broughtthem without asking questions and yet most of their concernsare managed with so much art that we seldom hear of a jew being hangedand it is also a fact that during the holidays of which they have manyin the course of a year or at one of their weddings you may seethebarrowwoman of yesterday decked out in gay and gaudy attire of anexpensive natureby this time they had reached the top of the minores and were turningdown houndsditch we are now said dashall close to another placechiefly inhabited by jews called duke's place where they have a veryelegant synagogue which has been visited by royalty the present kinghaving during his regency honoured them with a visit through theintroduction of the late mr goldsmith if it should be a holiday wewill be present at the religious ceremonies of the morning with thisthey entered duke's place and were soon within the walls of this templeof judaism in taking a view of it bob was much gratified with itssplendid decorations and without being acquainted with their forms haddoffed his castor but was presently informed by his cousin that hemust keep his hat on the readers appeared to him to be singers but thewhole of the service being hebrew it was of little consequence to himwhether read or sung he perceived during the performances of theseprayers which were every now and then joined in by almost everyonepresent that many of the congregation appeared to be in closeconversation which however was taken no notice of by the personsofficiating he was well pleased with the singing of a youth and theaccompaniment of a gentleman in a cock'd hat for although he could notdiscover that he actually produced words he produced sounds in manyinstances bearing a strong similarity to those of a bassoon thevenerable appearance and devotion of the high priest who was habited inarobe of white also attracted his attention while the frequent burstsof the congregation joining in the exercises of the morning in someinstances almost provoked his risibilitythe religious ceremonies of these people said tom as they left thesynagogue though somewhat imposing as to form and appearance do notseem to be strongly interesting for many of them are engaged during thewhole of the service in some species of traffic buying and doffed his castor taken off his hat selling or estimating the value of goods for sale they are suchdetermined merchants and dealers that they cannot forget business evenin the house of prayer we have two sets of them this is the dutchsynagogue but the most ancient is that of the portuguese having beenestablished in england ever since the usurpation the members of itbeing mostly wealthy are extremely attentive to their poor among whomthere is said not to be a single beggar or itinerant while the dutch orgerman jews get no education at all even the most affluent of them aresaid to be generally unable either to read or write the language of thecountry that gave them birth they confine themselves to a bastard orvulgar hebrew which has little analogy to the original they observethe particular ritual of the german synagogue and also include thepolish russian and turkish jews established in london with theexception of a few wealthy individuals and as many families who are intrade on the royal exchange they are in general a very indigent classof people their community being too poor to afford them adequaterelief they have resorted to the expedient of lending them small sumsof money at interest to trade upon which is required to be repaidmonthly or weekly as the case may be otherwise they forfeit all claimto this aidthe portuguese jews are generally opulent and respectable and holdno community with the others they use a different liturgy and theirlanguage is even different they never intermarry with the jews of thedutch synagogue they pride themselves on their ancestry and give theirchildren the best education which can be obtained where they reside thebrokers upon the exchange of the jewish persuasion are all or chieflyof the portuguese synagogue their number is limited to twelve by act ofparliament and they pay guineas each for this privilegethey had now reached the end of houndsditch when passing throughbishopsgate church yard and broad street they were soon at the bankthis building said dashall covers an extent of several acres ofground and is completely isolatedits exterior replied bob is not unsuited to the nature ofthe establishment as it certainly conveys an idea of strength andsecurity that's true continued tom but you may observe a want ofuniformity of design and proportion arising from its having beenerected piecemeal at different periods and according to differentplans by several architects this is the principal entrance andopposite to it is the shortest street in the metropolis called bankstreet it contains but one house now we will take a survey of theinteriorthey entered the hall where tallyhoho was much pleased to be instructedas to the methodical way they have of examining notes for a reissuingor exchanging into coinhere said dashall are the drawingoffices for public and privateaccounts this room is seventynine feet long by forty and at thefurther end you observe a very fine piece of sculpture that is amarble statue of king william iii the founder of the bank thi nationalestablishment was first incorporated by act of parliament in theprojector of the scheme was a mr james paterson a native ofscotland and the direction of its concerns is vested in a governordeputygovernor and twentyfour directors elected annually at ageneral court of the proprietors thirteen of the directors with thegovernor form a court for the transaction of business the bank is openevery day from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon holidaysexcepted it is like a little town the clerks at present are about in number but a reduction is intended the rotunda is the mostinteresting apartment we will go and have a look at the moneydealershere continued he as they entered the rotunda and mingled amongthe various persons and sounds that are so well known in that seatof traffic from the hours of eleven to three a crowd of eagermoneydealers assemble and avidity of gain displays itself inevervarying shapes at times truly ludicrous to the disinterestedobserver you will presently perceive that the rustling and crowdingof the jobbers to catch a bargain frequently exceed in disorder thescrambling at the doors of our theatres for an early admission and saloud and clamorous at times are the mingled noises of the buyers andsellers that all distinction of sound is lost in a general uproarof this description tallyhoho had an absolute proof in a fewminutes for the mingling variety of voices appeared to leave nospace in time for distinguishing either the sense or the sound of theindividual speakers though it was evident that notwithstanding thecontinual hubbub there was a perfect understanding effectedbetween parties for the sale and transfer of stock according to thestipulations bargained forha mr m said the hon tom dashall how do you dohappy to say well sir thank you was the reply anycommands markets are pretty brisk this morning and we are all alivepray said tallyhoho who is that extraordinary looking lady with suchred lips and cheeks beneath the garb of sadnessa constant visitor here replied mr m i may say a day scarcelypasses without her being presentshe has a curious appearance said bob her dress is all blackfrom head to foot and yet her cheeks disclose the ruddy glow ofuninterrupted health is it that her looks belie her garb or that hergarb belies her lookshush said mr m let her pass and i will give you some informationrelative to her which if it does not gratify you will at leastsatisfy some of your inquiries i am half inclined to believe that allisnot right in the seat of government with her pointing his finger tohis head and she is therefore rather deserving of pity than an objectof censure or ridicule though i have reason to believe she frequentlymeets with attacks of the latter when in search of the sympathy andbenefit to be derived from a proper exercise of the former her name ismiss w her father was formerly a twopenny postman who residedat rockingham row walworth and was himself somewhat eccentric in hisdress and manners and it was not at all unusual to meet him inthe morning in the garb of his office though decidedly against hisinclination and to see him on change during change hours in silkstockings and in every other way dressed as a merchant attendingthere according to custom and practice and he managed by some meansor other to keep up a character of respectability and to give anaccomplished education to the younger branches of this family so thatthis lady though unfortunate in her present circumstances has beenwell brought up and mingled in polished society and ifyou were to enter into conversation with her now you would findher intelligent in the selection of her words and the combination ofsentences to explain to you the most improbable events and the mostunheard of claims that she has upon all the governments in the knownworld this however would be done with good temper unless any thinglike an insulting observation should be conceived or intended to beconveyedand pray what is supposed to be the cause of her present manners andappearance inquired bobit is principally attributed replied mr m to the circumstance oflosing a beloved brother who she now continually declares is only keptfrom her by the persons who daily visit the rotunda with a viewto prevent the recovery of the property she lays claim to and theparticulars of which she generally carries in her pocket that brotherhowever suffered the penalty of the law for a forgery but this shecannot be induced to believe the lamentable effusion of blood which has taken placewithin the last twenty years in consequence of forgeries onthe bank of england has already excited a very considerableportion of public interest and indignation and it is muchto be feared that notwithstanding the very serious expencethe corporation have incurred with a view to remedy theevil by rendering the imitation more difficult theanticipated result is not likely to be obtained it willhardly be conceived that the governors have expended as muchas one hundred thousand pounds in this laudable undertakingand upon producing an impression we are told it can beimitated by one who within three weeks produced a facsimileand puzzled the makers of the original note todiscover which was the workmanship of their own hands nayeven an engraver on wood is said to have produced anexcellent imitation in a few hours it is however sincerelyto be hoped that an effectual stop will be eventually put tothe possibility of committing this crime which weapprehend nine times out of ten brings the poor needyhalfstarved retailer of paper to the gallows while themore unprincipled wholesale dealer escapes detectionwhile on the subject of forged notes we cannot helpdeprecating the circulation of what are termed flashnotes which if not originally intended to deceive anddefraud are calculated to accomplish these objects when inthe hands of the artful and designing we think there is atradesman in the vicinity of the bank who presents such ofhis customers as visits his repository to have their haircut c with a hash note purporting to be for and wehave also reason to believe that more than one attempt hasbeen detected where the parties have really endeavoured topass them as valid bank of england paper the dangertherefore must be evident we have reason to think she is frequently much straitened forwant of the necessary supplies for sustenance and she has temporaryrelief occasionally from those who knew her family and her formercircumstances in life while she boldly perseveres in the pursuit offancied property and the restoration of her brotheri have heard her make heavy complaints of the difficulties she has hadto encounter and the privations she has been subjected to but her ownlanguage will best speak the impressions on her mind here is a printedletter which was circulated by her some time agoto the worthy inhabitants of the parish of st mary lexington surreyit is with feelings of deep regret i have to deplore the necessity thatcompels me to adopt a public measure for the purpose of obtaining myproperty from those gentlemen that hold it in trust for a period of tenyears i have endured the most cruel and unjustifiable persecution whichhas occasioned the premature death of my mother a considerable loss ofproperty all my personal effects of apparel and valuables has exposedme to the most wanton and barbarous attacks the greatest insults andthe severe and continual deprivation of every common necessary havingmade every appeal for my right or even a maintenance without effecti now take the liberty of adopting the advice of some opulent friends inthe parish and solicit general favour in a loan by subscription for agiven time not doubting the liberal commiseration of many ladiesand gentlemen towards so great a sufferer as it is not possible todescribe the wrongs i have endured the misery that has been heaped uponme in so limited a space i shall be happy to give every explanationupon

mr m on one side tom and bob wished him a good morningthey proceeded to view the various offices which branch outfrom the rotunda and which are appropriated to the management of eachparticular stock in each of which bob could not help admiring the happydisposition of every department to facilitate business the arrangementof the books and the clerks under the several letters of the alphabethe conceived was truly excellentthe corporation of the bank said dashall are prohibited fromtrading in any sort of goods or merchandize whatsoever but are toconfine the use of their capital to discounting bills of exchange andto the buying and selling of gold and silver bullion with a permissionhowever to sell such goods as are mortgaged or pawned to them and notredeemed within three months after the expiration of the time for theirredemption their profits arise from their traffic in bullion thediscounting of bills of exchange for bankers merchants factors andspeculators and the remuneration they receive from government formanaging the public funds and for receiving the subscriptions on loansand lotteries but we may ramble about in these places for a month andstill have novelty in store and there is a little world underneath thegreater part of this extensive building devoted to printingofficeswarerooms cthey had now reached the door which leads into bartholomew lane andupon descending the steps and turning to the left bob's eyes soondiscovered the auction mart what have we here inquired hethat replied his cousin is a building which may deservedly berank'd as one of the ornaments of the city and its arrangements andeconomy as well as the beauty of its interior are well deserving thenotice of every stranger this fine establishment which serves as afocus for the sale of estates and other property by public auction isboth useful and ornamental it was built about the time when the spiritof combination was so strong in london you must know some years backevery kind of business and trade appeared likely to be carried on byjoint stock companies and the profits divided upon small shares manyfireoffices have to date their origin from this source the hope theeagle the atlas and others the golden lane brewery was openedupon this principle some water companies were established tillneighbourhood and partnership almost became synonymous and ibelieve among many other institutions of that kind the building beforeus is one it contains many handsome rooms and commodious offices butas for offices every street and every alley abounds with them andnowadays if you want to hire a cook or a scullion you have nothingto do but to send a letter to a registeroffice and you are suited inatwinkling it was an excellent idea and i remember the old buck whoused to call himself the founder of establishments of that nature orrather the first introducer of them to the notice of englishmen poorold courtoisjohn courtois is said to have been a native of picardy where he wasborn about the year or he repaired to this country while yetyoung in the character of valet de chambre to a gentleman who hadpicked him up in his travels and as he came from one of the poorestof the french provinces he took root and throve wonderfully on histransplantation to a richer soilon the death of his master he removed to the neighbourhood of thestrand and st martin's street leicester square became the scene ofhis industry and success at a time when wigs were worn by boys and afrenchman was supposed the only person capable of making one fit forthe grande monarque he commenced business as a perruquier andsoon acquired both wealth and celebrity to this he joined anotheremployment which proved equally lucrative and appropriate as itsubjected both masters and servants to his influence this was thekeeping of a registeroffice one of the first known in the metropoliswhence he drew incalculable advantages he is also said to have been adealer in hair which he imported largely from the continent and yetafter all it is difficult to conceive how he could have realized afortune exceeding l but what may not be achieved by a man whodespised no gains however small and in his own expressive languageconsidered farthings as the seeds of guineasthe following appears to be a true description of this veryextraordinary man whom we ourselves have seen more than once oldcourtois was well known for more than half a century in the purlieus ofst martin's and the haymarket his appearance was meagre and squalidand his clothes such as they were were pertinaciously got up inexactly the same cut and fashion and the colour always either fawn ormarine for the last thirty years the venerable chapeau was uniformlyof the same cock the principal feat however in which this ferventvotary of plutus appeared before the public was his nearly fatal affairwith mary benson otherwise mrs maria theresa phepoe in april this illfatedwoman projected a rather bungling scheme in orderto frighten her old acquaintance and visitor courtois out of aconsiderable sum of money one evening when she was certain of hiscalling she had her apartment prepared for his reception in a speciesof funereal style a bier a black velvet pall black wax candleslighted c no sooner had the friend entered the room than the ladyassisted by her maid pounced on him forced him into an arm chairin which he was forcibly held down by the woman while the hostessbrandishing a caseknife or razor swore with some violent imprecationsthat instant should be his last if he did not give her an order on hisbanker for a large sum of money the venerable visitor alarmed at thegloomy preparations and dire threats of the desperate female asked forpen ink and paper which being immediately produced he wrote a checkon his banker for two thousand pounds he immediately retired withprecipitation happy to escape without personal injury the nextmorning before its opening he attended at the banker's with somepoliceofficers and on mrs phepoe's making her appearance with thecheck she was arrested and subsequently tried at the old bailey on acapital charge grounded on the above proceedings however throughthe able defence made by her counsel the late mr fielding who took alegal objection to the case as proved and contended that she neverhad or obtained any property of mr courtois on the principle thatpossession constituted the first badge of ownership she was onlysentenced to twelve months imprisonmentsome years since the late lord gage met courtois at the courtroom ofthe east india house on an election business ah courtois said hislordship what brings you here to give my votes my lord was theanswer what are you a proprietor most certainly and of morevotes than one yes my lord i have four aye indeed whythen before you take the book pray be kind enough to pin up my curlswith which modest request the proprietor of four votes equal to tenthousand pounds immediately compliedm courtois married a few years since and has left several childrenon reflecting that his widow's thirds would amount to an immense sumwith his usual prudence he made a handsome settlement on her duringhis lifetime as his sons were not of very economical habits he hasbequeathed them small annuities only and vested the bulk of his fortunein trustees on behalf of his daughters who are infantsuntil his death he invariably adhered to the costume of the age inwhich he was born a threecocked hat and a plumcoloured coatboth rather the worse for wear in which we have seen him frequentlyinvariably designated his person and habits while a penurious economythat bid defiance to all vulgar imitation accompanied him to his gravehis death occurred in in the seth or syst year of his agesuch characters observed tallyhoho notwithstanding theireccentricity afford useful lessons to those who in this giddy anddissipated age devote a part of their time to thinkingno doubt of it replied dashall they furnish examples of what maybedone by perseverance and determination and almost seem to verify theassertion that every one may become rich if he pleases but come wemust move towards tom's coffee house in our way to which we willpass through the royal exchange which lies directly before us it wasoriginally a brick building erected by sir thomas gresham in the year but being destroyed by the fire of london in the presentbuilding of portland stone was raised in its place the first stoneof which was laid by charles ii in in consequence of which hisstatue has been placed in the centre of its quadrangle around which themerchants assemble daily to transact their commercial businesses the merry monarch was fond of the citizens and frequentlyhonoured the lord mayor's table with his presence it issaid of him that on retiring to his carriage one day afterdining with the civic sovereign he was followed by thelatter who with a freedom inspired by the roseate deitylaid hold of his majesty by the arm and insisted that heshould not go until he had drunk t'other bottle the monarchturned round and goodhumouredly repeating a line from anold song the man that is drunk is as great as a kingwent back to the company and doubtless complied with thelord mayor's request it has two principal fronts one in cornhill and the otherwhich you now see is at the end of threadneedle street each of whichhas a piazza affording a convenient shelter from the sun and rainit is open as a thoroughfare from eight in the morning till six in theevening but the hours in which business is chiefly transacted are fromtwo to five its extent is feet by by this time they had passed the gate and bob found himself in ahandsome area with a fine piazza carried entirely round and furnishedwith seats along the four walks for merchants of different nations whomeet each at their different stations and was immediately attractedby the appearance of the numerous specimens of art with which it wasadorneddo you observe said his cousin within these piazzas aretwentyeight niches all vacant but that in which is placed a statue ofsir thomas gresham in the northwest angle and that in the southwestwhich presents a statue of sir john barnard magistrate of the city andone of its representatives in parliament those smaller statues in theniches of the wall of the quadrangle in the upper story are the kingsand queens of england beginning with edward i on the north side andending with his late majesty on the east as far as charles i they wereexecuted by gabriel cibber the various frames which are placed aroundunder the piazza contain the names residences and occupations oftradesmen mechanics and others the grand front in cornhill hasbeen under repair lately and in its appearance no doubt is greatlyimproved the steeple which is just raised is a handsome domesurmounted by the original grasshopper rendered somewhat celebrated bya prophecy that certain alterations would take place in men mannersand times when the grasshopper on the top of the exchange should meetthe dragon at the top of bow church and strange and extraordinary as itmay appear this very circumstance is said to have taken place asthey have both been seen in the warehouse of some manufacturer towhom they were consigned for repair in addition to which ifcrockery's relation of the transmogrifications of england is tobe believed the prophecy is in a considerable degree a whimsical andlaughable burnett in one act has recently been produced at the royalcoburg theatre in which mr sloan sings with admirable comicalitythe following song alluded to by the hon tom

similar occupationdashall and bob of the many hundreds of individuals present wereperhaps the only two led to the place by curiosity alonetallyhoho who on every occasion of doubtful dilemma looked to

juvenile voluptuaries females many of them underfourteen years of age offering themselves to indiscriminateprostitution in a state verging on absolute nudity alluring thepassengers by every seductive wile to the haunts of depravity fromwhich retreat was seldom effected without pecuniary exaction andfrequently accompanied by personal violence the nuisance has beenpartly abated but entirely to remove it would be a task of moredifficult accomplishment than that of cleansing the augean stable andwould baffle all the labours of herculesthis fact observed tallyhoho throws an indelible stain onmetropolitan policenot so answered his companion scarce a day passes without groups ofthese unfortunates being held before a magistrate and humanely disposedof in various ways with the view of preventing a recurrence to vicioushabits but in vain the stain is more attributed to the depravednature of man who first seduces and then casts off to infamyand indigence the unhappy victim of credulity many of these wretchedgirls would in all probability gladly have abstained from the careerof vice if on their first fall they had experienced the consolingprotection of parents or friends but shut out from home exiled fromhumanity divested of character and without resources no choice isleft other than mendicity or prostitutionthe sombre reflections occasioned by these remarks gradually

redundancy the poet had noother alternative than that of inviting the respectable visitants tohis attic or as the landlord facetiously named the lofty domicile hisfirst floor down the chimneyreal life in london must be seen to be believed the hon tom dashalland his friend tallyhoho were reared in the lap of luxury and neveruntil now formed an adequate conception of the distressing privationsattendant on suffering humanitywith a dejection of spirits evidently occasioned by the humiliatingnecessity of ushering his polished friends into the wretched asylum ofpenury the poet led the way with tardy reluctancy while his visitorsregretted every step of ascent under the appalling circumstance ofgiving pain to adversity yet they felt that to recede would be moreindelicate than to advancethe apartment which they now entered seemed a lumber room for thereception of superfluous or unserviceable furniture containing notfewer than eleven decayed and mutilated chairs of varied

to his no small surprise the confusion of the poetand amusement of dashallwith many apologies for the awkwardness of their very humbleaccommodation and grateful expression of thanks for the honourconferred upon him the poet replaced tallyhoho in a firmer seat and asilence of some few moments ensued the two friends being at a loss inwhat manner to explain and the poet unwilling to inquire the object oftheir visitdashall began at last by observing that in pursuit of the knowledge ofreal life in london he and his accompanying friend had met with manyincidents both ludicrous and interesting but that in the presentinstance their visit was rather influenced by sympathy than curiosity and that where they could be serviceable to the interest ofmerit in obscurity they always should be happy in the exercise of aduty so perfectly congenial with their feelingsmany years had elapsed since the person to whom these remarks wereaddressed had heard the voice of consolation and its effect wasinstantaneous his usual sombre cast of countenance became brightened bythe glow of cheerful animation and he even dwelt on the subject of hisunfortunate circumstances with jocularitythe elevated proximity of a garret he observed to the sublimerregions has often been resorted to as the roost of genius and whyshould i of the most slender if any literary pretensions complainand yet my writings scattered amongst the various fugitive periodicalpublications of this and our sister island if collected together wouldform a very voluminous compilationi have always understood said bob that the quality not thequantum constituted the fame of an author's productionstrue sir answered the poet and i meant not the vanity ofarrogating to myself any merit from my writings with reference

acquiescedhave you never asked dashall thought of publishing a volume bysubscriptioni meditated such intention answered the poet not long ago drewup the necessary prospectus with a specimen of the

satisfactionseveral of our nobility honoured me with their names and others mypatrons were of the very first class of literature neverthelessi encountered much contumelious reception and after an irksomeand unavailing perseverance of a month's continuance i was at lastcompelled to relinquish all hope of successhaving then on my list the name of a very worthy alderman who latelyfilled the civic

whose dismal features and longvisages plainly indicated some unpleasant disaster and tom began tofear blame would be attached to them for leaving his party at warehouselanepray said merrywell can you tell me where to find your friendsparkleindeed replied dashall a little relieved by this question i am notsparkle's keeper but pray be seated what is the matter is it a dueldo you want a second i know he is a good shotthis levity sir said mortimer is not to be borne the honour of arespectable family is at stake and must be satisfied no doubt youas his very oldest friend know where he is and i desire you willimmediately inform me or sir said dashall who was as averse as unused to be desired by anyperson do you know whom you address and that i am in my own houseif you do you have certainly discarded all propriety of conduct andlanguage before you cross'd the thresholdgentlemen said merrywell perhaps some explanation is reallynecessary here my friend mortimer speaks under agonized feelingsfor which i am sure your good sense will make every allowance missmortimer miss mortimer exclaimed dashall rising from his seat youinterest me strongly say what of miss mortimeralas said mortimer evidently endeavouring to suppress emotions whichappeared to agitate his whole frame and absorb every mental facultywe are unable to account for her absence and strongly suspect she isin company with your friend sparkle can you give us any informationrelative to either of themdashall assured them he knew nothing of the fugitives but that hewould certainly make every inquiry in his power if possible to findout sparkle upon which they departed though not without hinting theyexpected tom had the power of making a search more effectually thaneither mortimer or merrywellegad said tom to tallyhoho this absence of sparkle means somethingmore than i can at present conceive and it appears that we mustnow venture forth in search of our guide i hope he has taken a gooddirection himselfmortimer appears hurt continued bob and i can scarcely wonder atitit is a trifle in high life nowadays replied dashall and my lifefor it we shall obtain some clue to his mode of operation before theday is out love is a species of madness and oftentimes inducesextraordinary movements i have discovered its existence in his breastfor some time past and if he is really with the lady i wonder myselfthat he has not given some sort of intimation though i know he is verycautious in laying his plans and very tenacious of admitting too manypersons to know his intentions for fear of some indiscreet friendunintentionally frustrating his designsi apprehend we shall have a wildgoose chase of it rejoined bobit serves however continued tom to diversify our peregrinationsand if it is his pleasure to be in love we will endeavour to chasepleasure in pursuit of the lover and if guided by honourable motiveswhich i cannot doubt we will wish him all the success he can wishhimself only regretting that we are deprived of his agreeable companystill free as air the active mind will roveand search out proper objects for its lovebut that once fix'd tis past the pow'r of artto chase the dear idea from the hearttis liberty of choice that sweetens lifemakes the glad husband and the happy wife but come let us forth and see how the land lies many personsobtain all their notoriety from an elopement it makes a noise in theworld and even though frequently announced in our newspapers underfictitious titles the parties soon become known and are recollectedever after and some even acquire fame by the insertion of a paragraphannouncing an elopement in which they insinuate that themselves areparties so that an elopement in high life may be considered as one ofthe sure roads to popularitybut not always a safe one replied boblife is full of casualties rejoined dashall and you are bythis time fully aware that it requires something almost beyond humanforesight to continue in the line of safety while you are in pursuit ofreal life in london though it may fairly be said that all the world'sa stage and all the men and women merely passengers still they havetheir inside and their outside places and each man in his time meetswith strange adventures it may also very properly be termed a cameraobscura reflecting not merely trees signposts houses c butthe human heart in all

his neighbour cunning shutting his eyeswhile listening to a pedagogue and credulity opening his eyes and earswilling and anxious to be deceived and dupedit is a strange world indeed said tallyhoho and

curtainall's over good nightby this time they were at long's where upon inquiry all trace ofsparkle had been lost for two days all was mystery and surprise not somuch that he should be absent as that his servant could give no accountof him which was rather extraordinary tom ascertained however thatno suspicion appeared to have been excited as to miss mortimer andwith commendable discretion avoided expressing a word which couldcreate such an idea merely observing that most likely he had taken anunexpected trip into the country and would be heard of before the daywas outon leaving long's however they were met again by mortimer in breathlessanxiety evidently labouring under some new calamityi am glad i have found you said he addressing himself to dashallfor i am left in this d d wilderness of a place without a friendto speak tohow inquired ton what the d l is the matter with youwhy you must know that merry well is gone gone where toto to zounds i've forgot the name of the people but two

concise but comprehensive picture of your own situationbut don't despair man you will yet find all right be assured putyourself under my guidance let the world wag as it will it is uselessto torment yourself with things you cannot prevent or curethe right end of life is to live and be jolly mortimer scarcely knew how to relish this advice and seemed todoubt within himself whether it was meant satirically or feelingly tilldashall whispered in his ear a caution not to betray the circumstancesthat had transpired for his sister's sake but continued he inever suffer these things which are by no

russel courton coming up with the crowd they found the cause of the vast assemblageof persons to be no other than a quakers decorated with a tricolouredcockade who was a circumstance of a truly alarming and distressing natureto which dashall alluded in this place was recently madeknown to the public in the daily journals and which shouldserve as a lesson to similar adventurersit appeared that a young man had been induced to enter ahouse of ill fame in charles street covent garden by oneof its cyprian inmates to whom he gave some money in orderfor her to provide them with supper that upon her returnhe desired to have the difference between what he had givenand what she had expended returned to him which beingperemptorily refused he determined to leave the house ondescending the staircase for which purpose he was met bysome men with whom he had a violent struggle to escapethey beat and bruised him most unmercifully and afterwardsthrew him from a twopair of stairs window into the streetwhere he was found by the watchman with his skull fracturedand in a state of insensibility we believe all attemptshave hitherto proved fruitless to bring the actualperpetrator or perpetrators of this diabolical deed topunishment bowstreet thursday morning an eccentric personage whohas for some time been seen about the streets of themetropolis in the habit of a quaker and wearing the tricolouredcockade in his broad white hat made his appearanceat the door of this office and presenting a large packet toone of the officers desired him in a tone of authority tolay it instantly before the magistrate the magistrate gr minshull esq having perused this singular paperinquired for the person who brought it and in the nextmoment a young man in the garb of a quaker with a broadbrimmedpeacefullooking drabcoloured beaver on hishead surmounted by a furious tricoloured cockade wasbrought before him this strange anomalous personagehaving placed himself very carefully directly in front ofthe bench smiled complacently upon his worship and thefollowing laconic colloquy ensued forthwithmagistrate did you bring this letterquaker thou hast said itmagistratewhat is your object in bringing itquaker merely to let thee know what is going on in theworld and moreover being informed that if i came to thyoffice i should be taken into custody i was desirous toascertain whether that information was truemagistrate then i certainly shall not gratify you byordering you into custodyquaker thou wilt do as seemeth right in thy eyes i assurethee i have no inclination to occupy thy time longer than isprofitable to us and therefore i will retire whenever thoushalt signify that my stay is unpleasant to theemagistrate why do you wear your hat are you a quakerquaker thou mayest it but that is not my sole motive forwearing it to be plain with thee i wear it because i choseto do so canst thee tell me of any law which compels meto take it offmagistrate i'll tell you what friend i would seriouslyrecommend you to retire from this place as speedily aspossiblequaker i take thy advice farewellthus ended this comical conversation and the eccentricfriend immediately departed in peacethe brother of the above person attended at the office onsaturday and stated that the quaker is insane that he wasproprietor of an extensive farm near relate in surrey forsome years but that in may last his bodily health beingimpaired he was confined for some time and on his recoveryit was found that his intellects were affected and he wasput under restraint but recovered some time since heabsconded from relate and his friends were unable todiscover him until they saw the account of his eccentricitiesin the newspapers mr squire was desirous if hemade his appearance again at the office he should bedetained the magistrate as a cause for the detention ofthe quaker swore the brother to these facts about threeo'clock the quaker walked up bowstreet when an officerconducted him to the presence of the magistrate whodetained him and at seven o'clock delivered him into thecare of his brother very quietly walking with a police officer and exhibiting acaricature of himself mounted on a velocipede and riding overcorruption c it was soon ascertained that he had accepted aninvitation from one of the magistrates of bow street to pay him a visitas he had done the day before and was at that moment going before himi apprehend he is a little cracked said tom but however that maybehe is a very harmless sort of person but come we have other gamein view and our way lies in a different

unusual degree of lustreupon the articles put up for sale it is not however very difficult todistinguish them from the real ones notwithstanding they assume all theexterior appearances of genuineness even up to advertisements in thenewspapers purporting to be held in the house of a person lately goneaway under embarrassed circumstances or deceased they are denominatedmock auctions because no real intention exists on the part of thesellers to dispose of their articles under a certain price previouslyfixed upon which although it may not be high is invariably more thanthey are actually worth besides which they may be easily discovered bythe anxiety they evince to show the goods to strangers atthe moment they enter never failing to bestow overstrainedpanegyrics upon every lot they put up and asking repeatedly whatshall we say for this article a better cannot be produced andpromising if not approved of when purchased to change it theauctioneer has a language suited to all companies and according to hisview of a customer can occasionally jest bully or perplex him intoa purchase the goods must be sold at what they will fetch andhe declares notwithstanding among his confederates who stand by asbidders they are run up beyond the real value in order to catch aflat that the present bidding can never have paid the manufacturerfor his labourin such places various articles of silver plate glass and householdfurniture are exposed to sale but generally made up of damagedmaterials and slight workmanship of little intrinsic value for theselfsame purpose as the razorseller

money upon all sorts of articles ofhousehold furniture linen plate wearing appareljewellery c with a certainty of making a very handsomeprofit upon the money so circulatedthere are in this metropolis upwards of two hundred andthirty pawnbrokers and in some cases they are a useful andserviceable class of people and although doubtless many ofthem are honest and reputable persons there are still amongthem a class of sharpers and swindlers who obtain licencesto carry on the business and bring disgrace upon therespectable part of the profession every species of fraudwhich can add to the distresses of those who are compelledto raise temporary supplies of money is resorted to and forwhich purpose there are abundance of opportunities in manyinstances however the utility of these persons inpreventing a serious sacrifice of property cannot bedenied for by advancing to tradesmen and mechanicstemporary loans upon articles of value at a period ofnecessity an opportunity of redeeming them is affordedwhen by their industrious exertions their circumstances areimproved many of them however are receivers of stolengoods and under cover of their licence do much harm tothe public indeed the very easy mode of raising money bymeans of the pawnbrokers operates as an inducement or atleast an encouragement to every species of vice thefraudulent tradesman by their means is enabled to raisemoney on the goods of his creditors the servant to pledgethe property of his employer and the idle or profligatemechanic to deposit his working tools or his work in anunfinished state many persons in london are in the habit ofpawning their apparel from monday morning till saturdaynight when they are redeemed in order to make a decentappearance on the next day in low neighbourhoods and amongloose girls much business is done by pawnbrokers to goodadvantage and considerable emolument is derived from womenof the town the articles they offer to pledge are generallyof the most costly nature and the pilfering of the nightare usually placed in the hands of an uncle the nextmorning and the wary moneylenders fully acquainted withtheir necessities just lend what they please by whichmeans they derive a wonderful profit from the almostcertainty of these articles never being redeemedthe secresy with which a pawnbroker's business is conductedthough very proper for the protection of the honest andwellmeaning part of the population to shield them from anexposure which might perhaps prove fatal to their business orcredit admits of great room for fraud on the part of themoneylender more particularly as it respects the interestallowed upon the pawns many persons are willing to pay anycharge made rather than expose their necessities byappearing before a magistrate and acknowledging they havebeen concerned in such transactionspersons who are in the constant habit of pawning aregenerally known by the pawnbrokers in most instancesgoverned by their will and compelled to take and pay justwhat they please again much injury arises from the want ofcare in the pawnbroker to require a proper account from thepledgers of the manner in which the goods offered have beenobtained as duplicates are commonly given upon fictitiousnames and residencesnotwithstanding the care and attention usually paid to theexamination of the articles received as pledges thesegentlemen are sometimes to be duped by their customers weremember an instance of an elderly man who was in the habitof bringing a dutch clock frequently to a pawnbroker toraise the wind and for safety generally left it in a largecanvass bag till he became so regular a customer that hisclock and bag were often left without inspection and as itwas seldom deposited for long together it was placed insome handy nook of the shop in order to lie ready forredemption this system having been carried on for sometimeno suspicion was entertained of the old man upon oneoccasion however the pawnbroker's olfactory nerves weresaluted with a smell of a most unsavoury nature for whichhe could by no means account day after day passed and nodiscovery was made till at length he determined to overhaulevery article in his shop and if possible discover thesource of a nuisance which appeared rather to increase thanabate in doing which to his utter astonishment he foundthe old man's dutch clock transformed into a sheep's headenclosed in a small box similar in shape and size to that ofthe clock it will scarcely be necessary to add that beingin the heat of summer the sheep's head when turned out wasin a putrid state and as green as grass the pawnbrokerdeclared the old gentleman's works were out of repair thathe himself was out of tune and eventually pledged himselfnever to be so

way they wishedupon being assured of this and requested to take a seat after someintroductory conversation he gave them the following account of himselfand his businesswe have brought nine gemmen into the house this morning and though isay it no german goes out that would have any objection to come into itagaintallyhoho shrugged up his shoulders in a way that seemed to imply a doubt for continued

convey'd away without exposure that is if he understandsthingswith assurances of this kind the veracity of which no one present coulddoubt they were entertained for some time by their loquacious hostwho having the gift of the gab would probably have continued longin the same strain of important information when dinner was placed onthe table and they fell to with good appetites seeming almost to havemade use of the customary grace among theatricalsthe table cleared the frequent glass goes round and joke and song andmerriment aboundyour house said dashall might well be termed the temple of thearts since their real votaries are so frequently its inhabitantsvery true sir said safebind and as the poet observes it is asoften graced by the presence of the devotees to the sciences in pointof company he says we may almost call it multum in pavo or the cameraobscura of life there are at this time within these walls a learnedalchymist two students in anatomy and a physician a poet a playerand a musician the player is an adept at mimicry the musician a goodplayer and the poet no bad stick at a rhyme all anxious to turn theirtalents to good account and when mingled together productiveof harmony though the situation they are in at present is ratherdiscordant to their feelings but then you know tis said that discordis the soul of harmony and they knocked up a duet among themselvesyesterday which i thought highly amusingi am fond of music said merry well do you think they would take aglass of wine with us gift of the gab fluency of speech it is a very common thing among the minor theatricalswhen detained at rehearsals c to adjourn to someconvenient room in the neighbourhood for refreshment andequally common for them to commence operations in a trulydramatic way by exclaiming to each other in the languageof shakespearecome on macbeth come on macduffand d d be he who first cries hold enough most readily no doubt was the reply i will introduce themin a minute thus saying he left the room and in a very few minutesreturned with the three votaries of apollo who soon joined in theconversation upon general subjects the player now discovered hisloquacity the poet his sagacity and the musician his pertinacityfor he thought no tones so good as those produced by himself nor nonotes we beg pardon none but bank notes equal to his ownit will be sufficient for our present purpose to add that thebottle circulated quickly and what with the songs of the poet therecitations of the player and the notes of the fiddler time whichperfects all intellectual ability and also destroys the most stupendousmonuments of art brought the sons of apollo under the table andadmonished dashall and his cousin to depart which they accordinglydid after a promise to see their

tom was anxious to introduce to his cousin'snotice was that of a political dinner but while they were preparing fordeparture a letter arrived which completely satisfied the mind of thehon tom dashall as to the motives and views of their friend sparkleand ran as followsdear dashallhaving rivetted the chains of matrimony on the religious anvil ofgretna green i am now one of the happiest fellows in existencemy election is crowned with success and i venture to presume allafterpetitions will be rejected as frivolous and vexatious the oncelovely miss mortimer is now the ever to be loved mrs sparkle

sparklecarlisle the receipt of this letter and its contents were immediatelycommunicated to young mortimer who had already received someintelligence of a similar nature which had the effect of allayingapprehension and dismissing fear for his sister's safety the mysteriouscircumstances were at once explained and harmony was restored to thepreviously agitated familyi am truly glad of this information said tom and as we are atpresent likely to be politically engaged we cannot do less than take abumper or two after dinner to the health and happiness of the candidatewho so emphatically observes he has gained his election and in thetrue language of every patriot declares he is the happiest man alivenotwithstanding the rivets by which he is boundyou are inclined to be severe said tallyhohoby no means replied dashall the language of the letter certainlyseems a little in consonance with my observation but i am sincere in mygood wishes towards the writer and his amiable wife come we must nowtake a view of other scenes hear long speeches drink repeated bumpersand shout with lungs of leather till the air resounds with peals ofapprobationwe shall there see and hear the great men

comment by this time they had arrived at the crown and anchor tavern inthe strand where they found a great number of persons assembled sirf b having been announced as president in a few minutes he wasushered into the room with all due pomp and ceremony preceded bythe stewards for the occasion and accompanied by a numerous body offriends consisting of mr h major c and others thoughnot equally prominent equally zealous during dinner time all went onsmoothly except in some instances where the voracity of some ofthe visitors almost occasioned a chopping off the fingers of theirneighbours but the cloth once removed and non nobis domine sung byprofessional gentlemen had the effect of calling the attention of thecompany to harmony the band in the orchestra played o give me deathor liberty erin go brach britons strike home and whilst happyin my native land the singers introduced scots wha hae wi wallacebled peruvians wake to glory and the tyrolese hymn but thespirit of oratory enlivened by the fire of the bottle exhibited itsilluminating sparks in a blaze of lustre which eclipsed even the gaslightsby which they were surrounded so much so that the waitersthemselves became confused and remained stationary or when theymoved were so dazzled by the patriotic effusions of the variousspeakers that they fell over each other spilt the wine in the pocketsof the company and by making afterwards a hasty retreat left them tofight or argue between each other for supposed liberties taken even bytheir immediate friendsillustration pages political dinnerunbridled feelings of patriotic ardour appeared to pervade every onepresent and what with the splendid oratory of the speakers and thedeafening vociferations of the hearers at the conclusion of whatwas generally considered a good point a sufficient indication of thefeelings by which they were all animated was evincedat the lower end of the table sat a facetious clerical gentleman whounmindful of his ministerial duties was loud in his condemnation ofministers and as loud in his approbation of those who gave them whathe repeatedly called a good hit but here a subject of great laughteroccurred for mr marrowfat the peamerchant

momentous importancein their consideration and desirous to signalize themselvesindividually so completely defeated their objects by over anxiety togain precedence that they rolled over each other on the floor to theinexpressible amusement of the company and the total obliteration oftheir intended observations so much so that the harangue meant toenlighten their friends ended in a fine colloquy of abuse upon eachotherthe bottles the glasses and the other paraphernalia of the tablesuffered considerable diminution in the descent of these modern ciceroand a variety of speakers arising upon their downfall created so muchconfusion that our heroes fearing it would be some time before harmonycould be restored took up their hats and walkednow said dashall as they left the house you have had a fullview of the pleasantries of a political dinner and having seen thecharacters by which such an entertainment is generally attended anyfurther account of them is almost rendered uselessat least replied tallyhoho i have been gratified by the view of someof the leading men who contribute to fill up the columns of your londonnewspapersegad said his cousin now i think of it there is a tine

joythat firmness acted only to destroya nation's hope to every heart alliedwho lived in sorrow and lamented diedit was a painful circumstance to dashall who was seldom severe in hisjudgments or harsh in his censures he regretted its occurrence and itoperated in some degree to rob a splendid ceremony of its magnificenceand to sever from royalty half its dignitythe preparations however were arranged upon a scale of grandeur suitedto the occasion the exterior of westminster hall and abbey presenteda most interesting appearance commodious seats were erected for theaccommodation of spectators to view the procession in its moving orderand were thronged with thousands of anxious subjects to greet theirsovereign with demonstrations of loyalty and loveit was certainly a proud day of national festivity the firing of gunsand the ringing of bells announced the progress of the coronation inits various stages to completion and in the evening hyde park wasbrilliantly and tastefully illuminated

the previous night tobreakfast at an early hour and take a gentle ride along the road witha determination to see as much as possible of the attractive amusementsof a millingmatch and to take a view as they went along of the companythey were afterwards to mingle withwe shall now said dashall as they sat down to breakfast have apeep at the lads of the ring and see a little of the real science ofboxingwe have been boxing the compass through the difficult straits of alondon life for some time replied bob and i begin to think thatwith all its variety its gaiety and its pride the most legitimate joys of life may fairly be said toexist in the countryi confess said dashall that most of the pleasures of life arecomparative and arise from contrast thus the bustle of londonheightens the serenity of the country while again the monotony of thecountry gives additional zest to the evervarying scenes of london butwhy this observation at a moment when we are in pursuit of fresh gamenay said tallyhoho i know not why but i spoke as i thought feelingas i do a desire to have a pop at the partridges as the season is nowfast approaching and having serious thoughts of shifting my

the friendly flush hit which floors theiropponentsthe morning was fine and the numerous persons who appeared travellingon the road called forth many inquiries from bobnow said he i think i recollect

presently impeded bya crowd of persons who surrounded a long cart or waggon which had justbeen overturned and had shot out a motley group of personages whowere being lifted on their legs growling and howling at this unforeseendisaster a hardfeatured sailor whose leg had been broken by the fallbrandished a splinter of the fractured limb and swore that althoughhis timbers were shivered and he had lost a leg in the service hewould not be the last in the ring but he'd be d d if he mount therubbishcart any more it is needless to observe his leg was a woodenoneupon examining the inscription on the cart it was found to contain thefollowing words household furniture building materials and lumbercarefully removed as it was ascertained that no real injury hadbeen sustained our party speedily passed the overturned vehicle andproceededthe next object of attraction was a small cart drawn by one poor animalsweating and snorting under the weight of six swells led by an old manwho seemed almost as incapable as his horse seemed unwilling to performthe journey a label on the outside of the cart intimated that itscontents was soap which created some laughter between tom and bob theman in the front

for divers weighty reasonsprincipallyfounded on a view to the profits of certain of the surrey trusts and toaccommodate the sporting circles at brighton fixed the combat to takeplace in a meadow belonging to a farmer named jarvis near this placeon this spot accordingly the ring was formed and an immense mass ofall descriptions of vehicles was admitted not much it may naturallybe supposed to the prejudice of the owner of the premises whoseagents were praiseworthily active in levying proper contributions somegentlemen however in the neighbourhood observing that the strictestdelicacy was not maintained towards the sacredness of their fencesinsisted that the place was too confined and intimated that a move mustbe made or they should make application to the magistrates and atthe same time suggested crawley downs the site of so many formerskirmishes as the most convenient spot for their accommodationin this state of things a move immediately took place and a freshring was established on the spot alluded to but in effecting this newlodgment much mortification was experienced not alone by those whoafter a dreadful drag up one of the worst byroads in england hadobtained a comfortable situation but by those who speculating on theformation of the ring had expended considerable sums in the hire ofwaggons for their purpose from the surrounding farmers the waggonsit was found impossible to move in due time and thus the new area wascomposed of such vehicles as were first to reach the appointed groundthe general confusion now was inconceivable for notwithstanding thedeparture of connoisseurs from jarvis's farm martin still maintainedhis post alleging that he was on the ground originally fixed andthat he should expect randall to meet him there in which demand

at jarvis'sfarm was suddenly arrested in his progress by an express from themaronites announcing that their champion had yielded his claim to thechoice of ground and was so anxious for the mill that he would meetrandall even in a sawpit bill gibbons arriving soon after the ringwith the assistance of many hands was quickly formed by which timetom and bob had secured themselves excellent situations to view thecombatabout twenty minutes before three randall entered the outer ringattended by general barton and mr griffiths he was attired in awhitehall upper benjamin and threw his hat into the ring amidst loudapplause in a few minutes after martin approached from an oppositedirection accompanied by mr sant and mr elliott he was also warmlygreetedthe men now passed the ropes and were assisted by their immediatefriends in peeling for action martin was attended by spring andthereon randall by harry holt and haddington jonesthe men stript well and both appeared to be in excellent health goodspirits and high condition but the symmetry of randall's bust excitedgeneral admiration and the muscular strength of his arms neck andshoulders bore testimony to his herculean qualities the whole force ofhis body in fact seem'd to be concentrated above his waistband martinstood considerably above him his arms were much longer but they wantedthat bold and imposing weight which characterized those of randall theywalked up to the scratch and shook hands in perfect good fellowshipevery man now took his station and the heroes threw themselves intotheir guardit was rumoured that martin intended to lose no time in manoeuvring butto go to work instanter this however he found was not so easily tobe effected as suggested for randall had no favour to grant and wastherefore perfectly on his guard he was all wary caution and hadclearly no intention of throwing away a chance but was evidentlywaiting for martin to commence martin once or twice made play butrandall was not skittish inclined all was war hawk randall made alefthanded hit to draw his adversary but found it would not domartin then hit right and left but was stopped randall was feeling formartin's wind but hit above his mark though not without leaving one ofa red colour which told a flattering tale randall returned with hisleft and the men got to a smart rally when randall got a konker whichtapped the claret an almost instantaneous close followed in whichrandall grasping martin round the neck with his right arm and bringinghis head to a convenient posture served out punishment with his leftthis was indeed a terrific position randall was always famous for thedreadful force of his short lefthanded hits and on this occasion theylost none of their former character martin's nob was completely in avice and while in that hopeless condition randall fibbed away with thesolid weight of the hammer of a tuckmill his aim was principally atthe neck where every blow told with horrible violence eight or tentimes did he repeat the dose and then with a violent swing threwmartin to the ground falling on him as he went with all his weightthe ring resounded with applause and jack coolly took his seatonthe knee of his second martin's friends began to look blue butstill expected the fight being young there was yet much to be doneall eyes were now turned to martin who being lifted on spring's kneein a second discovered that he was done his head fell back lifelessand all the efforts of spring to keep it straight were in vain waterwas thrown on him in abundance but without effect he was in factcompletely senseless and the halfminute having transpired thenonpareil was hailed the victorrandall appeared almost without a scratch while poor martin lay like alump of unleavened dough he was removed and bled but it was some timebefore he was conscious of his defeatnothing could exceed the astonishment which so sudden and complete afinish to the business produced the round lasted but seven minutes anda half of which four minutes and a half had elapsed before a blow wasattempted thus ended one of the most extraordinary battles between twoknown game men on the pugilistic records very heavy bets had been madeupon it in all parts of the kingdom one gentleman is said to have hadfive thousand pounds and another one thousand eight hundred guineasthe gains of the conqueror were supposed to be about a thousand poundsthe amusements of the day were concluded by a second fight betweenparish and lashbroke which proved a manly and determined contest forupwards of an hour and in which the combatants evinced considerableskill and bravery and was finally decided in favour of parish allamusement which might have been derived from this spectacle howeverwas completely destroyed by the daring outrages of an immense gang ofpickpockets who broke in the ring and closed completely up to theropes carrying with them every person of decent appearance and openlyrobbing them of their watches pocketbooks and purses and the latenessof the hour it being five o'clock and almost dark favoured thedepredatorsin the midst of this struggle tom dashall had nearly lost his fancytopper and tallyhoho was secretly eased of his clicker from thescene of tumult and confusion they were glad to escape and being againsafely seated in the topper a flash term given to a hat flicker a flash term given to a watch barouche they made the best of their way home in doing whichthey found the roads almost as much clogg'd as they were in the morningthe randallites were meritorious and flushed with good fortune linedthe publichouses on the road to wet their whistles singing andshouting his name in strains to them equally inspiring assee the conquering hero comessound your trumpets beat your drumswhile the maronites rolled along the road in sullen silence and bythe time they reached town an account of the battle was hawking aboutthe streets and songs singing to the praise of the successful combatantin all the melodious cadences of a last dying speech and confessionsuch is the promptitude of london printers poets and newsvenderswell said dashall as they reentered the house the events of thisday have completely disappointed some of the knowing onesthat may be replied bob but they have been too knowing for menotwithstanding your previous instructions however i don't regretseeing the humours of a prize ring and the next time you catch methere i must take a lesson from the man of profit and keep a wakefulwinker on the possibles really i could not help feeling astonished atthe immense number of persons assembled on such an occasionillustration page a private turnupzounds said tom tis the real centre of attraction the thingthe tippy and the twig among the lads of the fancy why it is prettygenerally known through the medium of the newspapers that a certainnobleman paid the debts of one of these pugilists amounting to lthat he might be released from newgate in order to fight a prize battleand it is not long since that the marquis of t ed e whilstentertaining a large party after dinner introduced the subject with somuch effect that a purse of guineas was subscribed among them for aturn up between two of the prime hammered who being introducedactually setto in his drawingroom for the amusement of his friendsnor is it less true that this sporting nobleman gloriously took up theconqueror as the saying is and evinced his patronage and his power atonce by actually subduing his antagonist proving to certitude that ifhis lordship would but practise this sublime art he could hardlyfail of adding to his present title that of the champion of england itis the theme of constant conversation and in many cases there is moreanxiety about contests of this sort than there is

glowingdescriptions of scenes yet unexplored at length consented to accompanyhim to belville hall upon condition that they should return again inamonth this mode of arrangement seemed perfectly satisfactory to boband a view of the panorama and a peep at the tennis court would havefinished their rambles for the day but at the latter place ofamusement and healthful exercise meeting with young

that giovanni determining to have anotherchance burst from the grasp of the arch enemy of mankind to pursuehis wonted vagaries to the no small gratification of bob who withoutactually acquitting the prisoner rejoiced at his own escapehe had however scarcely time to congratulate himself before he wasannoyed by a postman in the usual costume whom he had already seendelivering letters to the company

declaring justice wasabroad and propriety not at home he was however rather at a loss asin his last character he had not been able to meet with the turk butdetermined to resume the search in a domino having therefore equippedhimself as a spectator he again sallied forth with intention to explorethe room and for a time remained comparatively unmolested but as hecould no where find his cousin he strolled indiscriminately among thecharacters viewing whatever appeared amusing or interesting in hisway the fineness of the weather greatly animated the scene andgave increased brilliancy and effect to the illuminations whichwere disposed in a numerous variety of splendid devices representingnational trophies stars wreaths and crowns of laurel it was thefirst moment he had found an opportunity of viewing the place in whichhe had been actingthe amusements of the evening were judiciously varied and protractedby a constant succession of entertainments of various descriptions mrchains exhibited

bee from one delight to anothersipping pleasure as he went almost regretting he had not taken the lastdress first though he was every now and then importuned by mendicantsand servant girls very desirous to obtain places of all work theintroduction of a dancing bear who appeared to possess more christianqualities than his leader attracted his attention but in pressing tothe scene of action he received a floored from a bruiser in gloves whomilled indiscriminately all who came in his way till the bear took theshine out of him by a fraternal embrace and his leader very politelyasked those around which they thought the greater bear of the two uponrising bob found himself in the hands of two itinerant quack doctorseach holding an arm and each feeling for his pulse one declared thecase was mortal a dislocation of the neck had taken place and therewas no chance of preserving life except by amputation of the headthe other shook his head look'd grave pull'd out his lancet andprescribed phlebotomy and warm waterbob who had received no injury except a little contusion occasioned bythe blow seized the ignorant practitioners by the throat and knockingtheir heads together exclaimed with a stentorian voicethrow physic to the clogs i'll none on't go along bob wasrepeated again as loud and as long as before he however burst fromthose around him in pursuit of fresh game nor was he disappointed forhe presently found a dapper young clergyman in gown and surpliceand who with book in hand was fervently engaged in exhortations andendeavours to turn from the evil of their ways a drunken sailor anda hardened thief the arson of the iron chest when the group weresurrounded by a detachment of the imps and devils of giovanni in londona truly horrid and diabolical crew who by their hideous yells franticcapers violent gestures and the flaring of their torches scared theaffrighted parson from his task made his intended penitents their ownand became an almost intolerable nuisance

a style highly creditable tothe managershere they were joined by mortimer who had been as frolicsome as any impin the gardens in the character of the devil but who had lost sightof the dandy officer and the nun whom he had so ingeniously hookedtogether the wine was good and after enjoying their repast tomand mortimer enshrined themselves in dominos for the remainder ofthe evening the usual

engaged were reenjoyed in recollection notwithstandingthe preparations they were making for an excursion of another kindin the country which though not exactly to the taste of dashall wasinflexibly persevered in by tallyhohotom tried every effort in his power to prolong the appointed periodof departure in again the heart and mind of his cousin appeared tobe occupied with anticipated delights which he described in the mostglowing colours of imagination the healthful fields the enlivening foxchase and the sportive exercises of a country life were detailed withecstacy and though last not least the additional zest for the moreattractive scenes in tom's idea that would present themselves forinspection upon a return to the metropolis at length it was fibuildings at a distance where they were scarcely discernible by thenaked eye bob was delighted with the view of greenwich hospital andthe account which his cousin gave him of the establishment and upondescending they took a complete walk round this celebrated pillarmarking its decorations and reading the inscriptionit is said tom a fluted column of the doric order the total heightis feet the diameter at the base feet and the height of thecolumn feet the cone at the top with its urn are feet theheight of the massy pedestal is feet there are steps insidebut continued he ait is really a great pity that this beautifulmonument should be in such a confined situation for in a properplace it would form one of the most striking objects of the kind thatarchitecture is capable of producingthe inscription it is true continued dashall had better be erasedit contains a libel or more properly a lie which almost contradictsitself for no rational being can entertain the notion that thecatholics or indeed any religious sect could wilfully have perpetratedso horrible a deed as this pillar was intended to impute to them norcan so much credit be given to human foresight as for it to be concludedthat a fire which broke out in a single house could upon this ratherthan upon other occasions have extended its ravages in so extraordinarya manner while we arc on the spot we will take a peep at a curious pieceof antiquity not that i am so great a lover of such curiosities but itwould appear almost unpardonable for you to have been in london withoutseeing london stonei have heard of it said tallyhoho and if we are near let us have aviewcome on then said dashall this same london stone is at presentfixed close under the south wall of st swithin's church cannonstreet it has by some been supposed of british origin a kind of solemnboundary or some other object probably of a religious nature whichthrough every change and convulsion of the state has been preserved withreverential care but this is the very place said hebob stared about him with surprise to discover this curious andapparently valuable relic without finding it till at length hiscousin directed his attention to the spot which at present is under apitchingblock or restingplace for persons carrying heavy loads andalmost burst into laughter for he had raised his cousin's expectationby the previous descriptionhow said tallyhoho and is this your curiosityeven so replied tom that is the celebrated london stone itformerly stood nearer the middle of the street was placed deep in theground and strongly fixed with iron bars according to account thefirst mention of it was in the reign of athelstan king of the westsaxons and it has been usually viewed by our antiquaries as a militarystone from which the romans began the computation of their miles aconjecture which certainly appears very reasonable not only from thediscovery of the roman road after the year running directly tothis stone from watling street but from the exact coincidence which itsdistance bears with the neighbouring station mentioned in antoine'sitinerary the principal of whose journeys either begin or end withlondonthe sound of a horn interrupted this conversationapropos said tom we can take the post office in our way a place ofconsiderable importance so allonsthey now pursued their way to lombard streetthis collection of buildings said dashall as they enteredimportant as its concerns are to the nation claims no praise as abuilding it stands behind lombard street from which on thesouth side of the street there is a passage leading to it under anarched gatewaya plan has however been adopted for erecting a building worthy ofthis great establishment on the site now called st martin'slegrandand to improve the access to it by pulling down the east ends of newgatestreet and paternosterrow it is now proceeding rapidlythe postoffice system is however one of the most perfect regulationsof finance and convenience existing under any government it hasgradually been brought to its present perfection being at first in thehands of individuals and replete with abuses in its present form itnot only supplies the government with a great revenue but accomplishesthat by means highly beneficial to the persons contributingthe postoffice is the most important spot on the surface of the globeit receives information from all countries it distributes instructionsto the antipodes it connects together more numerous and distantinterests of men than any similar establishment it is in the highestdegree hitherto realized the seat of terrestrial perception andvolition the brain of the whole earth and hitherto it has been in anarrow valley misshapen even to deformity and scarcely accessible tothe few mail coaches which collect there for their nightly freightsthe present postoffice was erected in but great additions havebeen made to it from time to time though the whole is disjointed andinconvenientthe mode of carrying letters by the general post was greatly improveda few years since by a most admirable plan invented by mr palmerpreviously to its adoption letters were conveyed by carts withoutprotection from robbery and subject to delays at present they arecarried according to mr palmer's plan by coaches distinguishedby the name of mailcoaches provided with a wellarmed guard andforwarded at the rate of eight miles an hour including stoppagesgovernment contracts with coachkeepers merely for carrying the mailthe coachowner making a profitable business besides of carryingpassengers and parcels it is not easy to imagine a combination ofdifferent interests to one purpose more complete than this thewretched situation however of the horses on account of the lengthof the stages which they are frequently driven is a disgrace to thecharacter of the british nation and requires the interference ofthe legislature no stage should exceed twelve miles in lengththe rapidity of this mode of conveyance is unequalled in any countryand the present rate of charge for each passenger is little more thansixpence per milehouses having boxes for receiving letters before five o'clock areopen in every part of the metropolis and after that hour bellmencollect the letters during another hour receiving a fee of one pennyfor each letter but at the general postoffice in lombard streetletters are received till seven o'clock after which time till half anhour after seven a fee of sixpence must be paid and from half afterseven till a quarter before eight the postage must also be paid aswell as the fee of sixpencewell said tallyhoho for a place of such public utility and constantresort i must confess i expected to see a building of the mostmagnificent kind but i am also puzzled to conceive how such extensivebusiness can be carried on with so much regularity as it isyour observation replied his cousin exactly coincides with thatof many others but you will some day or other be as much surprisedon other subjects for there are places in london where mercantile andlegal business is conducted in situations of obscurity of which you canhave no conception but as a national establishment though its internalregulations are good its external appearance is no recommendation toitbut come let us proceed towards home i have a call or two to makeon the road for as we depart quickly for the open fields and are tobid adieu to london smoke as well as london stone we have but littletime to spare so let us post awaybob alive to this subject did not require a second hint but takingthe arm of dashall they proceeded along cheapside made a call atmortimer's the gunsmith's on lydgate hill provided themselves withallnecessary shooting apparatus and tom ever mindful of the varietywhich he conceived would be needful to render rusticity agreeable ontheir way purchased a pair of boxing gloves a backgammon board andother amusing articles to provide as he said against a rainy dayon arrival at home they were presented with a letter from sparkleannouncing his arrival at his new mansion and expressing a hope that heshould have the pleasure of meeting his friends within a day ortwo expatiating with great apparent delight upon the happiness of hisown situation and promising lots of amusement in detailing to them theevents of his peregrinations this operated as an additional spur to thespeed of their departure and it was agreed that they should start thenext morningi don't know said bob whether i should really like a continuedlife in london i have seen many of its comforts and many of itsinconveniences then replied tom you may certainly by theexercise of your reason and the decision of your judgment upon maturereflection strike the balance and if you do not give it in favour ofthe former i shall

the pleasures and amusements of his visitorsand belville hall presented a scene of festive hospitality at oncecreditable to its liberal owner and gratifying to the numerous gentryof the surrounding

nor thoseevervarying delights produced amid the busy hum of men where everystreet is replete with incident and character and every hour fraughtwith adventuresatiety had now evidently obtruded itself amid the party and itsattendants lassitude and restlessness were not long in bringing up therear the impression already made upon the mind of bob by the cursoryview he had taken of life in london was indelible and it requiredlittle persuasion on the part of his cousin the hon tom dashallto induce him again to return to scenes of so much delight and whichafforded such inexhaustible stores of amusement to an ardent andyouthful curiositya return to the metropolis having therefore been mutually agreedupon and every previous arrangement being completed the squire oncemore abdicated for a season his paternal domains and accompanied byhis cousin dashall and the whole cidevant party of belville hallarrived safe at the elegant mansion of the latter where they planneda new system of

toanswer the complaint of a gentleman for unlawfully detaininghis luggage under the following circumstances thecomplainant stated that on thursday evening last on hisarrival in town from aberdeen he went to the white horsecellar piccadilly but the house being full he wasrecommended to the st petersburg hotel in dover streetwhere having taken some refreshment and wrote a letter hewent to bed and on the following morning after breakfasthe desired the waiter to bring him his bill which he didand the first item that presented itself was the moderatecharge of one pound ten shillings for his bed and thenfollowed amongst many others sixpence for a pen ashilling for wax a shilling for the light and two andsixpence for other lights so that the bill amounted in thewhole to the sum of two pounds one shilling for his night'slodging to this very exorbitant charge he had refused tosubmit in consequence of which he had been put to greatinconvenience by the detention of his luggage themagistrate animadverted with much severity on suchextravagant charges on the part of the tavernkeeper andadvised that upon the gentleman paying fifteen shillingsthe things might be immediately delivered up to theseterms however mrs hickinbottom refused to accede addingat the same time that the gentleman had only been chargedthe regular prices of the house and that she should insistupon the whole amount of the bill being paid for that thepersons who were in the habit of coming to their house neverobjected to such the regular price of their lodgings beingten guineas per week the magistrate lamented that he hadno power to enforce the things being given up but herecommended the complainant to bring an action against thetavernkeeper for the detention these were the observations directed by dashall to his friendas they passed one morning the hotel de la sabloniere in leicestersquaredoubtless he continued in those places of affluent resort theaccommodations are in the first style of excellence yet

charges and pleasurable inthe variety of its visitors where i might at will extend or abridgemy evening intercourse and in the retirement of my own apartment feelmyself more at home than in the vacuum of an hotelthe attention of our perambulators in passing through the square wasattracted by a fine boy apparently about eight years of age dressed inmourning who at the door of brunet's hotel was endeavouring withallhis little strength and influence to oppose the egress of a largenewfoundland dog that indignant of restraint seemed desirous in astrange land of introducing himself to canine good fellowship theboy whose large dark eyes were full of animation and his countenancethough bronzed interestingly expressive remonstrated with the dog inthe french language the animal does not understand

thatreason i love the english and am much fonder of talking their languagethan my own there was something extremely captivating in the boy thedog now struggling for freedom was nearly effecting his releasewhen the two friends interposed their assistance and secured thepremeditating fugitive at the moment when to inquire the cause of thebustle the father of the child made his appearance in the personof field marshal count bertrand the count possessing all thecharacteristics of a gentleman acknowledged politely the kind attentionof the strangers to his son while on the other hand they returnedhis obeisance with the due respect excited by his uniform friendship andundeviating attachment to greatness in adversity the discerning eyeof field marshal bertrand justly appreciated the superior rank of thestrangers to whom he observed that during the short period he had thenbeen in england he had experienced much courtesy of which he shouldalways retain a grateful recollection this accidental interview wascreative of reciprocal satisfaction and the parties separated notwithout an invitation on the part of the boy that his newly foundacquaintances would again visit the friends of

for him universal esteem and the king of france is toogenerous to withhold amidst the general feeling his approbationpassing through long acre in their progress towards the british museumto which national establishment they had cards of admission the twofriends were intercepted in their way by a concourse at a coachmaker'sshop fronting which stood a chariot carefully matted round thebody firmly sewed together and the wheels enveloped in haybandspreparatory to its being sent into the country scarcely had theseprecautionary measures of safety been completed when a shrill cryas if by a child inside the vehicle was heard loud and continuationwhich after the lapse of some minutes broke out into the urgent andreiterated exclamation of let me out i shall be suffocated praylet me outthe workmen who had packed up the carriage stared at each other inmute and appalling astonishment they felt conscious that no child waswithin the vehicle and when at last they recovered from the stupor ofamazement they resisted the importunity of the multitude to strip thechariot and manfully swore that if any one was inside it must bethedevil himself or one of his imps and no human or visible beingwhatsoeversome of the multitude were inclined to a similar opinion thecrowd increased and the most intense interest was depicted in everycountenance when the cry of let me out i shall die for heaven'ssake let me out was audibly and vehemently again and again repeatedthe impatient multitude now began to cut away the matting when theworkmen apprehensive that the carriage might sustain some damage fromthe impetuosity of their proceedings took upon themselves the act ofdismantling the mysterious machine during which operation the cry oflet me out became more and more clamorously importunate at lastthe vehicle was laid bare and its door thrown open when to the utteramazement of the crowd no child was there no trace was to be seen ofaught human or superhuman the assemblage gazed on the vacantspace from whence the sounds had emanated in confusion and dismayduring this momentary suspense in which the country squireparticipated a voice from some invisible agent as if descending thesteps of the carriage exclaimed thank you my good friends i am verymuch obliged to you i shall now go home and where my home is you willall know byandbywith the exception of dashall and

most ingenious hoax of any he had everwitnessed and that he would not have missed on any considerationwhatsoever the pleasure of enjoying it the devil in long acre ishall never forget it exclaimed the animated cousin of the staring anddiscomfited squireexplain explain reiterated the squire impatientlyyou shall have it in one wordanswered dashall ventriloquism this hoax was actually practised by a ventriloquist in themanner described it certainly is of a less offensive naturethan that of many others which have been successfullybrought forward in the metropolis the offspring of follyand idleness a fellow some years ago certainly not ofinfinite humour considering an elderly maiden lady ofberne street a fit and proper subject on whom toexercise his wit was at the trouble of writing a vastnumber of letters to tradesmen and others magistrates andprofessional men ordering from the former various goodsand requiring the advice in a case of emergency of thelatter appointing the same hour to all of attendance sothat in fact at the time mentioned the street to theannoyonce and astonishment of its inhabitants was crowdedwith a motley group of visitants equestrian and pedestrianall eagerly pressing forward to their destination the oldlady's place of residence in the heterogeneous assemblagethere were seen tradesmen of all denominations accompaniedby their porters bearing various articles of householdfurniture counsellors anticipating fees lawyers engagedto execute the last will and testament of the heroine of thedrama and not the least conspicuous an undertakerpreceded by his man with a coffin and to crown the wholethough last not least in our esteem the then lord mayor oflondon who at the eager desire of the old lady had witha commendable feeling of humanity left his civic

altogether prudent his revealing it to his alarmed andcredulous auditorya ventriloquist observed the squire is so little known in thecountry that i had lost all reminiscence of his surprising powershowever i shall in future from the occurrence of today resistthe obtrusion of superstition and in all cases of doubtful dilemma'remember the devil in long acrelwell resolved answered dashall and in a few minutes theygained great russel street bloomsbury without further incident orinterruption the child in the hat not long since a waggoner comingto town with a load of hay was overtaken by a stranger whoentered into familiar conversation with him they had notproneeded far when to the great terror of giles jolt aplaintive cry apparently that of a child issued from thewaggon didst hear that

the cry stillcontinuing but when at last he ascertained that theassumed infantine plaint was all a delusion his hair stooderect with horror and running rapidly from his companionannounced that he had been associated on the road by thedevil for that none else could play him such a trick itwas not without great difficulty that the people to whom hetold this strange story prevailed on him to return at lastto his waggon and horses he did so with manifestreluctance to his indescribable relief his infernalcompanion hail vanished in the person of the ventriloquistand jolt still believes in the supernatural visitation amongst the literary and scientific institutions of the metropolisthe british museum situated in great russel street bloomsbury standspreeminententering the spacious court our two friends found a party in waitingfor the conductor of the individuals composing this party thereconnoitering eye of dashall observed a trio from whence heanticipated considerable amusement it was a family triumvirate formedof an old bachelor whose cent per cent ideas predominated over everyother wheresoever situated or howsoever employed his maiden sisterprim starch and antiquated and their hopeful nephew acomplete coxcomb that is in full possession of the requisiteconcomitants ignorance and impudence and arrayed in the first style ofthe most exquisite dandyism this delectable triumviri had emerged fromtheir chaotic recess in harbingerlane the exquisite to exhibit hissweet person along with the other curiosities of the museum his maidenaunt to see as she expressed it the hegipsyian munimentscovered with kerrygleefix and her brother to ascertain whetherindependent of outlandish baubles gimcracks and gewgaws there was anythingof substantiality with which to enhance the per contra side in theaccount current between the british museum and the publicattaching themselves to this respectable trio dashall and tallyhohofollowed with the other visitants the guide whose duty it thatday was to point out the various curiosities of this great nationalinstitutionthe british museum was established by act of parliament in inpursuance of the will of sir hans sloane who left his museum tothe nation on condition that parliament should pay l to hisexecutors and purchase a house sufficiently commodious for it theparliament acted with great liberality on the occasion several othervaluable collections were united to that of sir hans sloane and thewhole establishment was completed for the sum of l raised bylottery at the institution of this grand treasury of learning itwas proposed that a competent part of l the annual sum granted byparliament for the support of the house should be appropriated forthe purchase of new books but the salaries necessary for the officerstogether with the contingent expenses have always exceeded theallowance so that the trustees have been repeatedly obliged tomake application to defray the necessary chargesmr timothy surety the before mentioned harbingerlane residentof cent per cent rumination his accomplished sister tabitha hisexquisite nephew jasper and the redoubtable heroes of our eventfulhistory were now associated in one party and the remaining visitantswere sociably amalgamated in another and each having its separateconductor both proceeded to the inspection of the first and mostvaluable collection in the universeillustration pages british museumon entering the gate the first objects which attracted attentionwere two large sheds defending from the inclemency of the seasons acollection of egyptian monuments the whole of which were taken fromthe french at alexandria in the last war the most curious of theseperhaps is the large sarcophagus beneath the shed to the left whichhas been considered as the exterior coffin of alexander the great usedat his final interment it is formed of variegated marble and as mrstabitha surety observed was covered with kerrygleefix nephew jasper said his uncle you are better acquainted with thenomenclature i think you call it of them there thingumbobs than iam what is the name of this heremy dear sir rejoined the exquisite this here is called a sark o'fergus implying the domicile or rather the windingsheet of thedead as the sark or chemise wound itself round the fair forms of thedaughters of o'fegus a highland chieftain from whom descended philipof macedon father of alexander the great and thence originated thename subsequently given by the highland laird's successors to thedormitory of the dead the sark o fergus or in the corruption of modernorthography sarcophagustimothy surety cast an approving glance towards his nephew andwhispering dashall my nephew sir apparently a puppy sir but wellinformed nevertheless what think you of his definition of that hardword is he not i mean my nephew jaz a most extraordinary young mansuperlatively so answered dashall and i think you are happy inbearing affinity to a young man of such transcendent acquirementsd n his acquirements exclaimed timothy would you think itthey are of no use in the way of trade and though i have given him manyan opportunity of doing well he knows no more of keeping a set of booksby doubleentry than timothy surety does of keeping a pack of houndswho was never twenty miles beyond the hearing of bow bells in all hislifetimethis important communication having been made apart from therecognition of the aunt and nephew passed on their approachunanswered and dashall and his friend remained in doubt whether or notthe nephew in his late definition of the word sarcophagus was injest or earnest tallyhoho inclined to think that he was hoaxing the oldgentleman on the other hand his cousin bethought himself that theapparent ingenuity of jaz's definition was attributable entirely to hisignorancehere also were two statues of roman workmanship supposed to be thoseof marcus aurelius and severus ancient but evidently of provincialsculpturemrs tabitha shading her eyes with her fan and casting a glance askewat the two naked figures which exhibited the perfection of symmetryenquired of her nephew who they were meant to representhis answer was equally eccentric with that accorded to his uncle on thesubject of the sarcophagusmy dear madam said jaz these two figures are consanguineous tothose of gog and magog in guildhall being the lineal descendants ofthese mighty associates of the livery of londonbut jaz rejoined the antique dame i always understood thatmessieurs gog and magog derived their origin from quite a differentfamilyaunt of mine responded jaz the lofty rubicund civic baronetshall not be shorn of his beams he claims the same honour withhis brainless brothers before ushe is a scion of the same tree sirwllm the twin brothers of guildhall and these two sedate gentlemenof stone all boast the honour of the same extractionbehind them on the right was a ram's head of very curious workmanshipfrom thebesperhaps sir said mrs tabitha graciously addressing herself to'squire tallyhoho you can inform us what may be the import of thissingular exhibitionon my honour madam answered the squire i cannot satisfactorilyresolve the enquiry i am a country gentleman and thoughconversant with rains and rams horns in my own neighbourhood have noknowledge of them with reference to the connexion of the latter with thecitizens of london or westminsterjaz again assumed the office of expositor my very reverend auntsaid jaz i must prolegomena the required explanation with a simpleanecdotewhen charles the second returned from one of his northern toursaccompanied by the earl of rochester he passed through shoreditch oneach side the road was a huge pile of rams horns for what purposetradition saith not what is the meaning of all this asked theking pointing towards the symbolic i know not rejoined rochesterunless it implies that the citizens of london have laid their headstogether to welcome your majesty's return in commemoration of thiswitticism the ram's head is to the citizens of london a prominentfeature of exhibition in the british museumthis interpretation raised a laugh at the expense of timothy suretywho nevertheless bore it with great good humour being a bachelor andconsequently not within the scope of that ridicule on the basis of whichwas founded the present sarcastic fabricit was now obvious to dash all and his friend that this young manjasper surety was not altogether the ignoramus at first presumed theyhad already been entertained by his remarks and his annotations wereof a description to warrant the expectancy of further amusement in theprogress of their inspectionfrom the hall the visitors were led through an iron gateway to thegreat staircase opposite the bottom of which is preserved a model inmahogany exhibiting the method used by mr milne in constructing theworks of blacksmiths bridge and beneath it are some curious fragmentsfrom the giant's causeway in irelandthese fragments however highly estimated by the naturalist and theantiquary were held in derision by the worldlyminded tim suretywho exclaimed against the folly of expending money in the purchase ofarticles of no intrinsic value calculated only to gratify the curiosityof those inquisitive idlers who affect their admiration of everyuninteresting production of nature and neglect the pursuit of the mainchance so necessary in realizing the comforts of life these sordid ideas were opposed by dashall and the squire towhom they seemed particularly directed mrs tabitha smiled a graciousacquiescence in the sentiments of the two strangers and jasperexpressed his regret that nuncle was not gifted and fated as midas ofancient times who transformed every thing that he touched into goldthe egyptian and etruscan antiquities next attracted the attention ofthe visitors over a doorway in this room is a fine portrait of sirwilliam hamilton painted by sir joshua reynolds dashall and tallyhohoremarked with enthusiasm on these beautiful relics of the sculptureof former ages several of which were mutilated and disfigured by thedilapidation of time and accident of the company present there stoodon the left a diminutive elderly gentleman in the act of contemplatingthe fragment of a statue in a posterior position and which certainlyexhibited somewhat of a ludicrous appearance on the right theexquisite jasper pointed out with the selfsufficiency of an amateurthe masculine symmetry of a colossian statue to his aunt of antiquatedvirginity whose maiden purity recoiling from the view of notationseemed to say jaz wrap an apron round him while in the foregroundstood the rotundity form of timothy surety who declared after acursory and contemptuous glance at the venerable representatives ofmythology that with the exception of the portrait of sir williamhamilton there was not in the room an object worth looking at and asfor them there ancient statutes such was his vernacular idiom andharbinger barbarism i would not give twopence for the whole of thishere collection if it was never for nothing else than to set them up asscarecrows in the garden of my country house at edmontonjasper whispered his aunt that nuncks was a vile bore and thesacrilegious declaration gave great offence to the diminutive gentlemanaforesaid who hesitated not in pronouncing timothy surety destitute oftaste and vertu to which accusation timothy rearing his squat formto its utmost altitude indignantly replied that there was not analderman in the city of london of better taste than himself in thequalities of callipash and calliope and that if the little penmenpresumed again to asperse his virtue he would bring an action againsthim tor slander and defamation of character the minikin man gavetimothy a glance of ineffable disdain and left the room mrs tabitha in the full consciousness of her superior acquirements nowdirected a lecture of edification to her brother who however manfullyresisted her interference and swore that where his taste andvirtue were called in question he would not submit to any she in theuniversemrs tabitha finding that on the present occasion her usual successwould not predominate suspended like a skilful manoeuvresunavailable attack and turning to her nephew variety ofshapes than proteus and that he had been only fifty times if not moreconfined in different houses of correction as an incorrigible rogueand vagabond from one of which he had recently contrived to effect hisescape the officer now bore off his prize in triumph while dashallhitherto the most observant of all observers sustained the laughof his cousin at the knowing one deceived with great good humour anddashall adverting to his opinion so confidently expressed there canbe no deception here declared that in london it was impossible toguard in every instance against fraud where it is frequently practisedwith so little appearance of impositionthe two friends now bent their course towards covent garden whichreaching without additional incident they wiled away an hour atrobins's much to their satisfaction that gentleman in his professionalcapacity generally attracts in an eminent degree the attention of hisvisitors by his professional politeness so that he seldom fails toput off an article to advantage and yet he rarely resorts to the puffdirect and never indulges in the puff figurative so much practised byhis renowned predecessor the late knight of the hammer christie theelder who by the superabundance of his rhetorical flurishes wasaccustomed from his elevated rostrum to edify and amuse his admiringauditoryof the immense revenues accruing to his grace the duke of bedfordnot the least important is that derived from covent garden market asproprietor of the ground from every possessor of a shed or stall andfrom all who take their station as venders in the market a rent ispayable to his grace and collected weekly considering thereforethe vast number of occupants the aggregate rental must be of the firstmagnitude his grace is a humane landlord and his numerous tenantryof covent garden are always ready to join in general eulogium on hisprivate worth as is the nation at large on the patriotism of his publiccharacterdashall conducted his friend through every part of the market amidst aredundancy of fruit flowers roots and vegetables native and exoticin variety and profusion exciting the merited admiration of thesquire who observed and perhaps justly that this celebrated emporiumunquestionably is not excelled by any other of a similar description inthe universe the late mr christie having at one time a small tract ofland under the hammer expatiated at great length on itshighly improved state the exuberant beauties with whichnature had adorned this terrestrial paradise and moreparticularly specified a delightful hanging wooda gentleman unacquainted with mr christie's happy talentat exaggerated description became the highest bidder paidhis deposit and posted down into essex to examine his newpurchase when to his great surprise and disappointment hefound no part of the description realized the promisedparadise having faded into an airy vision and left not awreck behind the irritated purchaser immediately returnedto town and warmly expostulated with the auctioneer on theinjury he had sustained by unfounded representation and asto a hanging wood sir there is not the shadow of a tree onthe spot i beg your pardon sir said the pertinaciouseulogist you must certainly have overlooked the gibbet onthe common and if that is not a hanging wood i know notwhat it isanother of mr christie's flights of fancy may not unaptlybe termed the puff poetical at an auction of picturesdwelling in his usual strain of eulogium on the unparalleledexcellence of a fulllength portrait without his producingthe desired effect gentlemen said he cannot injusticeto this sublime art permit this most invaluablepainting to pass from under the hammer without againsoliciting the honour of your attention to its manifoldbeauties gentlemen it only wants the touch of prometheusto start from the canvass and fall bidding proceeding into leicester square the very extraordinaryproduction of female genius miss logwood's gallery of needleworkpromised a gratification to the squire exceeding in novelty any thingwhich he had hitherto witnessed in the metropolis the twofriends accordingly entered and the anticipations of tallyhoho weresuperabundantly realizedthis exhibition consists of seventyfive exquisite copies in needleworkof the finest pictures of the english and foreign schools possessingall the correct drawing just colouring light and shade of the originalpictures from whence they are taken and to which in point of effectthey are in no degree inferiorfrom the door in leicester square the visitants entered the principalroom a fine gallery of excellent proportions hung with scarletbroadcloth gold bullion tassels and greek borders the appearancethus given to the room is pleasing and indicated to the squire a stillmore superior attraction his cousin dashall had frequently inspectedthis celebrated exhibition but to tallyhoho it was entirely newon one side of this room the pictures are hung and have a guard infront to keep the company at the requisite distance and for preservingthemturning to the left a long and obscure passage prepares the mindand leads to the cell of a prison on looking into which is seen thebeautiful lady jane gray visited by the abbot and keeper of the towerthe night before her executionthis scene particularly elicited the squire's admiration the deceptionof the whole he observed was most beautiful and not exceeded byany work from the pencil of the painter that he had ever witnesseda little

themagistrates of westminster provisionally commit those who are supposedto be guilty of crimes ingress was without much difficulty obtainedand the two friends proceeded to a survey of human nature in its mostdegraded state where amidst the consciousness of infamy and themiseries of privation apathy seemed the predominant feeling with theseoutcasts of society and reflection on the past or anticipation of thefuture was absorbed in the vacuum of insensibility reckless of hisdestiny here the manacled felon wore with his gyves the semblanceof the most perfect indifference and the seriousness of usefulretrospection was lost in the levity of frivolous amusement apart fromthe other prisoners was seated a recluse whose appearance excited theattention of the two visitants a deep cloud of dejection overshadowedhis features and he seemed studiously to keep aloof from theobstreperous revelry of his fellowcaptives there was in his mannera something inducing a feeling of commiseration which could not beextended to his callous companions in adversity his decayedhabiliment indicated from its formation and texture that he had seenbetter days and his voluntary seclusion confirmed the idea that hehad not been accustomed to his present humiliating intercourse hisintenseness of thought precluded the knowledge of approximation on hisprivacy until our two friends stood before him he immediately rosemade his obeisance and was about to retire when mr dashall withhis characteristic benevolence begged the favour of a few momentsconversationi am gratified he observed in perceiving one exception to thegeneral turpitude of feeling which seems to pervade this place andi trust that your case of distress is not of a nature to precludethe influence of hope in sustaining your mind against the pressure ofdespondencythe cause of my confinement answered the prisoner is originallythat of debt although perverted into crime by an unprincipledrelentless creditor destined to the misery of losing a beloved wifeand child and subsequently assailed by the minor calamity of pecuniaryembarrassment i inevitably contracted a few weeks arrears of rent tothe rigid occupant of the house wherein i held my humble apartmentwhen returned one night to my cheerless domicil my irascible landlordin the plenitude of ignorance and malevolence gave me in charge of asapient guardian of the night who without any enquiry into the natureof my offence conducted me to the watchhouse where i was presentlyconfronted with my creditor who accused me of the heinous crime ofgetting into his debt the constable very properly refused to takecognizance of a charge so ridiculous but unluckily observing that hadi been brought there on complaint of an assault he would in that casehave felt warranted in my detention my persecutor seized on the ideawith avidity and made a declaration to that effect although evidentlyno such thought had in the first instance occurred to him well knowingthe accusation to be grossly unfounded this happened on a saturdaynight and i remained in dress and without sustenance until thefollowing monday when i was held before a magistrate the allegedassault was positively sworn to and maugre my statement of thesuspicious inconsistent conduct of my prosecutor i was immured in thelockup house for the remainder of the day on the affidavit of perjury and in the evening placed under the friendly care of thegovernor of tothillfields bridewell to abide the issue at the nextwestminster sessionsthis is a most extraordinary affair said the squire and what do youconjecture may be the resultthe pertinacity of my respectable prosecutor said the captive mightprobably induce him to procure the aid of some of his conscientiousisraelitish brethren whom never saw towards substantiating theaforesaid assault by manfully swearing to the fact but as i have nodesire of exhibiting myself through the streets linked to a chain offelons on our way to the sessions house i believe i shall contriveto pay the debt due to the perjured scoundrel which will ensure myenlargement and let the devil in due season take his ownmay we enquire said dashall without the imputation of impertinentinquisitiveness what has been the nature of your pursuits in lifemultitudinous replied the other my life has been so repletewith adventure and adversity in all its varieties and in its futureprospects so unpropitious of happiness that existence has long ceasedto be desirable and had i not possessed a more than common portion ofphilosophic resignation i must have yielded to despair butwhen all the blandishments of life are gone the coward sneaks todeath the brave live onthirty years ago i came to london buoyant of youth and hope torealize a competency although i knew not by what means the grandobject was to be attained yet it occurred to me that i might be equallysuccessful with others of my country who unaided by recommendation andunited with the means of speculation had accumulated fortunes inthis fruitful metropolis and of whom fifteen years ago one eminentlyfortunate adventurer from the north filled the civic chair withcommensurate political zeal and abilitysome are born great others achieve greatness and some have greatnessthrust upon themwell sir what can be said of it i was without the pale of fortunealthough several of my schoolmates who had established themselvesin london acquired by dint of perseverance parsimony and servilityaffluent circumstances convinced however that i was notdestined to acquire wealth and honour and being unsolved even withthe necessaries of life i abandoned in london all hope of success andemigrated to ireland where i held for several years the situation ofclerk to a respectable justice of the quorum in this situation i livedwell and the perquisites of office which were regularly productive onthe return of every fair and market day for taking examinations of thepeace and filling up warrants of apprehension against the perpetratorsof broken heads and bloody noses consoled me in my voluntary exilefrom real life in london i was in all respects regarded as one of thefamily had a horse at my command visited in friendly intimacy theneighbouring gentry and above all enjoyed the eccentricities of thelower irish most particularly so when before his honour detailing tohis great annoyance a story of an hour long

incident occurred that hadnearly terminated all my then cares in this life past present and tocomein my capacity as clerk or secretary i had written one morning forthe worthy magistrate two letters both containing remittances the onel and the other l in bank of ireland bills we were situated atthe distance of fifteen miles from the nearest market town and as thetimes were perilous and my employer unwilling to entrust property to theprecarious conveyance of subordinate agency he requested that i wouldtake a morning ride and with my own hands deliver these letters atthe postoffice accordingly i set out and had arrived to within threemiles of my destination when my further progress was opposed by twomen in green uniform who with supported arms and fixed bayonetswere pacing the road to and fro as sentinels in a very steady andsoldierlike manner on the challenge of one of these fellows with armsat port demanding the countersign i answered that i had none to givethat i was travelling on lawful business to the next town and requiredto know by what authority he stopt me on the king's highway by thepowers he exclaimed this is my authority then and immediatelybrought his musket to the charge against the chest of my horse i nowlearnt that the town had been taken possession of that morning by adivision of the army of the people for so the insurgents had styledthemselves you may turn your nag homewards if you choose said thesentry but if you persist in going into the town i must pass you bythe different outposts to the officer on duty the business in whichi was engaged not admitting of delay i preferred advancing and wasushered ultimately to the notice of the captain of the guard whovery kindly informed me that his general would certainly order me to behanged as a spy unless i could exhibit good proof of the contrary withthis comfortable assurance i was forthwith introduced into the presenceof the rebel general he was a portly goodlooking man apparently aboutthe age of forty not more wore a green uniform with gold embroideryand was engaged in signing dispatches which his secretary successivelysealed and superscribed his staff were in attendance and aprovostmarshal in waiting to perform the office of summary execution onthose to whom the general might attach suspicion the insurgent leadernow enquiring with much austerity my name profession fromwhence i came the object of my coming and lastly whether or not iwas previously aware of the town being in possession of the army of thepeople i answered these interrogatories by propounding the questionwho the gentleman was to whom i had the honour of addressing myselfand under what authority i was considered amenable to his inquisitionanswer my enquiries sir he replied without the impertinency ofidle circumlocution otherwise i shall consider you as a spy and myprovostmarshal shall instantly perform on your person the duties ofhis office i now resorted to my letters i had no other alternativebetween existence and annihilation explaining therefore who iwas and by whom employed these letters i added are each in myhandwriting and both contain remittances i came to this town for thesole purpose of putting them into the postoffice and i was not awareuntil informed by your scouts that the place was in the occupation ofan enemy he deigned not a reply farther than pointing to one ofthe letters and demanding to know the amount of the bill which itenveloped i answered one hundred and fifty pounds he immediatelybroke the seal examined the bill and found that it was correct nowsir he continued sit down and write from my dictation he dictatedfrom the letter which he had opened and when i had finished thecopy compared it next with the original characters expressed hissatisfaction at their identity and returning the letters licensed mydeparture when and to where i list observing that i was fortunate inhaving had with me those testimonials of business otherwise said heyour appearance under circumstances of suspicion might have led to afatal result you may be assured gentlemen continued the narratorthat i did not prolong my stay in the town beyond the shortestrequisite period two mounted dragoons by order of their generalescorted me past the outposts and i reached home in safety theseoccurrences took place on a saturday the triumph of the insurgenttroops was of short duration they were attacked that same night by theking's forces discomfited and their daring chieftain taken prisoneron the monday following his head stuck upon a pike surmounted themarkethouse of belfast the scenes of anarchy and desperation in whichthat unfortunate country became now involved rendered it no verydesirable residence i therefore procured a passport bid adieu to theemerald isle erin ma vorneen shan leet go brag and once more returnedto london to experience a renewal of that misfortune by which i havewith little interval been hitherto accompanied during the whole periodof my eventful lifethe two strangers had listened to the narrative with mingled sensationsof compassion and surprise the one feeling excited by the peculiaritythe other by the pertinacity of his misfortunes when their cogitationswere interrupted by a dissonant clamour amongst the prisoners who itappeared had united in enmity against an unlucky individual whom theywere dragging towards the discipline of the pump with all the eagernessof inflexible vengeanceon enquiry into the origin of this uproar it was ascertained that oneof the prisoners under a charge of slight assault had been visited bythis fellow who affecting to commiserate his situation proposed toarrange matters with his prosecutor for his immediate release withother offers of gratuitous assistance this pretended friend wasrecognised by one of the prisoners as a kidnappera kidnapper or crimp is one of those fellows of abandoned principleswho enter into the pay of the east india company in order

these gentry assumethe character of officers others of serjeants drummers and recruitswithout the least shadow of commission among them they have manyways of inveigling the artless and unthinking one or two of thesekidnappers dressed as countrymen go five or six miles out of town tomeet the waggons and stages and enquire if john suchaone is come upwhich is answered in the negative no such person being known theythen enter into discourse with the countrymen and being perfectlycomplaisant engage attention and by the time they get to london learntheir occupations and business to town whether they are in search ofplaces trades or intend to return home again which intelligencethey in general profit by coming to the place of rendezvous the kidnappers propose a pint of porter which being agreed on they enterthe house where their companions are in waiting enjoy themselves overflowingbowls and exhilarating their spirits with loyal toasts andsongs begin their business by enquiring who is willing to serve hismajesty the countryman if inclined thereto is generally deceived ifhis desire is for the guards or any other particular regiment thereare at hand mock serjeants and privates who will swear they belong tothe corps and the dupe is trepanned for the east indies hurried onboarda ship or kept in some dismal place of security till a sufficientnumber is collected and an opportunity serves to send them awayon the other hand should the countryman be averse to enlisting andtalk of going away these crimps will swear that he has received ashilling or more of the bountymoney insisting that they saw him putthe money into such and such a pocket it is in vain that the countrymandenies having received it search is made money found and he iscompelled to submit or pay the smartothers

forward to the place ofpunishment but the tumultuary assemblage were disappointed in theiranticipated vengeance by the interposition of the turnkeys and thepretended friend escaped the meditated castigationobserve again said the narrator that dashing young fellow arrayedin the first style of dandyismmy good fellow interrupted bob he is not i should think one ofthe community he has apparently the manners of the well bred andaccomplished gentleman and for that very reason sir is the betterqualified to carry on his profession with impunity he whom youdignify with the appellation of a well bred and accomplished gentlemanis all that you have expressed of him with the exception of one wordthat is substitute for gentleman swindler and the character is justlydelineated this fellow of desperate enterprize is one of the numerouspractitioners of knavery who set themselves up for men of propertyand integrity the more easily to defraud the unwary and ignorant out oftheir substance and

the purpose of cheating the poor deluded farmershopkeeper and tradesman in the interior of the country with respectto tradesmen in town the goods they took of them on trust they disposedof to jews and

account of their creditors calling in their debtsand their country notes becoming due they used to make all possibledispatch to dispose of the various articles and evacuate the premisesbefore detection this done they played the same game elsewhere whenproteus like they changed shapes and disguised themselves so asnot to be known and carried on business in another house but in adifferent name the master became the rider the rider the master theclerks descended to footmen and porters the footmen to porters andclerks and so on throughout until they had drained many parts of thetown and country to the ruin of several worthy and honest familieshowever the copartnership is now dissolved the establishment is brokeup and the different individuals of this nefarious gang of depredatorsof

we said before in the exercise of his former propensitiesso difficult it is to eradicate vice from the human mind even thoughin this instance so early implanted lenity in this case would have

absolute existence naythis sketch might serve for many other places of confinement the fleetc they are like the streets of the metropolis constantly varying intheir company according to entrances and exits of their visitorsthis however continued the hon tom dashall is rather a mentalpicture of what we shall presently witness in reality a sort ofintroductory sketch by way of passport through the doors of thispanorama of real life to which you will shortly be introduced a sortof ideal or dramatic sketch of its inhabitants en masse before thedrawing up of the curtainthe eagerness of bob to listen to his cousin's sketches of londonsociety on the one hand and the earnestness with which dashallhad been exercising his imaginary powers on the other had led ourperambulators to the foot of blackfriar's bridge on their roadto the king's bench without any particular circumstance exciting theirattention when bob suddenly twitching his cousin by the arm anddirecting his eye at the same time to a thin spare figure of a manwithout hat or coat who was rapidly passing towards fleet marketenquired who it was and what was his occupation or callingdon't you hear his calling was the replyhot hot hot pudding hot was in a moment vociferated in his earswhile the active and industrious mercantile pedestrian with a swing ofhis head which was in continual motion from right to left gave bob awipe in the eye with his tail which by the velocity of the wearer waskept in full play like the pendulum of a clock or the tail of matthewsin his admirable delineation of sir fretful plagiaryzounds cries bob it is true i may hear but i can't pretend to sayi can see who the devil is he there is no looking at him he seems toleave time and space behind him where is hetom laughed heartily while bob rubbed his eyes in vain to obtainanother viewthat said dashall is a sort of commissary a dealer in stores forthe stomach red hot pudding all hot and commonly called the flyingpieman james sharpe eglaud more commonly known in the streets ofthe metropolis by the appellation of the flying pitman mayfairly be held forth as an example of what may be effectedby persevering industry and activity especially in a largeand populous city those qualities joined with a moderateshare of prudence cannot fail to ensure to every man atleast comfort and respectability it not competence andwealth however humble his sphere and however unpromisinghis beginnings he was bred to the sedentary trade of atailor and worked for some years with his relation mrcanterbury of friday street cheapside but love whichworks so many changes and which has ere now transformedblacksmiths into painters and which induced hercules toexchange his club for the distaff caused this knight of thesteel bar to relinquish the shopboard and patch up hisfortune by the pattypan he married his landlady a widowwho resided in turnmill street clerkenwell he had a soulabove buttons and abandoned the making of garments to coverthe outside in order to mould cakes pies and other smallpastry to comfort the internals his active geniushowever could not brook the tedious task of serving hiscustomers behind the counter he therefore took up hiseatables and went abroad in quest of them and we doubt nothe has found this practice which he has continued eversince very profitable the neatness and cleanliness of hisappearance at all times are truly pleasing hail rain orshine he may be seen abroad without coat or hat his hairpowdered his shirt sleeves turned up to his elbows and asteel hanging on his apronstring originally he carried atin case something like a dutch oven in which heconstantly kept a lire but is now generally seen with asmall tray in serving a customer he never touches hispudding with his hands but has a knife for the purpose ofpresenting it to the purchasers and his sale is soextensive that he is obliged to replenish several times inaday and in order to secure a regular and ready supplyhis female partner and himself convey a quantity of puddingto a certain distance and deposit their load at somepublichouse where she takes care to keep it all hotwhile egland scours the neighbourhood in search ofcustomers the first cargo being disposed of he returns formore and by this method he has it always fresh and isnever in want of goodsmany laughable anecdotes are told of this flying pitman andperhaps a day's excursion in following him during hisperegrinations would furnish much of curious and interestingamusement we shall however select one authenticated by hisappearance at marlborough street police office on mondayjuly as most intimately connected with real life inlondon when he preferred a serious charge against a beggarno other than the president of a smoking club in the holyland and others for stealing his mutton pies cutting offhis tail and otherwise disfiguring his person by theevidence of egland it appeared that he was introduced withhis goods for sale to a company chiefly consisting ofstreet beggars in st giles's the chair at that momentbeing filled by a beggar without hands well known in thevicinity of the admiralty as a chalked of the pavement thedignity of the chair was well sustained by this ingeniouscoloured who was smoking a pipe as great as an aldermanover a bason of turtle soup but no sooner did egland makehis appearance than the company seized upon his goods andcrammed them down their throats in spite of the repeatedvociferations of honour honour gentlemen from theassailed resistance was vain and egland in this dilemmabegan to consider that his only safety lay in flight thishowever he found equally impracticable he was detainedand by way of consolation for his loss was called upon forasong his lungs were good and although his spirits werenot much exhilarated by the introductory part of theentertainment he began to tip em a stave but whilst hewas chanting the stormy winds do blow a fellow cut offhis tail this was worse than all the rest it was as itwere a part of his working tools and the loss of it waslikely to injure his business by an alteration of hisappearance and could not be tacitly submitted tothe magistrates gravely considering this a most seriouscharge of unprovoked attack upon an industrious individualordered the parties to find bail in default of fullysatisfying the inoffensive dealer in pastry which wasaccordingly donein the year scorning to be behindhand in loyalty aswell as activity he became a member of the clerkenwellvolunteers and was placed in the light company in whichcapacity he obtained the character not only of being thecleanest man but the best soldier in the regimentit is said that for amusement or the gratification of awhim he will sometimes walk a distance of fifty or ahundred miles from the metropolis and return the same wayon such occasions he always manages to take some companionor friend out with him but was never known to come back inthe same company for so irresistibly are they alluredforward by his inexhaustible fund of humour andsprightliness of conversation that they seldom think of thedistance till they find themselves too far from home toreturn on footthen said bob he is not like some of the london dealers whoinvite their customers to taste and try before they buy for he scarcelyseems to afford a chance of seeing what he sellsyou did not try him replied tom nor would he have expected you tobe a customer he is a remarkable character well known all over themetropolis particularly noted for his activity in disposing ofhis goods never standing still for a moment but accosting withextraordinary ease and fluency every person who appears likely to be apurchaser always ready with an answer to any question but deliveringit with so much volubility that it is impossible to propose a secondenquiry suiting at the same time his answer to the apparent qualityof the querist though frequently leaving it unfinished in search of acustomer and moving on with so much rapidity that you may almost findhim at the same moment at tower hill billingsgate and spa fields atsmithfield temple bar and piccadilly indeed he may be said to be inall quarters of the town in a space of time incredibly short for a manwho obtains a livelihood by seeking customers as he moves alongzounds cried bob this walking genius this credible incredibleand visible invisible pedestrian dealer in portable eatables has almostblinded mefor by this flying pitmani've nearly lost an eye mancome said tom i've no fear of your eye while you can muster acouplet so let us proceedcrossing black friars bridge and approaching the road bob who hadassuaged the pain of which he had previously been complainingcould not help admiring the extensive range of houses on each side ofthe way terminated by a handsome building in the distancethat building said dashall will be the extent of our journey forvery near to it is the habitation of merrywell where i entertain nodoubt you will find enough for observation of a useful as well asahumorous nature for an epitome of men and manners is there to beobtainedhere are abundance of subjects worthy of inspection in this quarterreplied tom and we therefore ought not to exhaust too much time onone so let us proceed do you see that high wall to the right that isthe magdalen hospitality established for the relief and the magdalen hospital in blacksmiths road enclosed frompublic view occupies an extensive space of ground and isfrom the nature of its inhabitants very properly soenclosed it was opened in the year and it must be adelightful reflection to its governors that during theperiod it has subsisted more than twothirds of the womenwho have been admitted have been reconciled to theirfriends or placed in honest employments or reputableservices besides which a very considerable portion havesince been married and are at this moment respectablemembers of society circumstances which prove the great andimportant utility of this admirable institutionthere is no prescribed time for the objects of this charityto remain in the house it being varied according tocircumstances every effort is made use of to find out theirrelations and friends if possible to bring about areconciliation with them and if they prove to be persons ofcharacter to put them under their protection if howeverthe young women are destitute of such friends they are keptin the house till an opportunity offers of placing them inreputable services or otherwise procuring them the means ofobtaining an honest livelihood and they never discharge anyonewithout providing for her there have been but fewdischarged beyond the age of twenty yearsthe general business of the establishment is conducted by acommittee consisting of governors who meet at thehospital every thursday at twelve o'clock precisely excepton the first thursday of every mouth when they meet ateleven two of them attend at the chapel in rotation everysunday at morning and evening service when a collection ismade at the door on entrance the hours of divine serviceare a quarter after eleven in the forenoon and a quarterafter six in the evening and on account of the fascinationof the singing no place of worship in the metropolis ismore worthy of the notice of strangersan opportunity is afforded to companies who wish to visitthis charity by addressing a request by letter to thecommittee any thursday or to a bonnet esq the treasurerany day in the week and no fees are allowed to be takenreformation of wretched outcasts from society the principle on whichit is founded entitles it to the countenance and support of the publicand particularly of the female sex the object being to reclaim andrestore to virtue such wanderers in the labyrinths of vice as are nottotally depravedadmirable intentions indeed cried tallyhoho if they are but as wellcarried into effectthe records of the establishment have proved its advantages to societyor rather i should say to its conductors for they are of a naturewhich cannot be publicly exposed without much private injury tothe individuals who partake of them it is however not a littleremarkable that till lately on the very opposite side of the road theneighbourhood has exhibited scenes of vice immorality and indecencywhich it is the great object of this charity if possible to prevent byan endeavour to reclaim the miserable and deluded wretches from theirevil ways i remember the late john home tooke related in the house ofcommons a curious anecdote in allusion to himself and his situationat the time in which this institution was mentioned and which excitedconsiderable interestit is well known that the late john home tooke of political memory asthe reputed tutor of a certain patriotic baronet of the present day aswell as the author of the diversions of parley and a correspondentof the yet undiscovered junius was a reverend divine of the churchof england and when he became a member of parliament it was objectedagainst him that no person in holy orders could hold a seat in thehonourable house of commons in his reply he very ingeniously observedthat this objection reminded him of an applicant for admission to themagdalen who upon being exhorted by the chaplain to forsake herevil ways replied that she was not aware of his meaning and uponexplanation she was excluded from the charity because she was not badenough to require reforming this said mr home tooke is exactlymy case because i am in holy orders i must leave the house andafter committing some act of impropriety to lose my gown i may yet beeligible for a member of this assemblypointed enough said bob tallyhohoyes replied tom and having mentioned the name of the man you mayperhaps recollect the order of the day as well as the curiousdefinition before the commissioners of the income tax as to how a manlives who has no income at all being interrogated by the commissionersas to how he obtained his living mr home tooke replied asfollows why it appears to me gentlemen that there are three modesby which a person may obtain a living the first is by begging nowthis i am too proud to submit to the second by stealing this i don'tchoose to resort to and the third is by the exercise of the wits andthis gentlemen i presume you know nothing abouthere said dashall is the surrey theatre formerly denominated theroyal circus i shall however dispatch my description of it in a veryfew words as we will ere long pay a visit to its interior it is aneat building and shews a good front to the road is fitted up with aconsiderable degree of elegance and is a very convenient theatre itwas originally conducted by hughes and jones and its exhibitions wereboth scenic and equestrian something in the style of what ashley'samphitheatre is now but you must see the one in order to form an ideaof the other horses are now banished at this place where underan annual license from the magistrates of the county burlettasmelodramas dancing and pantomimes are got up and performed in a stylewhich would not disgrace even the patent theatres it is at presentunder the management of mr dibdin a son of the celebrated writer ofso many of our national patriotic and characteristic ballads justthrough the turnpike the building which gives a sort of finish to theroad is the school for the indigent blind at the back of which is thephilanthropic institution calculated to unite the purposes of charitywith those of industry and police to rescue from destruction theoffspring of the vicious and criminal and bethlehem hospital for thecare and cure of insane persons well deserving of minute inspectionand to the right at the corner of a road which leads from westminsterbridge towards vauxhall is an asylum for female orphans which as themagdalen was intended to reclaim prostitutes was originally intended toprevent prostitution to the left again is the king's bench and asthat is our present place of destination we will forego any furtherdescription till another opportunityi cannot however refrain a few remarks on the situation we arenow in for from this place may be seen the children of penance themagdalen the children of darkness the school for the indigent blindthe insane new bethlehem the infatuated and fanatic the congregationsof the soar chapel and the faithful of menses garrets and woodentabernacles the children of thespis and terpsichore the surreytheatre mingled together as it were with the debtor and the captivethe king's bench at least placing ourselves at this obelisk in thecentre of the road the mind's eye can comprehend them within a shortdistance of each otherand a curious admixture of the useful and the sweet it certainly isexclaimed tallyhoho anxious to give his cousin a little respite whilethey turned to the left on their way to the benchyou will find continued tom all the beforementioned infirmitiesblindness infatuation madness and profligacy within the walls thatwe shall shortly enter without the repentant spirit of the sisterswithin the walls we have just passed you will also find there isa plenty of selfinterest and hypocrisy combined with them nay anhospital of incurables is only wanting to complete the scene it is nottill lately that a little reform has been effected in this quarter fordover street and its vicinity as i before observed so near to thesebenevolent charities and to the walls of a prison have been the sinkof female profligacy of the lowest most dangerous and most disgustingkind and suffered too long to pollute the streams of charity and impedethe road to reform however at length the nuisance is removed at leastthe public appearance of it though the neighbourhood is not altogetherbereft of its private negociations and stolen accommodations but comenow for an interior view of the abbott's park its interesting sceneryand its multivarious characters there you shall see what you shallsee and merrywell will tell you more in ten minutes than you might wishto know in your whole life i mean practically though it is well toknow in theory what ought never to be reduced to experimentchapter ivgive me leave to ask a questionpray in the king's bench have you ever beenthe bench good heaven how shocking a suggestionwas e'er so saucy a companion seenwell you ne'er saw the place or if you didtwere better not too closely to surmiseenough enough those frowns the thought forbidwho sees too much is rarely counted wisei rather boast that mine are prudent eyespersons and things so quietly they readnor by a glance confess they scrutinizethat thoughtless lookers think me blind indeedwhen of themselves i take the strictest heedbut since you wish me to believe that collegene'er gave its finish to your educationi of its laws and customs having knowledgeere i take up the thread of my narrationmust say a little for your informationthey had now passed the outer gates of the prison and entered a courtyardsurrounded by a wall which enclosed some good looking housesthese houses said dashall are occupied by the principal officers ofthe place and devoted to purposes of business or let out by them forthe accommodation of those who have purchased the privilege of therules this door directly opposite the gate is the only entrance to theparkillustration paget king's benchthey next passed up the steps and entered a gloomy apartment whereaftera few minutes a turnkey surveying their persons rather minutelyopened the ponderous door which admitted them to an inner court ofconfined dimensions bob looked around him with surprise after thedescription of his cousin and began to think he had been vamping upimaginary pictures of what was not to be realized however hearinga variety of voices and perceiving another gate he quelled hisconjectures and followed dashall who upon knocking at the doorwas surveyed from a sort of loophole by the keeper within who quicklygave them entrance and the spacious appearance of the parade racquetground and habitations and a moving panorama of personages of bothsexes attracted his immediate attentiongazing with enquiring eyes upon this worldwithinwalls theyscarcely heeded the variety of salutations with which they were greetedon entering such as nods winks and touches on the shoulder from onewho appeared as unconscious of such familiarity as if he had for sometimebeen wholly absorbed in the solution of a mathematical problemor the horselaugh of the ignorant and vulgar by whom they foundthemselves surrounded struggling through the throng dashall impelledhis cousin forward repeating as he proceededhow many o'er this threshold pass that mournwanting our power at pleasure to returna moment let us pause ere we ascendthe gallery that leads us to our friendsurvey the place where all that meets your viewis full of interest and strangely newcould we but hide those grinning spikes awhileborne spacious barrack we might think the pilehowever continued he i perceive we are quizzed we will just takea turn round and probably we may meet merrywell if not we will soonfind him out by enquiry you perceive they have the accommodation ofa butcher's shop and a baker's besides green stalls fish stallsand chandlers shops which give the place the appearance of a publicmarket while the racquet players and others amusing themselves invarious ways resemble that of a fairindeed said tallyhoho your description is just for i have as yetseen but few sorrowful faces every one seems to have some object inview either of business or pleasure almost as attractive as thosewithout the walls and in many instances continued dashall of as much nay moreinterest however you perceive the the walls of the king's bench are about thirty feet highsurmounted by a chevaux de frieze and as a place ofconfinement it is of great though uncertain antiquityaccommodation of the inmates has been studied by the founders of thecollege water is well supplied from four pumps and were it not thatthe walls intercept the views a man here might almost consider himselfin his own habitation with only one drawbackand what is that enquired tallyhohomerely that like the starling he can't get outhow now said merry well who had espied the entrance of his friendsfrom the window of his apartment and immediately descended to greetthem touching the honourable tom dashall on the shoulder while heseized bob by the opposite armwhat are you after exploring the secrets of the prisonhousemutual congratulations having passed merrywell welcomed them tohis habitation significantly informing them at the same time thatnotwithstanding his powers of entertainment were just then not what hecould wish all was right the trick was done that he was arrangingfor a house in the rules pro tempore and that it would not be longbefore he should have the honour of meeting them in a way that would bemore agreeable to all parties however continued he if you can beara confined apartment i promise you shall have nothing else to complainof can you put up with potluck in a prisoncertainly was the reply our object was to spend a convivial hourwith you to wile away a little of the time to see and learn to takea peep at things as they are and to form our judgments upon theirexistencethen replied merrywell you have arrived en bon heure for in thisplace a volume of information may be obtained which if judiciouslyapplied must prove beneficial and while dinner is preparing i canafford you abundance of amusement so come along we must move roundthis way to the gate again in order to take any thing like an accuratesurvey and i can furnish some anecdotes of the paraders the playersthe officers of the court and the visitors which cannot fail to proveinteresting this however must be done with caution for suspicion isever active and jealousy constantly awake within these walls and asi mean to give you sketches of individual characters rather than ageneral view of the society with which i am now in association alittle discretion may be well made use ofnow let us analyse but not too loudif wise the composition of this crowdmade up from native soil and foreign

thrownof pugilists of haberdashers jugglershorse jockeys swindlers bond street beaux and smugglersby hollow friendship some in prison thrownby others follies some more by their ownby this time they had traversed round the open walk of the prison andon arriving at the place of entrancedo you observe that small building on the right it is called the statehouse and contains the largest and most convenient rooms it is usuallydevoted to the accommodation of such as are best enabled to pay andthere are persons residing here who live as well and in as dashinga style as those without the walls or at least pay as much for theirliving on the left hand you may also perceive the chapel for thespiritual wants of those confined are not to be forgottenthere in the centre is the chapel doorwith ever changing notices spread o'erwhatever doctrines may within be taughtwith words of peace that door is rarely fraughtfor there mid notices of beds for hireof concerts in the statehouse by desiresome

clumsy pasquinades provoke to warby this time they had reached the door of the chapel which by thevarious placards pasted against it fully confirmed the description ofmerrywellbob casting his eyes around him discovered much for enquiry who arethose in the corner in close conversation togetherthe farthest from us replied merrywell is a jew attorney wellacquainted with all the shuffling arts of the place one who canexplain the whole game from raising the wind down to the whitewashingact for the knowledge and experience of gentlemen or not soas to obtain liberation by the whitewashing act no one at present cantell and melville is taking his walks he is one of the janitors andcrier of the place he has a stentorian voice which is a part of hisbusiness to exercise in calling the prisoners i know but little of himand even that is not worth knowing he however has the character ofbeing an informer and i am not aware that he is in possession of anygood qualities i shall therefore rather give a slight sketch of theoffice he holds than of the personwhoe'er one night has slept within these wallshas heard the din that each new comer callsto where the keeneyed turnkeys wait to tracethe

gentlementhis is the custom with every new comer and is productive sometimes ofmuch mirth to some but of infinite mortification to others accordingto the circumstances of the case as it would occupy

that hour might he pass byunnoted by that wellobserving eyewell said tallyhoho i must confess such scrutiny on the one part andsuch observations on the other would be more than likely to ruffle mytemper and i should be apt to signify my disapprobation at least ofall that was unnecessaryin that case replied merry well you would only subject yourselfto additional torment you would have songs epigrams lampoons andepitaphs in abundance which would prove still more irritating for thisis the seat of learning and of wit of poets painters and musicianswho being enraptured with their own arts neglect that of bookkeepingtill a residence here gives them a leisure opportunity to close theirledgers speaking on that subject by the by we have among us at thismoment the publishers of the john bull whose combined efforts in theway of scurrility have rendered them notorious among the periodicalsof present times there is however little of public attraction aboutthem and although they profess to have a subscription opened to enablethem to pay the fine imposed upon them it is doubted whether anysuch is really in existence here however is a character of anotherdescriptioncaptain k is still a

was the reply for services done or promised to be doneor upon the security of some friend who perhaps intends soon after topay his engagements by a similar mode to that of the person whose debthe pretends to secure no place can be found where the study of ways andmeans is more closely attended to than this of our prisons in generalmuch the same may be said as of our gaming houses very few get out ofthem as they went in a dupe is the general character of those whofirst enter but they seldom fail to acquire that of knave before theirdeparture the air is infectious the society fatal to morality andto honesty few pass through the ordeal with purity and returnuncontaminated to the world and yet after all the frauds tricks andspeculations practised it is well to be acquainted with them in orderto guard against the recurrence if a man can but have fortitude enoughto avoid practising them himselfthink not that the action of the placeis all revealed upon this open spacethe darkest

there is scarcely anypossibility of arriving at any conclusion bless me there is dickbakewelldo you know him said merry wellwhat the devil are you doing here cried a young man advancing and atthe same time catching the honourable tom dashall by the hand areyou initiated or merely come to take a peep at the curiosities of thismenagerie have you tipp'd and shewn yourself in due form or do youstill sport a game leg among the gallants of bond streetfortunately said dashall i can still boast of the latter and haveno very strong inclination to aspire to all the honour and happiness ofthe formergrown serious and sedate i suppose married and cant come prettywife lots of children love and fireside comfort at home pleasureabroad cash in hand and care for nobody that's the sort give you joywith all my heart never were such timesi am glad you find them so continued tom but your anticipationsare a little too rapid and your imagination rather too vivid for myproceeding however there is no knowing what we may come to life is alabyrinth full of turnings and windings but what brought you heredriven in by the philistines was the reply caught like a harmlessdove by the greeks clean'd out by the cog i was obliged to fly tothis pigeon house in order to avoid being cut up by my creditors andup to a little of the newmarket logic i am now crossing and rustlingthough it is doubtful at present who will win the raceyou have not far to run however replied dashall and it istherefore fair to presume the heat will soon be over as usual cried rakewell always something short but pungentlike a pinch of merrygoup satire and sentiment mirth moralityand good humour unmarried and still the same man these are bettersubjects of congratulation than the formerwe shall dine at half

more pluck than a dunghill chick i must stir himup with a long pole give him a lesson or two touch him to the quickand then quickly adjourn to you so adieu for the presentthus saying he made his escape from his friends and passing throughone of the entrances to the interior was quickly out of sightthat said dashall addressing his cousin was one of the gayest ofthe gay in all the leading circles of haut ton and i assure you said merrywell he has not lost one atom of hisvivacity notwithstanding the alteration in his circumstances he isalways full of humour ready for a bit of fun even in confinement heplays laughs sings drinks and is about one of the most cheerfulcompanions i know merrygoup snuff bellows a cant term for the lungs breadbasket the stomach the dibs are in tune there

public kitchen wherefora trifling fee cooking is performed for the prisoners and hotwater supplied at a penny per kettle then there is a coffeeroom anda taproom for general accommodation according to the circumstances ofthe inmates so that in point of fact there is little to be regrettedhere but the loss of liberty and the want of moneyzounds said bob those two articles constitute all that is valuablein life and in their absence it dwindles into mere existenceand bare existence man to live ordainedwrings and oppresses with enormous weighti admit the justice of the remark for to become an article ofvegetation were it sure of continuance would be one of the mostirksome as well as degrading situations to which a man could bereduced but you should recollect that the generality of persons whostudy in this college expect an early termination of their privationsby which hope is kept alive and when the cherished hope is realized ofescaping from these walls all recollection of the past is banishedand it is doubtful whether the temporary absence from the possibilityof indulging in folly does not increase the possibility as well as thepower when at libertywho do you call that man with his hands in his pockets pointing to aperson at a short distance from them at the moment in slovenly attireand with a vacant countenancehush replied merry well for we have modest men here as well aselsewhere men who though they have rendered themselves famous a moredelicate term than notorious are not emulous of having their deedsrecorded in history and are indeed very tenacious of satisfyingenquiries his name is f rr ter not quite so vacant as he looks forit is generally speaking not your emptyheaded fellows who can arriveat the honour of a residence here it is rather those of brilliantimagination of aspiring talent who have been determined to have moneyfor a time without heeding the source from which it was derived whohave been up to snuff till they have reduced themselves to thenecessity of resting contented with the marrowbone stage instead of aphaeton or a curricle and twopenny in lieu of claret theperson you allude to however is brother to cecil f rr ter of courtnotoriety and has really been in possession of considerable propertyit is said that his principal failing has been too strong an inclinationto resort to the law and that upon the law and lawyers he has expendedthe bulk of his fortunehe cuts a curious figure now however said tallyhoho and every viewat first sight would take him for a fortunate youthdo you observe that man in mustachios now talking with p s thatis captain r n who bears a more striking resemblance in character tothe celebrated youth you mention he had at one time inspired a beliefamong those who knew him that he was a man of property married with aview to realize it and upon comparing notes after the nuptial knotwas tied both parties discovered they were taken in but it is notascertained whether this mutual disappointment ended with smileswhy it was no laughing matter said tom the lucky hit was all amissyes there was a miss taken and a biter bit love is a lottery as wellas life and the chances two to one against the adventurer replieddashallit may be so said merrywell i am not fly to the subjectat present perhaps sparkle could by this time unravel some of itsmysteries and give beneficial lessons to us all however time isflying we will just make one more turn and then to dinner with whatappetite we may do you observe the pericranium topp'd with a prussiancap and the wearer with a pipe in his mouth fit to be up to any thing to understand to know or beawakei was on the point of enquiry said bob pray who is hethat is another captainwho one would almost think you have the whole army of martyrs confinedhere said tallyhoho at all events your ranks are not deficient ofofficersbut then said dashall they are out of commission and out ofpracticefor want of command continued merrywell though capt s although never made a commander in chief has been an exalted characterhaving once been made inspector of the pavement or in otherwords snapped the stoop and if report says true he has also figuredaway in other situations equally honourable a flash turf man a navalcharacter and a smuggler but come i have given you a sort of index bywhich you may read mark and learn more when we are more at leisureit is now half past three o'clock and punctuality is always my motto inspector of the pavement or snapped the stoop cant termfor the pilloryhumph ejaculated tom cash down and no grumblingd n severity was the reply no more of that or we cut touch myhonour and you touch my lifedot and go one cried dashall come along bob and catching hiscousin by the arm they followed merrywell in silence to his apartmentin the state houseon arrival they found the dinner on table and bakewell true to hisappointment arrived before them the keen air of surrey thoughrather confined had furnished them with good appetites apologieswere banished and to it they went without let hinderance ormolestation the viands were good the wines exquisite and plentifulthe cloth being removed mirth and conviviality were the order of thedayconfusion to soft heads and hard hearts parks and pleasure ground swithout priories were drank in bumpers with enthusiastic applause themerriment and hilarity of merrywell and his fellow student crowned theafternoon with as much pleasure and delight as bob conceived hecould have found under unlimited circumstances the good humour andhospitality of the host was manifested in the perfect satisfaction ofthose he entertained and about eight o'clock when rakewell began tomangle his mother tongue our friends after dropping their mitesinto the canisters held out for their bounty repassed the gates wellpleased and highly diverted with the information they had obtainedand the occurrences of the day and not a little exhilarated by thebacchanalian juicewell said tallyhoho this is a scene of real life which i shouldjudge could scarcely be equalled and would almost induce one to wishfor an opportunity of a residence along with the collegians provided always nevertheless with an equal opportunity of leavingit when we please said dashall and probably we have only seen oneof the best pictures it contains for although we have been as jolly assandboys there is a large store of misery unseen but let us proceedwe shall soon be free from college rules and a thought strikes me thatwe can make a call on our road that will afford another view of societyequally amusing and refreshing i have often observed to you that inorder to see life there is no necessity to bus about with court fliesto waste time and money in getting introduced to the tip tops of thewest to join what are termed the fashionable circles and to end afashionable career by a whereas or a whitewashing the true student ofreal life should occasionally mingle with all descriptions of personsmark the characters and their conduct and believe me there are thosein the humblest situations who enjoy themselves in their own way withas much of heartfelt satisfaction as those in the highest of whichi think i shall be able to give you a decided proof before we reachhomethey now pursued their way along the london road and over westminsterbridge till tom called a halt at the door of a friendcome bob said he here we must unease doff the present toggeryand turn out in new trim for the eveningwhat enquired bob another masqueradeno no was the reply a temporary suspension of the dress andcharacter of a gentleman in order to avoid being tormented andsuspected by the company to which i intend to introduce youfinding his friend at home they were quickly supplied with tatter'dgarments and slouched hats in which they again sallied forth and aboutnine o'clock they entered a low publichouse in scotlandyardillustration pages public housefear nothing said tom as they passed the threshold don't beflurried by any thing said to you tis only a heavywet party among thecoalheaving covesas bob entered the room his very first action betrayed him for beingaccustomed to genteel behaviour he took off his hat which was in amoment knocked out of his hand by a hard featured fellow near him whoseface indicated the want of water although so near the river order order was vociferated in an instant by a jollygoodnatured looking man exalted above the rest who at thesame moment rapped the table with his knuckles this here waygentlemen bill muggins mind you i ain't had your penny in the platefor backvy that's a lie roar'd out a stentorian voice i never takes myseat before i sees my way clear upon the board i put a crooked ha'pennyyes and two bad gardens what an't worth nothing said another makehim tip cried a third or else stick him in the nitch stick him in the pitch send him to coventrybob having regained his castor followed his cousin to the other endof the room and after each depositing a penny in the plate they tooktheir seats at the table where being supplied with a flowing quartthey began to look around themthe first thing which struck tallyhoho's eye was no trust printed inlargeletters at one end of the room a sort of indication that a manwithout money would not be likely to meet with agreeable entertainmentthen turning his head the other way he discovered they were in ahouse of call for coal porters before the president who by way ofdistinction had turned the broad flap of his coalheaving hat forwardin the fashion of a huntsman's cap was placed a small round table onwhich stood a gallon measure of heavy wet on his right sat a wornoutworkman fast asleep and occasionally affording his friends around him asnoring accompaniment to a roar of laughtersilence

call on now billvy bob martlet's the boy to come it strongbob martlet was accordingly called upon but requested a few minutes toprepare himself as he was rather hoarseduring this interregnum dashall slipped out of the room and gave thelandlord an order to place two bowls of punch on the tables cautioninghim at the same time to say nothing of the party who paid for it butto say that a gentleman passing by the door and hearing them all merryhad given an order for it at the bar upon reentering the room bob martlet with one eye bound up andhis hat in his hand was bawling with lungs of leatherlovely nymph assuage my anguishat thy feet a tender swainprays you will not let him languishone kind look would ease his paindid you know the lad who courts youhe not long need sue in vainprince of song and dance youscarce will meet his like againas this was a song to be sung in character bob martlet determined toprofit by the instructions of shakspeare to suit the action to theword and the word to the action and consequently at the word dancehe introduced some steps to the great entertainment of the companybut unfortunately jigging to another tune in which all the broad brimsjoined he forgot the connexion of the words and was compelled to singit over again and to give his hornpipe by way of conclusion which wasaccompanied by the barking of a dogtallyhoho laughed heartily at this the grotesque appearance of thetender swain and the dance in wooden shoes were admirable andhighly relished by his companions the room resounded with applauseand it was some moments before silence could be obtained when lo andbehold the landlord entered the room as a peacebreaker with two bowlsof punchconsternation and surprise were visible in every countenance theconfusion of tongues could scarcely equal the enquiries made in amoment but the landlord having his cue made no reply but thereit is will you drink it it is all your own and to set you a goodexample here goes success to trade and took a hearty swig from thebowl he placed before the president then taking the other bowl to thelower end of the room he evaporated but soon returned withglasses where he came from or how it was obtained was banished fromconsideration and to make more the remnant of a pot of heavy wet wasthrown into the bowl to mellow it as the president observed becausevy he liked things mellow the punch was handed about the song and thetoast passed merrily in succession till near twelve when an unluckydisturber of harmony with a candle set fire to the whisker of hillthe flue maker so called from his having in his younger days beena chimneysweeper hill who had slept during the noise of the eveningwas notwithstanding his former trade not fireproof awoke in a flameand not knowing the real depredator upset the president and nearlyknock'd him through a window just behind him milled away in alldirections growling with as much melody as he had before snored duringthe confusion of this affray tom and bob took their departure fromcharley's crib which they understood was a nickname given to the placeand throwing themselves into a rattler soon arrived in piccadillywhere we shall for the present leave them to their reposechapter vsince life's but a jest let us follow the rulethere's nothing so pleasant as playing the foolin town we may practise as well as at schoolthe world turns about the same things o'er and o'erwe fool it our forefathers fool'd it beforethey did what we do which our sons will encorelife's but a half holiday lent us to starewe wander and wonder in vanity's fairall babylike bawling for each bawble therewe children like covet the glitter of gay thingsmake racket for ribbands and such sort of playthingswhich we cannot have tho without we can say thingswe take or are in all our turns taken inthe world to be sure tis a shame and a sinmight soon be much better but who will begin london said the hon tom dashall to his cousin abounds withso much of munificence that notwithstanding all its intricacies andinconveniences he who travels through life without visiting it mayjustly be said to know nothing for it is all life its remotest cornersare full of animation and although it is difficult to fancy how alllive there are few but could give some satisfactory information if theychose though i am willing to believe many would rather wish to avoidinterrogation we have already explored some parts of it but be assuredthere is still much to admire much to applaud and much to deprecateour researches after all have been rather confined than extensive itis such an ever varying and never ceasing mine of observation that itis almost like the wishing cap of fortunatus with this exception thatalthough every wish may be supplied it requires something more thanputting on the cap to obtain the object desired from what i have already seen replied tallyhoho i perfectlycoincide with you in the latter part of your observation for i have nodoubt but perseverance and integrity with some portion of ability issure to meet rewardyou are right continued tom many instances could be pointed outin proof of the justice of that remark some of the greatest men of thepresent day have rose from the lowest origin shopboys and porters havebecome tradesmen and merchants shoeblacks have become statesmen andservants councillors but on the other hand many who have been born asthe old saying is with a silver spoon in their mouths have fallenfrom their high estates and lingered out the latter parts of theirlives in prisons or workhouses laying the blame on fate rather thanattributing failure to their own want of ability prudence or activeexertion but come i perceive the curricle is ready let us takea spank through the city and look a little more minutely at themercantile worldthis call was instantly obeyed by tallyhoho who never doubted buthis cousin had some object in view though he frequently started frompiccadilly without being previously acquainted with itpassing out at hyde park corner bon remarked that he thought the citylay the other waynever mind replied dashall we shall come to the point withoutdoubt why man there are more ways than one and i am not particularlypartial to being blocked up in the public streets amidst knowingsurveys and cramp carmen sugar hogsheads molasses and slush cartswhich is so frequently the case when by a slight deviation from thedirect way we can give the tits a rattler on a good road withoutobstruction and pocket a handful of time into the bargainhe now turned into the road which leads directly to vauxhall bridge onarriving at which tallyhoho was much delighted with an extensive view ofthe thamesthis said dashall will bring us to a favourite place of amusementwhere you have already cut a conspicuous figurewhat do you mean enquired his cousina masquerade replied he significantly go along bob passing gently over the bridge do you observe continued hethat extensive building that is called the penitentiary it is abuilding designed for the punishment employment and reformation ofoffenders of secondary turpitude usually punished by transportationfor a term of years it has been conceived since the commencement of thedisputes which terminated in the separation of the american statesthe plan of it is known to be partly that of mr jeremy bentham theculprits are confined in circular buildings the windows of which are soconstructed that the overseer from his room in the centre may be ableto view every one of their rooms the external wall encloses no lessthan eighteen acres of ground within which are six of these circularbuildings each capable of lodging and employing from to prisoners with a chapel infirmary and other conveniences itssituation is called millbankit looks said bob like a castle or tower of impregnablestrengthit is however continued tom a useful institution since itsupersedes that indiscriminate transportation so long practised andwhich as applied to definite periods was cruel and unjust since thewretched objects were precluded from the power of ever returningto their native land however short the intended period of theirbanishment this part of the world is much improved of late years thebridge we are now passing is an admirable light and elegant structurebut recently erected according to the plan of mr j walker andconnects as you perceive by a straight line of road with hyde parkcorner the road before us leads to lexington cross and thence byvarious ways to the city the bridge consists of nine arches of equalspan in squares of cast iron on piers of rusticated stone formed offragments united by means of parker's cement its width is feetthe span of the arches feet the height feet and the clearbreadth of the road way is feet it cost above l but weshall shortly cross another bridge far surpassing it in point ofmagnificenceit is wonderful indeed said bob that in a country complaining ofa starving population such serious sums of money should be expended inthe erection of splendid mansions and magnificent bridges not at all was the reply for perhaps it is one of thebest ways of expending as it gives employment to thousands who wouldotherwise have become beggars on private charity or paupers on publicbounty either of which is revolting to the mind of an englishmanbesides if your observation applied at all it would cut at everyimprovement of the day and you should recollect that whether upontrue foundations or not every generation think the age they live in isthe most enlightened so it may be with respect to the preceding andindeed so much so that the succeeding will rather decline than improveupon it but it would be difficult to convince them of the fact it iscertain however that scarcely a day passes but some new invention orimprovement is offered to public notice the perusal of the newspapersis an evidence of my assertion and as london is the centre ofattraction so it is the seat of knowledge of science and informationi should judge that if a person who had lived some two hundred yearsago even in this wild place were to rise up amongst us his surpriseand astonishment would be strongly excited said bob endeavouring todraw forth more of his observations as they bowled along the roadthere can be no question on that subject said tom for how would thehigh ideas he entertained of the ingenuity of the age in which he hadlived dwindle into nothing nay should he appear in the countryfirst what would he think of the various implements of husbandry forploughing and preparing the land the different machines for sowingthe corn for threshing grinding and dressing it and in numerousinstances though perhaps not quite so much now as it has been onaccount of the present agricultural distresses he would find somethingelse too which he might not consider an improvement instead of meetingthe honest homely farmer assisting personally in the gathering in hiscrops and his daughter following the cart with a rake he would findthe former mounted on his pray following the hounds and the latter atboarding school instead of the farmer's son bringing home his cows ofan evening and his sister going out to meet him at the sound of hiswell known voice with her milkwhite pail he would find the one poringover latin and greek and the other running her fingers over the chordsof a harp or pianoforte these said bob are refinements in manners at leastthen should he take a peep at london as we are now doing he would bestruck dumb with admiration but here we are on the waterloo road thatbuilding on the right is the coburg theatre so named in complimentto the prince of saxe coburg who married the unfortunate princesscharlotte of wales the much regretted daughter of our present kingbefore us is waterloo bridge which leads to the strand and wasoriginally denominated the strand bridge it is acknowledged to beone of the most majestic structures of the kind perhaps in the knownworld and was built under the direction of the late mr jennie towhose memory it is said a monument is intended to be erected the bridgeconsists of nine equal arches and like the bridges of the ancientsis perfectly flat which you perceive the road we are now travelling isnot for in some instances you may look over the wall upon another worldbelow as we are above the tops of the houses its being level is acircumstance highly favourable to the draught of carriages across itand without any apparent subtraction from its beauty we will alighthere and walk leisurely across taking time for remarkthe servants now took charge of the curricle with orders to wait at thecorner of the strand while our heroes having each deposited his pennyat the tollhouse strolled forwardtallyhoho appeared delighted with the views around him in the front afine prospect of one of the finest cities in the world and behind anequally pleasing sight over the surrey hills the day being fineand the sun darting his refulgent beams on the bosom of the thamescontributed to form altogether one of the most enraptured sights hehad ever beheld the passing and repassing of boats and bargesbelow and carriages horsemen and pedestrians crossing the bridgealternately attracted his attentioneach arch of this bridge said dashall is feet span the piers feet thick with tuscan columns the width between the parapets feet these footpaths are seven feet each and the roadway is feet the cost has been immense and it is not likely that the originalsubscribers will ever realize the capital expended at this moment the sound of music attracted the ears of tallyhohowhat have we here said he thrusting his head through thebalustrades by which he found himself almost suffocated with smokewhich stopped further enquirybehold said tom another improvement of the age that is therichmond steam boat proceeding with a cargo of live stock to thatcelebrated place of public resort and in spite of wind and weatherwill return in the evening they always have a band of music on boardfor the amusement of their passengerszounds said bob they ought to have a smokeconsumerthey had one just now replied tom for i apprehend you assisted themin some degree though not voluntarilyyou are smoking me said bobnever mind you have only been puffing a cloudhowever as the mist is dispelled said tallyhoho and we have a clearsky before us again let us make use of our sensesto the right you perceive blacksmiths bridge and beyond that thesouthwark bridge by the way we were speaking of the alterations to bewitnessed in a country life we will now pursue the subject and supposefor a moment our twothousandyearsago friend after his visit amongthe swains inclined to transfer his observations to the great town thefirst question would be how shall i get there oh there are plenty ofnight coaches and day coaches too sir well then fancy him seated inanight coach and having supped on the road on resuming his cornerof the vehicle he falls into a sound sleep guess what must be hissurprise on waking in the morning to find himself in the bustle andapparent confusion of the streets of the metropolis but how alteredwide streets and upright houses instead of narrow lanes with housesmeeting each other at the tops then what elegant shops he wouldexclaim rubbing his eyes why this is all a dreamproceeding from the heatoppressed brain it cannot be reality however he swallows a hasty breakfastand sallies out again to look about him from london bridge he espiesthe one i have just mentioned the southwark bridge what have wehere oh sir that is the castiron bridge with three archesover the thames he hastens to it and when upon it what must be hisastonishment at the power of the human mind to form and of the humanbody to bring together such immense pieces of iron to connect queenstreet cheapside with the kent and surrey roads by three arches thecentre of which is feet span and the side ones feet each thearches all composed of cast iron the piers and abutments of stonezounds he would exclaim if the race of man dwindle in stature theygrow daily more stupendous in intellect but we will suppose likeyou with an anxiety to see all that can be seen he perceives a machinesailing down the river with astonishing velocity why formerly saidhe wind and tide against a vessel were insurmountable obstacles in itspassage but now they seem to add to its swiftness how is this to beaccounted for easily enough replies a byestander lordbless you it's all done by steam hot water and smoke do every thingnowadays why there are a great number of machines which formerlyrequired from two to forty or more horses each to put and keep inmotion entirely worked by the steam arising from boiling water prodigious steam do all that astonishingand truly replied bob notwithstanding i have witnessed manyimprovements i confess i am astonished at the various uses to whichthis discovery has already been devoted and the extraordinary powers itpossesseswell we will pursue the train of thought a little further supposeperambulating the streets till he is quite tired and seeing alterationsand changes out of number he enters a coffee house eats a hearty mealand taking a glass or two of wine he falls into a musing train of ideasof the wonders he has been witnessing from which he is not disturbedtill the hoarse voice of a charley sounds in his ear past ten o'clockand a cloudy night at which he hastily starts up discharges his billand prepares by buttoning up close and securing his trusty stick foras he would naturally expect a dull dreary walk he sallies out thusequipped and to his utter astonishment finds the streets as busy asin the middle of the day and almost as light he steps up to one of thelights to examine it what can this be it is not oil there isno vessel to contain it surely this can't be steam also but what canit be gas sir says a passenger who overhears the question gasit is produced from coals set on fire and confined in a furnace thesubtle vapour from which is conveyed by means of pipes and lightapplied to it immediately bursts into a flame his astonishment wouldnow be complete and if he did sleep after it would be difficult topersuade him it was not all a dreamour wise forefathers knew the worth of landand banked the thames out with laborious handfrom fresh encroachments bound it's restless

dashall tickled the tits in prime style alongthe strand in the road to the city soon after passing temple bar theywere attracted by a vast concourse of persons surrounding the shop ofmr carlile from whence upon enquiry they learnt the perhaps some of the most remarkable occurrences in thecity of london have taken place at the house of carlisle thewhole family have been tried and convicted of sellingtreasonable or seditious works and are now suffering thesentence of the law but notwithstanding the combinedefforts of a powerful body the shop is kept open and it ismore than likely that a greater business is carried on nowthan ever in a recent number of the republican publishedby him he makes the following observationssince my last went to press we have thought it prudent toresort to stratagem to defeat the schemes of the gang intakingout every new hand from the shop by a warrant wenow sell all publications to suspicious and unsuspiciouscustomers through a hole in a part of the shop where it isimpossible for the purchaser to identify the seller asthere are always two or three serving in the back groundnone of whom can be seen or heard to be identifiedindividually these persons are frequently changed so thateven if the enemy resorted to burglary and housebreakingupon the strength of any warrant the seller of any pamphletor pamphlets could not be identified where the statue ofpaine stood we are about to caricature the defeat of murrayand sharpe and make them watch the hole through which themoney and pamphlets pass without being able to prevent itthere are fifty stratagems by which i could give full effectto the sale of my publications as well as if they weresold openly and which would defy prosecution as the vendercould not be identified i dislike this mode of doingbusiness i like open fair play and i now considerable taste by whichthe interior of the church has been much improved in appearanceafter having examined these stately and expressive mementos ofmortality the two visitors were asked by their attendant whether theywould pass to the stone and iron galleries outside of the church butthis having so lately enjoyed the extensive prospect from the monumentthey declined and proceeded at once to the library the first object tobe seen in the ascentour two visitors were very much pleased with this handsome room whichin its dimensions is about fifty feet by forty having shelves of booksto the top with a gallery the statues of dr johnson and howard the philanthropistboth executed by the late mr bacon were opened for publicinspection in that of dr johnson represents a moralphilosopher with the attitude and expression of intensethought leaning against a column indicative of thefirmness of mind and stability of principles of the man whomit is intended to commemoratethe statue of howard in which the character of activebenevolence is well expressed stands upon a pedestal ofwhite marble on which is a group of basreliefrepresenting a scene in a prison where the philanthropisthaving broken the chains of the prisoners is bringingprovision and clothing for their reliefthe statue of sir william jones a man well known for hisextensive and multifarious erudition whose study it was tomake the british name honoured and revered amongst thenations of the east is also the work of bacon and waserected by the east india companyamongst the monuments lately raised in commemoration of departedworth is that of nelson and in design and executionit is not exceeded by any in the cathedralin the open part of the cathedral the stranger will bestruck with the appearance of numerous tattered flags thetrophies of british valour those over the aisle leadingfrom the western door were taken in part during theamerican war and the rest by the duke of york atvalenciennes those on both sides near the north door werereprisals made from the french by lord howe on the st ofjune opposite to which on the right hand are theflags taken from the

of small square pieces and is not only curious for its being inlaidwithout a nail or a peg to fasten the parts but is very neat in theworkmanship and beautiful in its appearance the principal thingspointed out to a stranger are several carved stone pillars some latinmanuscripts written by monks years ago and an english manuscriptilluminated containing rules for the government of a convent writtenin old english about years since all in fine preservationthe clockwork and the great bell were the next curiosities thatattracted the attention of our visitants on the latter weighinglbs the hammer of the clock strikes the hours it was now noonand the ponderous hammer put itself into motion and slowly yet withastounding impetus struck the bell and the reverberation tingled onthe auricular organs of the two strangers with painful and stunningeffect throughout the long protracted intimation of the hour nor was ituntil a considerable time had elapsed that their hearing recovered fromthe clanging agitation this bell is never tolled but upon the death of some ofthe royal family of the bishop of london or of the dean ofst paul's and then the clapper is moved and not the bellin the stillness of night the indication of the hour by thedeeply sonorous tone of this bell may be heard not merelyover the immense metropolis but in distant parts of thecountry the fact is well known of the sentry at windsorwho when accused of having been asleep one night on hispost denied the charge saying that he had been listeningto st paul's in london which had just struck thirteenand this assertion was upon enquiry satisfactorilycorroboratedthey were now ushered into the whispering gallery which isconstructed on the very simple principle of an unbroken communicationit is yards in

sorts theindiscriminate heterogeneous mass of matter and disposes of it aswell as he can how many hundreds and thousands in a metropolis like thatof the british empire obtain a subsistence in a way ofwhich those of its inhabitants who are not compelled to suchan exercise of their ingenuity can have no idea in themidst of a crowded city man is much more closely cut offfrom all assistance on the part of his fellows and isobliged to trust entirely for the support of life to theindividual exertions of his strength his talents or hisingenuity various and singular are the expedients practisedby numbers in the british capital among these the class ofmudlarks is not the least extraordinary that is peoplewho on the ebb of the tide repair to the riverside inquestof any article that the water may have left behind inthe mud to this description of people belonged peggy jonesthe well known mudlark at black friars she was a womanapparently about forty years of age with red hair theparticular object of whose researches was the coals whichaccidentally fell from the sides of the lighters herconstant resort was the neighbourhood of blacksmiths whereshe was always to be seen even before the tide was downwading into the water nearly up to the middle and scrapingtogether from the bottom the coals which she felt with herfeet numbers of passengers who have passed by that quarterparticularly over blacksmiths bridge have often stopped tocontemplate with astonishment a female engaged in anoccupation apparently so painful and disagreeable sheappeared dressed in very short ragged petticoats

habiliments and her legs encrustedwith mud she traversed the streets of this metropolissometimes she was industrious enough to pick up three andat others even four loads a day and as they consistedentirely of what are termed round coals she was never at aloss for customers whom she charged at the rate of eighteena load in the collection of her sable treasure shewas frequently assisted by the coalheavers who when shehappened to approach the lighters would as ifunfeignedly kick overboard a large coal at the same timebidding her with apparent surliness go about her businesspeggy jones was not exempt from a failing to which mostindividuals of the lower orders are subject namelyinebriety her propensity to liquor was sometimes indulgedto such a degree that she would tumble about the streetswith her load to the no small amusement of mischievousboys and others who on such occasions never failed tocollect around her after concluding the labors of the dayshe retired to a wretched lodging in chick lane this womancarried on her extraordinary calling for many years butabout the month of february she suddenly disappearedfrom her usual places of resort and nobody can tell what isbecome of her a man who has the appearance of a coalheaverhas since stepped into her place and adopted theprofession which she so long followed thus it is that the mudlark earns a precarious and

mrs elizabeth fry andi am desirous of seeing the result of her philanthropic exertions thegentlemanly appearance and demeanour of the two strangers facilitatedtheir admission and they entered the prison preceded by one of theturnkeys who courteously had proffered his services in shewing theplace and giving every required informationnewgate on the eastern side of the old bailey has been rebuilt itswalls or shell excepted since it was destroyed by the rioters in theyear a broad yard divides newgate from the sessions house a veryhandsome stone and brick building another edifice where that latelystood commonly called surgeon's hall has been erected it is archedunderneath and supported upon pillars and is used as a place ofaccommodation for witnesses and other persons while waiting for thetrials during session time this prison until within these few years back was a place ofconfinement as well for debtors as felons but by late arrangementsand the erection of the new gaol in whitecrossstreet newgate has nowbecome the receptacle of felons only newgate has been the scene of two remarkable events whichfrequently serve as eras of reckoning to some of theinhabitants of london the first is that of the memorableriots in when this imposing edifice was attacked by afurious mob in the evening of monday the th of june who bybreaking the windows batterking the entrances of the cellswith sledge hammers and pickaxes and climbing the wallswith ladders found means to enter mr german's housecommunicating with the prison and eventually liberatedthree hundred prisoners the next of these events occursedon the rd of february this was when haggard andholloway were to suffer for the murder of mr steele onhourslow heath the populace began to assemble so early asfive o'clock and to accumulate until eight it is supposedthat the concourse of people was greater than at theexecution of governor wall at eight o'clock the prisonersascended the scaffold immediately after they were launchedoff a most dreadful scene took place the approaches to theplace were completely blocked up with carts filled withspectators and when some of the crowd began to move awaythe pressure became dreadful some fell and others fallingover them they were trampled to death terror tookpossession of the crowd they became desperate and theirefforts only contributed to increase their danger as soonas this frightful confusion ceased fortytwo sufferers inthe scene were carried to st bartholomew's hospital ofthese twentyseven were dead and though every effort wasmade for their resuscitation in not one instance was itcrowned with success of fortytwo the whole number fivewere women and three of them were among the dead of theremaining twentyfour bodies five were men and the restlads from twelve to seventeen years of age among the deadmen was a pyeman who was said to have fallen first andcaused the dreadful catastrophe a great number of thepupils in attendance happened to be collected in stbartholomew's hospital at the time and afforded promptassistance and dr powell and a surgeon who were bothupon the spot directed their humane exertionsin the old bailey stood sydneyhouse known by the white front and therecess in which it is concealed and here jonathan wild is said to havelived the greatest part of his time the north side of newgate consistsof two courtyards which are far too circumscribed for the numerousinhabitants this prison always exhibiting a multitudinous calendar ofhuman depravity the men's court is only feet inches by feet and the women's of the same length and about half the width the wholesquare is entirely surrounded by the wards which rise threestories above the pavement the women's yard is separated from themen's by a wall in the south and southeast yards felons for trial areconfined and four other yards are similarly occupied the yard assignedto female felons is a wretched place containing three wards in whichare sometimes kept upwards of one hundred women in the northeastcorner next newgatestreet is the condemned yard in which arekept persons under sentence of death the yards and all the wards arerepeatedly limewashed and by these and other excellent regulationsof the sheriffs of london newgate is changed from a loathsome prisondangerous to the health of the metropolis to a state which maybequoted as a model for all similar places water is plentifulventilators are introduced into every window and a general system ofcleanliness prevails throughout the whole prison the morals of itsinmates have been improved and their condition greatly melioratedby mrs elizabeth fry who like her predecessor in the exercise ofphilanthropy the celebrated howard delights in reducing the sumof human misery the feelings of the two visitors having beenamply gratified by demonstration of the happy result from superiormanagement accruing to the prisoners they departed not forgettingthe poor box put up for general benefit inviting the contributions ofcharitable strangerscontinuing their route our perambulators proceeded down skinner streetinto lowborn and traversed its extended line without any remarkableoccurrence until they

squire having expressed tohis friend a desire of perambulating these boundaries they proceededby the way of george street to explore the sanctified labyrinths thescenes of diurnal clamour and hebdomadary conflictarrah now exclaimed a voice of maternity in the person of alegitimate daughter of erin arrah now you brat of the devil's ownbegetting be after bowling along to your fader bad luck

hisengagements with some of the irish provincial theatres proceeded toamuse his auditory the baronet excepted with accounts of the manner ofposting in the sister kingdomtravelling said he in the province of munster having got into achaise i was surprised to hear the driver knocking at each side of thecarriage what are you doing an't i nailing your honor why doyou nail me up i don't wish to be nailed up augh would your honorhave the doors fly off the hinges when we came to the end of thestage i begged the man to unfasten the doors ogh what would i betakingout the nails for to be racking the

to thepostillion augh did any one ever see any one get out of a clay headforemost can't your honor put out your feet first like a christianhere the baronet manifested considerable impatience and was aboutto interrupt the narrator when the latter requesting permissioncontinuednext day four horses were attached to the crazy vehicle oneunfortunately lost a shoe and as i refused to go on until thepoor animal was shod my two postillions commenced in my hearing acolloquy paddy where will i get a shoe and no smith nighhand why don't you see yon gentleman's horse in the field can't yougo and unshoe him true for ye said jem but that horse's shoewill never fit him augh you can but try it said paddy so thegentleman's horse was actually unshod and his shoe put upon the postinghack and fit or

paddy of the inconveniencei suffered from the storm pelting in my face his consolation wasaugh god bless your honour and can't you get out and set behind thecarriage and you'll not get a drop at all i'll engagethe player having thus closed his narrative and the laughter of thecompany having subsided the baronet very candidly admitted that thesister kingdom in many parts was miserably deficient in the requisitesof travelling and other conveniences to which the english wereaccustomed but in process of time he continued we shall get morecivilized nevertheless we have still an advantage over you we havemore hospitality and more honesty nay by the powers but it is so mygood friends however much we unhappily may quarrel with each other werespect the stranger who comes to sojourn amongst us and long would hereside even in the province of munster before a dirty spalpeen wouldrob him of his great coat and umbrella and be after doing that samething when he was at a friend's house too from which they were takenalong with nearly all the great coats cloaks shawls pelisses hatsand umbrellas belonging to the company we are inclined to believe that sir felix alludes to thefollowing instance of daring depredationextraordinary robbery on thursday night whilst a large party of youngfolks were assembled at the house of mr gregory in hertford streetfitzroy square to supper a young man was let in by a servant who saidhe had brought a cloak for his young mistress as the night was coldthe servant left him in the hall and went up stairs when shortlyafter a second arrived with a hackney coach and on his beingquestioned by the servant he said he brought the coach to take hismaster and mistress home the servant was not acquainted with the namesof half the company and therefore credited what was told her the twostrangers were suffered to stand at the stairs head to listen to themusic and singing with which they appeared highly delighted andalso had their supper and plenty to drink but while festive hilarityprevailed above the villains began to exercise their calling below andthe supper table in a trice they unloaded of four silver table spoonsa silver sauceboat knives and forks c and from off the pegs andbanisters they stole eight topcoats several cloaks shawls pelissesand hats besides a number of umbrellas muffs tippets and otherarticles all of which they carried off in the coach which was inwaiting to complete the farce the watchman shut the coach door andwished their honours good night the robbery was not discovered untilthe company was breaking up no trace of the thieves can be found there was certainly somewhat of an irishism in the baronet'sremark of eight great coats stolen the thieves could not discriminatewho were the respective owners and if it had been possible that theycould have discriminated it is not likely that any regard for the lawsof hospitality would have induced them to make an exception of sir felixo'o'grady's property amidst the general depredationthe company although secretly amused by the baronet's remarks condoledwith him on the loss he had sustained and the player protesting thatin stating the facts of irish posting he had no intention of giving thebaronet the least offence unanimity was restored and the convivialityof the evening proceeded without further interruptionsir felix made irish bulls anding to the jolly deity of the ancients in frequent and powerfullibationsby some unaccountable means the daemon of discord however gainedadmission and ascendancya scene now took place which baffles every attempt at description

in the piazzas where they waited the result of theconflictnegotiations of peace having been unavailingly attempted the refractorycombatants were taken into custody after an obstinate resistance

intimation of the proceedings announcedthe hour of past three with the accompaniment of a bloodymorningthe neutrals now proceeded to their respective homes and our twoassociates reached their domicile without the occurrence of furtherincidentnext morning the indicative double rittat of the postman induced thesquire from the breakfastparlor to the hall the servant had openedthe door and received the letters when an itinerant dealer in genuinearticles obtruded himself on the threshold and doffing his castor afterthe manner of a knowing one enquired whether his honor was pleased tobe spoke with tallyhoho desired him to step in and required to knowhis business the fellow with a significant wink and many prelusiveapologies for the liberty he was about to take stated that he hadaccidentally come into possession of some contraband goods chieflyhollands geneva and india silk handkerchiefs of prime andindisputable excellence which he could part with at unparalleled lowprices that he had already in this private way disposed of thegreatest portion and that if his honor was inclined to becomea purchaser he now had the opportunity of blending economy withsuperlative excellence in an almost incredible degree and unequalledin any part of the three kingdomsthis flourish the squire answered with becoming indignity expressed hissurprise at the consummate assurance of any trickster who would dareto offer him a contraband article to the prejudice of his majesty'srevenue and ordered the servant to turn the scoundrel out ofdoors the above mentioned fracas took place a few weeks agothe offenders against the peace of our sovereign lord theking were next day held before one of the policemagistrates when it appearing that the row occurred underthe influence of ebriety and that the landlord and thewatchmen were the only sufferers a compromise waspermitted and the parties were discharged with a suitableadmonition contraband articles the squire apparently was notaware that the superlatively excellent hollands geneva andindiahandkerchiefs were the one the manufacture ofspitalfields and the other the sophisticated balderdashknown by the name of maidstone gin it is a fact altho notgenerally known that at the different watering places everyseason the venders of silk handkerchiefs manufactured inspitalfields carry on a lucrative trade by disposing ofthem under the

returns to townimproved in health but more slender in person all her acquaintanceexclaiming la my dear how vastly thin you have grownthere are in london and its neighbourhood said dashall numeroussuch convenient asylums but i cannot acquiesce in their utility iam rather of opinion that they have a demoralizing tendency asaccelerating by concealment the progress of licentiousness humanfailings will still predominate and the indulgence of illicitintercourse is less frequently prevented by an innate principleof virtue than the dread of shame when facility of concealment istherefore given to the result these connexions will still become moreprevalentby the powers exclaimed sir felix but i think morality ought tofeel particularly benefited by these convenient asylums they preservereputation

dueto distinguished services and exalted genius which his grace verycourteously returned on the subject of convenient accommodation for ladieswho wish privately to ly in if we might hazard an opinionit would be in coincidence with that of our friend dashallthese establishments are certainly an encouragement tolicentiousness and it is well known that in many of thesereceptacles where the

nthe thirtytwo great personages exclaimed the duke sendup the dinner and your bill thus i must pay the penaltysaid he for not having invited the old veteran to be ofthe party the squire observed that the brilliant victories of his gracealthough acknowledged and rewarded by all the potentates of europe hadnot procured him much popularity at home the remark was confessed bydashall to be correct but whence the public indifference originated hecould not presume to explaincrossing hyde park which a celebrated physician denominated the lungsof the metropolis our pedestrians made their egress into oxfordroadthis fine street with longitudinal reference the first in londonexcited the admiration of the baronet the long line of perspectiveindeterminable to the view stretching from hyde park corner to stgiles's the general uniformity of the buildings the neatness and inmany instances the splendor of the tradesmen's shops together with thecomfortable manner of their perambulation jostled and unimpeded bythe hurry throng and bustle of passengers with which many otherparts of the town are annoyed gave an additional zest of enjoyment tothe trio in their excursion while the squire observed that he felt inthis part of the town always as if he had been suddenly removed tosome other region of the world far remote from the city of london itsdissonant uproar and crowded inconveniencesturning into blenheim street dashall apprized his companions that ifthey felt inclined to take a peep into the theatre of anatomy he couldprocure their admissionthe squire seemed to recoil from so disgusting an exhibition whileon the other hand the baronet expressed a great desire to enter thetheatre i have been used to murder and mutilation said hethe devil you have ejaculated the squire where howwhere else should it be but in ireland replied the baronet and asto the how was it not sure after the manner of my profession while iwas a member of a corps of yeoman cavalry during the rebellion when wewhipped hanged beheaded and mutilated men every day by dozens soyou may guess my good friend that cutting up a human carcaseis nothing new to me only now i should like to see if there is anydifference in the mangling of human bodies by the anatomical artistsof london from the cidevant military professors the loyal troop ofdonerailethe hesitation manifested by the squire yielded ultimately to theimportunity of the baronet and they entered the human shambles wherethe cutters up were at work upon a subject securing to themselves theadvantage of personal experience in the process of dissection theabdomen had been already cleared out and the corpse was portioned outto the different students of anatomy for the purpose of illustrationthe arms to one class the legs to another the head to a third c sothat in less than a quarter of an hour decapitation and dismembermentwere completely effected and the trunk was deserted as anuninteresting object from which there could not be derived anyinformation of importance further than that which the students hadalready obtainedsir felix whispered his friends that these adepts in human mutilationfar exceeded in apathy of feeling and adroitness of execution even thecidevant loyal troop of doneraile but when one of the young artistsbrought forward in his hands smeared with gore a human heart for theoperation of the dissecting knife tallyhoho declaring that he could bearit no longer rushed out of the theatre and was followed by his twocompanions all disgusted with this spoliation of the dead howeverconducive it might prove to the interests of the living the human subjects for these theatres of anatomy andprivate dissection are chiefly supplied byresurrectionists a class of depraved wretches whose onlyemployment is that of bodysnatching or robbing the gravesof their dead from which they derive a ready and lucrativeemolument the anatomists are ready at all hours to receivewithout questions asked

duty of the parish officers to prevent by resistingthe interment of bodies in iron coffins and this resolutionhas lately had the sanction of legal authorityproceeding along oxford street sir felix

when the attention of thetriumvirate was attracted by the appalling appearance of five menrivetted together and conducted along the street by officers ofjustice tallyhoho enquired into the nature of their crimes and wasinformed that they were in custody under suspicion of housebreaking inthe nighttime and that two of them particularly had been taken inthe house which they had plundered regaling themselves in perfectease with cold meat wine and liquors and the stolen property tied upin a bag with which on the moment of alarm they attempted an escapebut were intercepted in their retreat and taken in charge by theofficers after a desperate resistance in which shots and hurts werereceived both by the victors and the vanquished it is almost beyondbelief that men engaged in an enterprise

thursday night under circumstances ofrather an extraordinary kind mr miller's evidence was tothe following effect he has a cut glass and earthenwarewarehouse in thames street but does not reside there uponvisiting his warehouse yesterday morning he found thatthieves had been very busy upon the concern the nightbefore they did not get much but while they were in thehouse they enjoyed themselves they lighted a fire and paida visit to the winecellar from which they took two bottlesof wine and three bottles of perry which it seemed theydrank warm with sugar and mr miller received a very politeletter from one of them acknowledging the obligations theywere under to him for the excellent beverage his cellarafforded upon examining other parts of the premises mrmiller found that his iron chest had been forced open theinstrument a large chisel with which this feat wasperformed was lying on the premises and a dark lanthornwhich the thieves had forgotten was also picked up in thecourse of the search the petty cash drawers of the ironchest lay open empty but mr miller believed there had beenin them when he left the warehouse a sum perhaps notexceeding a couple of pounds the bills and papers were nottaken away neither had any thing been removed that waslikely to be recovered some silver cruettops were takenbut the cruets were left behind the chisel whichthough very strong had been broken in the effort to openthe chest was of the largest size all the rooms of thebuilding except those in front had been visited by thedepredators and there were various circumstances concurringto fix a very strong suspicion on the prisoner besides theprobability that he was the writer of the letter of thanksto mr miller for the entertainment afforded the letterwhich was written in a good hand began

family of my nextdoor neighbour retired to rest leaving every thing as they imaginedin a state of perfect security on the servant however coming downstairsin the morning he was surprised to find a new and unexpectedinmate fast asleep in the kitchen a quantity of plate packed up lay byhis side and before him were a bottle of brandy and another of winehe was a lad not more than sixteen years of age who had ingeniouslycontrived in the nighttime to get access to the house and havingsecured his spoil had resorted to the pantry and winecellar forrefreshment of the stores from the latter receptacle he had partakenso liberally that he was thrown into a deep slumber from which he wasroused by the unwelcome voice of the officer who had been sent for totake him into custodyour perambulators had now passed along the bridge and advanced a shortdistance on blackfriar's road when they observed a spacious travellingcaravan stationary by the side of the high way intimating that therewas to be seen

limpid rivuletonly passed the slope alluded to and here was a world of waters intowhich the influx of ten thousand such rivulets would produce no apparentincrease amidst these cogitations by the squire and others of anunknown description by dashall the boat passed underneath blacksmiths'bridge and the lofty doom of st paul burst upon the view of the twoassociates with gigantic majesty and withdrew from their minds everyimpression save that of the towering object in view superseding theconsideration of all else either present or retrospectiverest on your oars was the order now given by the two friends andwhile the waterman implicitly obeyed the mandate they gazed withenthusiasm on the stupendous edifice seen perhaps to better advantagefrom the river than from any other station and felt proud intheir affinity to a country and countryman capable the former ofinstituting and the latter of carrying into effect so august anundertaking during the building of st paul's church a

spacious span of each stretchingacross the thames in towering majesty affords an aquatic vista equallynovel and interestinggliding on the pacific wave the trimbuilt wherry now passed underthe lofty elevation of the centre arch and our observers were struckwith the contrast between the object of their admiration and its ancientneighbour london bridge that nameless shapeless bulk of stone andlime with its irregular narrow arches through which the pentupstream rushes with such dangerous velocitythis gothic hulk said the squire is a deformity in the aspect ofthe river and ought at least to be pulled down if not rebuiltadded his cousin even on the principle of economy the large andincessant expenditure in support of this decayed structure wouldbe much more profitably applied in the erection of a new bridge ofcorrespondent grandeur with the first metropolis in the universe butthe citizens seem inclined to protract the existence of this heavyfabric as a memento of the bad taste of their progenitorsfull many a gem of purest ray serenethe dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bearfull many a flower is born to blush unseenand waste its sweetness in the desert air the indefatigable waterman continued to ply his oars sansintermission and in a few minutes our two associates in adventurewere safely landed a short distance westward of the bridge afterremunerating the waterman they ascended the stairs with an appetitequickened by the water breeze and retired into the shades close athand for refreshment previous to a renewal of their excursionthe shades near london bridge is a house or rather cellar muchresorted to by respectable citizens of sober fame induced chiefly bythe powerful attraction of genuine wines which may here be had eitherdrawn immediately from the wood and served in

daily enjoyingthe exhilarating juice of the grape and further attracted by thepleasantness of situation as commanding a full view of the riverwhence the refreshing breeze is inhaled and enjoyedhere then our heroes recruited and while taking their wine bob wasmuch gratified by the performance of an itinerant band of musiciansplaying outside some of the latest and most popular airs in a masterlystyle of execution among other numerous refinements and improvementsof the age observed dashall may be considered that of our itinerantmetropolitan musicians for instead of the vile discordant and gratinghurdygurdy the mechanical organ grinder and the catgut scrapersawing a tune we have now parties who form themselves into smallbands of really scientific and able performers who from instrumentswell selected produce a combination of delightful melody and thisprogress of harmony is equally evident with respect to vocalists whofrequently posting themselves opposite some well frequented tavern orcoffeehouse amuse the inmates with catches glees duets c andtrust to the liberal feelings which the concord of sweet sounds mayhave inspired for remuneration and encouragementscarcely had dashall concluded his remarks when the musicalparty ceased their instrumental exertions and diversifying theentertainment one of the performers struck up a song which we

ouradventurers were now pursuing their way when they met with an incidentnot unworthy of observation do not leave your goods is the friendlyadmonition generally inscribed in large characters over the restingplace for porters throughout the metropolis opposite the church ofsaint magnus close by london bridge a porter having pitched hisload turned his back upon it and reclined himself against the post incareless ease and security it was just as our heroes approached thatthe porter had turned himself round to resume his burden when lo ithad vanished in what manner no one can tell without doubt one ofthose numerous streetprowlers who are continually on the look out forprey observing the remissness of the porter had availed himself of thefavourable opportunity and quietly walked off with his

moments shroudedunder the towering column of the monumentascending the spiral staircase of black marble consisting of threehundred and fortyfive steps winding like a corkscrew to the summitour aspirants reached their aerial station in the gallery of this loftyedifice and enjoyed one of the most variegated and extensively interesting prospects of any in the metropolis far as the eye couldreach skirting itself down the river a forest of tall masts appearedand the colours of all nations waving gaily in the breeze gave asplendid idea of the opulence and industry of the first commercial cityin the universe the moving panorama far beneath the giddy heightresembled the flitting figures of a camera obscura the spaciousthames was reduced to a brook the stately vessels riding on itsundulating wave seemed the dwarfish boats of the schoolboy navigatorand glancing on the streets and along london bridge horses dwindledin appearance to mice and carriages to children's toys after havingenjoyed during several minutes the prospects afforded by theirelevated position the two friends descended and with a feeling ofrelief again trod the safer and less difficult path of terra firma our observers now turned their direction westward and passed intolombard street chiefly formed of bankinghouses and other publicedifices this street said dashall is noted as the focus of wealththe point of convergence of civic riches and its respectable bankersare not more dignified by the possession of superabundant propertythan enhanced in the estimation of their fellowcitizens by strictlyconscientious honour and integrityand of these not the least important in selfconsequence is the jollycivic baronet continued dashall who has already come more than oncewithin the scope of our observationecce homo behold the man responded the squire and the baronetwas descried rolling his ponderous form from the opposite alley to hisbankinghouseit is rather unfortunate observed dashall that nature has not keptpace with fortune in liberality to the baronet profuse in giving hima colossal magnitude of person he exhibits a most disproportionableendowment of intellect unlike his great prototype sir john in onesense but yet resembling him in another he is not witty himself buthe occasions wit in othersyou are very fond of making a butt of me observed the baronet to abrother alderman by no means rejoined the latter i never was fondof an empty butt in my life is the worthy baronet inclined at timesasked the squire in his capacity of map to irradiate the gloom of ststephens o yes frequently particularly so when in the plenitude of hiswisdom he conceives that he can enlighten the house with a modicum ofinformation the last time i heard him hold forth was as an apologistfor the tumultuary loyalists at the mansion house meeting when hedelivered himself in a manner so heterogeneous of commonsense andso completely in a style of egotism as to excite the ridicule andrisibility of the whole house and discompose the gravity of even thespeaker himself the following is a strictly literal versification of the speechalluded tothe mansionhouse row and apology forthe loyalistsbeing a literal versification of the eloquent speech of sirw ll m c rt s baronet in the house of commons fridayfebruary on the presentation by mr john smith of thepetition of the merchants of londoni rise mr

on this house the impression is suchthe loyalists fully to clear and their leaderfrom charge at that meeting of boisterous procedurethe honourable baronet now sat down amid the ironical cheersof the treasury and the tumultuous laughter of the whole house the two partners in adventure had now reached the mansion housethe justice room was open and the friends ascended the stairs in orderto witness the equitable dispensation of right by the civic sovereignthe case now under investigation was a curious one and excited theinterest and amusement of a numerous auditorythe itinerant exhibitor of a dancing bear complained that the personproprietor of a small menage now summoned into the presence of hislordship illegally withheld from him a monkey his property and thecidevant associate of the ursine dancer aforesaidon the other hand the master of the menage roundly asserted that he wasthe rightful proprietor of the monkey and had been in possession of theanimal for several yearsmy lord said the master of the bear let the monkey be produced andi will abide by his choice between this man and me as his master thisproposition appearing reasonable and pug having been brought forward asevidence before giving his testimony made a respectful obeisance to thechief magistrate and so far as chattering and grinning were indicativeof his good intentions seemed desirous of expressing his courtesy tothe auditory in general after having stared about him for some timewith an inquisitive eye and corresponding gesticulation he discernedthe bearmaster and springing into his arms with all the eagerness ofaffectionate recognition expressed the utmost joy at the unexpectedmeeting and when the other claimant attempted to approach he repulsedhim in the most furious manner and clung to the friend of his electionwith renewed pertinacityunder these circumstances the monkey was adjudged to the bearmasteras his proper owner and pug and his friend left the justice room withmutual exchange of endearmentsnothing else meriting notice occurred to the two strangers in thistheir new scene of observation the civic sovereign having resigned thechair to one of the aldermen in order that he might

from the frequent sittings of thecourt and general crouded state of the gallery the perquisites must beconsiderablecustom in every thing bears sovereign sway answered dashall i knownot whence this is derived nor whose pockets are lined by the producebut you will probably be surprised to learn that a shilling admissionis only demanded on common occasions and that on trials of great publicinterest from one to two guineas has been paid by every individualobtaining admissionthe arrival of the judges now terminated this colloquy the lord mayorand several aldermen were in waiting to receive them and these sageexpounders of the law were conducted to the bench by the sheriffs oflondon and middlesex the chief magistrate of the city uniformly and ofright presiding at this court his lordship took his seat onthe same bench with the judges and the usual forms having been gonethrough the dispensation of justice commencedseveral prisoners were tried and convicted of capital felony during theshort space of time that our associated observers remained in courtbut the cases of these wretched men and the consciousness of theirimpending fate seemed in no respect to operate upon their minds asthey left the bar apparently with perfect indifferencean unfortunate man was next brought forward and accused of havingstolen from an auction room a couple of wine glasses he was ofrespectable demeanor and evidently had seen better days when askedwhat he had to allege in his defence the victim of misery preludinghis story with a torrent of tears told the following piteous tale ofdistresshe had been in business and sustained an unimpeachable integrity ofcharacter for many years independence seemed within his reach whenmisfortune equally unforeseen as inevitable at all points assailedhim in the course of one disastrous year death deprived him of hisfamily and adversity of his property he had unsuccessfully speculatedand the insolvency of several who were considerably indebted to him

apply forrelief the jury found him guilty but strongly recommended him tomercy the judge humanely observed that the least possible punishmentshould be inflicted on the prisoner he was then sentenced to a fineof one shilling and to be discharged a sum of money the spontaneousbounty of the spectators was immediately collected for him while oneof the jury promised him employment on his calling at his house onthe following day the gratitude of the poor man was inexpressiblethe sudden transition from the abyss of despair to the zenith of hopeseemed to overwhelm his faculties he ejaculated a blessing on hisbenefactors and departed dashall and his friend were much affected by this incidentanother however presently occurred of a more lively descriptionin the course of the next trial the counsellor on crossexamininga witness found occasion to address him with well my old bucki suppose you are one of those people who do not often go tochurch perhaps said the other if the truth were

other truesaid the man of law but do you know what they are laughing at whyi think in my heart rejoined the fellow that they take either me oryou to be a fool but i do not know whichthe judge at this repartee could not retain his gravity a tumult ofmirth pervaded the whole court and the discomfited counsellor adjustedhis wig and sat downduring the few minutes longer that our heroes remained nothing ofinterest occurring they withdrew and passing down the old bailey tolydgate street and from thence towards the temple they crossed fleetstreet and taking the direction of shire lane were induced by way ofinvestigating real life in its lowest classification to enter one ofthose too frequent receptacles of vice denominated coffee shopsthis was a house of notorious irregularity the occupant of which hadmore than once experienced the visitation of the law for his uttercontempt of social order and from the present appearance of his guestsit did not seem that legal interference had effected moral amendmentas our two friends entered this augean stable a whisper of surprisemingled with dismay went round the motley assemblage of femalestreetdrabs cracksmen and oglehunters and a wary glance ofsuspicion darted from the group many a time and oft on the newcomerswho notwithstanding kept possession of their seats and ordering withoutapparent notice of the party a cup of coffee apprehension subsided intosecurity the reassured inmates resumed their interrupted hilarity andour adventurers were thus afforded the means of censurable observation cracksmen burglars oglehunters pickpockets the squire who had not perused the annals of blackguardism andconsequently was not an adept in the knowledge of the slang or vulgartongue was under the frequent necessity of applying to his friend forexplanation of the obscure phraseology of those ladies and gentlemen ofthe pad which dashall contrived to occasionally interpret without theassistance or notice of its multitudinous learned professorsthe desire of witnessing the exhibition of real life in its loweststate of human degradation induced a prolongation of stay by our twoassociates in the meanwhile the mirth and fun grew fast and furiousexemplified by dance song and revelry interspersed with practicaljokes recriminate abuse and consequent pugilistic exercise wherescience and strength alternately prevailed and in deficiency of othermissiles poker tongs coffeecups saucers and plates were broughtinto active requisition the scene was a striking illustration ofconfusion worse confounded luckily our two observers were in asituation without the reach of injury they therefore smiled at thetumult and enjoyed the stormthe landlord now interfered in defence of his fragile propertypreliminaries of peace were agreed on through his high mediation andfinally ratified betwixt the contending parties ending as they beganlike many other conflicting powers statu quo ante bellum and now to serious business we'll advance says one of the king's ofbrentfordbut first let's have a dancethe present party followed exactly mr baye's proposition the dance andthe row over they now proceeded to serious businessseated in various groups each engaged itself in conversation whichfrom its almost inaudible expression was singularly contrasted with therecent tumultuous uproarthe next box where sat our two friends was occupied by cracksmen andoglehunters one of whom whose superior skill gave him an ascendancyover his associates had delineated on the table the plan of certainpremises and having given in a very low tone of voice a verbalillustration to his fellowlabourers with what intention it is notdifficult to conjecture observed we may as well pad walk it assir oliver the moon is not out to night the party to whom this remark was addressed prepared to pad itaccordingly when the desired egress was opposed by the entrance ofthree men who unbuttoning their great coats exhibited each a hangerand brace of pistols and took the whole community male and femaleinto safe custodythis was a coupdemain on the part of the captors and sustained withthe most perfect sang froid by the capturedthe officers next turned their attention to dashall and tallyhoho whogiving their cards and candidly explaining the motives which led theminto the temporary society of the prisoners they were treated withbecoming respect the officers with their captives proceeding ontheir route to bow street and our heros to the occurrence of futureadventuretallyhoho congratulated himself on his escape from expected mortificationand inconvenience but dashall whose more active and enterprizing mindwas not to be checked by trifles enjoyed the vague apprehensions of hisfriend and by way of making amends for the penance they had inflictedon themselves in shire lane agreed to dine and finish the evening at atavern in covent gardenthither then as they pursued their course the squire expressed hissurprise that a final stop was not put to scenes such as they had justwitnessed and all such places of nefarious rendezvous abolished by thevigilance of the policeon the contrary observed dashall it is the interest of thepolice not utterly to destroy these receptacles of vice they arethe toleration haunts of profligacy where the officers of justiceare generally assured of meeting the objects of their inquiry andtherefore under proper restrictions and an occasional clearancethe continuance of a minor evil is productive of public benefit byarresting the progress of infamy and preventing the extension ofcrimepassing along the strand the humane feelings of the squire were excitedby apparently a mutilated veteran seaman who in a piteous tone ofvoice supplicated his charitable consideration the applicant statedthat he had lost an arm and an eye and was deprived the use of a legin the service of his country without friend or home and entirelydestitute of the means of subsistence that he had no other resourcethan that of a humble reliance on public benevolence the squire withhis usual philanthropic promptitude drew out his purse but his friend intercepted the boon and inquired of the seaman under whom inwhat ship and in what action he had sustained his misfortunes to thesequestions a satisfactory answer was given and the claim of the man tocompassion and relief was about to be admitted when another inquiryoccurred are you a pensionera pause ensued in the interim the mendicant seeing a person approachof whose recognition he was not at all ambitious dropped in a momenthis timber toe unslung his arm dashed a patch from his eye and setoff with the speed of a racehorseduring the amazement of our two observers of real life excited by thissudden and unexpected transformation the officer for such was thequondam

exhibited his agility is one of the greatest imposters inlondon however i shall not run him down at present i know hishaunts and reckon sure of my game in the eveningi confess replied dashall that in the present instance i havebeen egregiously deceived i certainly am not up to all the tricks oflondon although neither a johnny raw nor a greenhorn and yet i wouldnot wish to prove callous to the claim of distress even if sometimesunguardedly bestowing the mite of benevolence on an undeserving objectthe society for the suppression of mendicity in the metropolis saidthe officer think differently they recommend that no relief should begiven to streetbeggarsthen said dashall offended by the officer's interference i envythem not the possession of their feelings and the two friends renewedtheir walkproceeding without further interruption our pedestrians were inducedto intermingle with a crowd which had collected round a man who worea most patriarchal redundancy of beard and had been recognized by anacquaintance as a shoemaker of the name of cooke a disciple of theamerican prophet john decker their high mightiness the mobility were mischievously inclinedand would certainly have grossly insulted if not injured thepoor devotee had not dashall and his friend taken him under theirprotectionist he had been quietly making his way through covent gardenmarket when the greetings and surprise of his friend at his strangetransformation attracted the curiosity of the multitude and hisunhesitating declaration that he meant to accompany the great prophetto jerusalem excited derision and indignation against the unfortunateenthusiast when luckily our two heros interposed their good offices andconducted the proselyte in safety to the shakespeare tavern on monday in consequence of a very great uproar on sundaynight in worcester street southwark about the house ofthe american prophet john decker that singular person wasbrought before the magistrates of this office theinhabitants of the neighbourhood having attributed thedisturbance to the unfortunate fanaticism of the prophet andhis followersthe constables stated that on sunday night at halfpasteight o'clock they saw a mob consisting of about threehundred people collected at the door of the house andheard the cries of murder issue from within the officerson going up stairs found the prophet lying on his backsome persons who had been abusing him escaped and theprophet said the cause of their violence was that he hadrefused to get out of his bed to preach he was conveyed tothe watchhouse the witnesses informed the magistrate thatthe prophet had made some proselytes who were actuallyabout to leave the country with him and accompany him uponan expedition to the holy land the parish officers werenaturally alarmed at the inconveniences to which such anemigration would expose them and hoped that every thing thearm of the law could do projected entertainment amidst the busy note of preparation the important day at lastarrived the suite of apartments became thronged with company and everyoneadmired the elegance of the furniture the tasteful ornaments ofthe rooms the brilliancy of the lights and massive construction of thevaluable family plate in fact every thing conspired to give eclat tothe scene and confirm the friends of the founder of the feast in theirbelief alike of his exquisite judgment and high respectabilitythe silversmith that he might not appear indelicately obtrusive let afew days elapse after this grand gala had taken place before he appliedfor restoration of his property the borrower congratulated him on hisgood fortune told him that several friends had very much admired theplate and even expressed an intention of ordering similar services andthat with regard to the borrowed plate he had taken so strong a fancyto it as to feel disposed to become a purchaser if the price wasreasonable and an adequate consideration was made for prompt paymentthe silversmith who chuckled inwardly at the prospect of extendinghis business and connecting himself with so many honourable mengratefully expressed his acknowledgments and assuring him of liberaldealing the several items of the borrowed plate were examined anddilated upon the price of each article after much higgling wasultimately fixed the sum total ascertained and an early clay appointedfor a final settlement of the accompt it never was the intention of theborrower to return the plate but he now had achieved a great objectby entirely changing the whole complexion of the business he had nowconverted fraud into debt and happen what might the silversmith couldonly sue him on a civil process which against a limb of the law andas such privileged from arrest must be tedious and uncertain whereashad he made away with the plate without accomplishing the object ofthis last manoeuvre such is the indiscriminating severity of englishlaw that he might have been amenable to the punishment of felonynow comes the reckoning when the banquet's o'er the parties metfor final settlement when behold the accepted purchaser offers thesilversmith a bill at a month he refuses it indignantly and consultshis solicitor as to the possibility of compelling the restoration of theplate but the lawyer told him that on his own shewing this could notbe done the silversmith had now no other resource than that of takingthe proposed bill and waiting the expiration of the month forpayment in the meanwhile the debtor exhibiting the talent of an ableconveyancer transmuted the silver into gold and now laughs at thecredulity of london tradesmen and sets the silversmith at defiance this incident as related by dash all actually and veryrecently occurredan interesting and useful volume might be compiled on thesubject of frauds practised on london tradesmen many ofthese tricks have been highly characteristic of ingenuitythe following is a ludicrous instance of female stratagemwe give the article literally as it occurreda few days ago a female apparently a person of rankvisited in her carriage towards the evening a silkmercer's shop westward of temple bar where she madechoice for purchase of silks and other rich articles offeminine dress and decoration to the value of above fiftypounds her manner was that of a perfectly wellbredgentlewoman and her person displayed no small portion ofattractive and elegant accomplishment having completedher selection she expressed much regret that she could notpay the amount of the bill on the instant butshecontinued it is a delightful evening my house is in thesuburbs of town a short and easy ride will prove a pleasantrecreation and if you will accompany me home in mycarriage you shall on our arrival be immediately paidthe mercer was more gallant of spirit than to reject thecourtesy of a lady so fair and fascinating and acceptingwith pleasure the preferred honour the vehicle soonreached its destination the lady first alighted takingwith her into an elegant mansion the articles ofpurchase the mercer presently followed was shewn into ahandsome drawingroom and received with much politeness byapparently by a gentleman of the faculty a silence of afew minutes ensued when the mercer inquired for the ladyobserving at the same time that it was necessary he shouldreturn to town immediately the courteous physicianrecommended silence and the mercer became irritated andclamorous for his money and freedom of exit twoattendants making their appearance they were directed toconduct the patient to his apartment the mercersuspecting that he was the dupe of artifice grasped apoker with the intention of effectking at all hazard hisliberation from durance vile but his efforts had no otherresult than that of confirming his trammels and he waspresently bound over to keep the peace under the guaranteeof a straightwaistcoat the unfortunate mercer now told aplain unvarnished tale which gained the attention of thehumane physician who was no other than the proprietor ofthe mansion in which he managed its concerns as an asylumfor lunatics the lady who accompanied the mercer to thehouse had been with the physician the preceding day andmade arrangements with him for the reception of an insanepatient it was now discovered that she had come under afictitious name had retreated in the hired vehicle with themercer's property and had adopted this curious stratagemthe more effectually to silence suspicion and preventdetection this detail threw the squire into a train of rumination on thetricks and chicanery of metropolitan adventurers while dashall amusedhimself with the breakfasttable concomitant the newspaper a fewminutes only elapsed when he laid it aside approached the windowand seeing a

the greater villain with a feecousin bob was very much surprised by this sudden effusion andinquiring the source of inspiration dashall put into his hands thenewspaper pointing to the following extraordinary communicationextracted verbatim the king v cundick this was an indictment against thedefendant undertaker to the cheesemongerlane gaol for amisdemeanour in corruptly selling for dissection the bodyof a capital convict after he had been executed contraryto his duty in violathon of public decency and thescandal of religion there were various counts in theindictment charging the offence in different ways thedefendant pleaded not guiltythe case excited considerable interest as well for itsunprecedented novelty as the singularity of itscircumstances it was a public prosecution at the instanceof the magistracy of the countymr nolan and mr holland conducted the case for the crownand mr adolphus mr burton and mr roland were forthe defenceit appeared in evidence that a capital convict named edwardlee who had been tried and found guilty at the lastcroydon assizes of a highway robbery was publicly executedat horsemongerlane gaol on monday the tooth of septemberafter he was cut down he was delivered over to thedefendant the appointed carpenter and undertaker of thegaol for interment at the county's expense for which hewas allowed three guineas he received particulardirections that the afflicted mother and other friends ofthe deceased were to be permitted to see the body beforeinterment and follow it to the grave if they thoughtproper the friends of the deceased called on thedefendant who lives in redcrossstreet to know when thefuneral would take place he appointed the following daytuesday the th of september the unhappy mother of thedeceased being confined to her bed was unable to attendthe funeral but sent a friend to the house of the defendantto see the body and cut a lock of its hair applicationbeing made to the defendant for this purpose he said he hadalready buried the body because he could not keep suchpeople any longer in his house the friend demanded acertificate of the funeral which he promised to procure ona subsequent day upon paying a fee on the thursdayfollowing the uncle of the deceased called for a certificateof the burial but could not get it the defendant thensaying that the body had been buried the day before thefriends then became clamorous and complaint being made tomr walter the gaoler he sent repeatedly for the defendantto come to the gaol and explain his conduct which hedeclined at length one of the turnkeys was sent afterhim on the friday with positive directions to bring himforthwith as soon as the defendant found that he wascompelled to go to mr walter he made an excuse that hehad some immediate business to attend to but would meet themessenger in an hour at a neighbouring publichouse tothis the turnkey consented but watched the defendant to hishouse where he saw two or three suspicious looking menlurking about after waiting for some time the defendantcame to him and expressed his surprise that he was not goneto the publichouse the defendant appeared agitated andwent off as hard as he could towards the southwark ironbridge a person named crisp who was with the turnkeywent one way after the defendant and the turnkey anotherthe latter went to crawford's burial ground where he sawthe same suspicious looking man whom he had observed aboutthe defendant's house in the act of interring a coffinhe immediately interposed and said the coffin should not beburied until he examined its contents at this momentthe defendant came into the buryingground andseemed angry at the interruption and begged hemight be allowed to inter the body which he acknowledgedwas edward lee and excused himself for not burying itbefore by saying that the pressure of other businessprevented him the turnkey remonstrated with him fordisobedience of the orders he had received to permit thefriends of the deceased to see the body and attend thefuneral the defendant seemed greatly perplexed at lengthhe took hold of crisp and the turnkey by the sleeve andwith considerable agitation offered them l each topermit him to bury the coffin and say no more about thematter this was peremptorily refused the turnkey insistedupon opening the coffin and whilst the defendant went toexplain his conduct to mr walter he did open it and foundthat it contained nothing but earth it appeared that thedefendant had been applying to the sexton in the course ofthe week for a certificate of the burial but was unable tosucceed the body not having been buried search was thenmade for the body and at length it was traced to mrbrooks's dissecting rooms in blenheimstreet marlboroughstreetwhere it had undergone a partial dissection theupper part of the scull had been removed but replacedseveral persons identified the body as that of edward leeit was proved that about ten o'clock in the evening oftuesday the th september a hackneycoach had stopped atthe defendant's house and the defendant was seen assistingtwo men in lifting a large hamper into the carriage whichthen drove off this was the substance of the case for theprosecutionmr adolphus in an able and ingenious address to the jurycontended that the indictment must fail inasmuch as theevidence did not satisfy the allegation in the indictmentthat the defendant had sold the body for lucre and gain nowthere was no proof whatever that it had been sold whichmight have easily been made out if the fact was so bysummoning mr brooks the anatomist the real fact was thatthe body had been stolen by other persons from thedefendant's house and the defendant had been driven to themiserable shifts proved in evidence in order to conceal themisfortune and prevent the loss of his lucrative situationin the gaolno witnesses to facts were called for the defendant butseveral persons gave him a good character for honesty andindustrythe jury under the learned judge's directions found thedefendant guilty the squire having perused this appalling account of humandepravity expressed himself in energetic terms of indignation againstthe miscreant who to the acute miseries of maternal affliction atthe premature loss of a son and by such a death could add the bitteranguish of consigning his cold remains unseen by any earthly spirit ofsympathy to the knife of the dissector in breach of every law moraland divine in the warmth of his kindly feelings the squire would haveuttered a curse had he not been prevented by the entrance of

objections to the hand as a partner at the ball of miss judithmacgilligan even should she choose to array herself after the mannerof the princess her grandmother but dashall observing that as no masqueballs were given at the mansionhouse it would be necessary that missmacgilligan should forego her intention of appearing otherwise thanin modern costume sir felix undertook to arrange this point withhis relative and in the name and on behalf of squire tallyhoho ofmelvillehall to engage the distinguished honour of her hand atthe ensuing mansionhouse ball this important affair having beensatisfactorily adjusted it was proposed by dashall that as his cousinand the baronet had neither of them ever been present at the epping hunton easter monday they should form themselves into a triumvirate for thepurpose of enjoying that pleasure on the morrow the squire having intown two hunters from his own stud embraced the proposition withthe avidity of a true sportsman and sir felix declining the offer ofone of these fleetfooted coursers it was agreed they should be underthe guidance of tom and bob and that sir felix should accompany themmounted on his own sober gelding early in the morning to the field ofnimrod from which they purposed to return to town in sufficient time towitness other holiday sports before dressing for the entertainment atthe mansionhousethese

began to trotwhich galled him in his seatand as if intuitively knowing the incapacity of his rider to restrainhim and despising curb and rein the indignant animal set off at fullspeed to the great dismay of dashall and the squire who putting theirhorses to the pith of their mettle hurried after their friend with theutmost solicitude luckily however the career of the spirited animalwas impeded and finally stopped by the frequent interposition of thepassengers on the road and the baronet was safely set down ready toexclaim with hawser trunnion if ever i get astride the back ofsuch another

having the bestpart of the day still before them set out on a stroll to tothillfieldsfair with the view of ascertaining real life in westminster amongstthe middle and lower orders of its extensive population crossing st james's park our two observers soon reached thescene of jollity here as in all the fairs held in london and itsvicinity was a vast assemblage of idlers including both sexes and allages they talk of the severity of the times said dashall and thedistress of the lower orders of society i cannot say however that ihave witnessed any semblance of distress or privation amongst such inthis metropolis to the extent represented in the whole course of myobservation these fairs for instance more properly marts of iniquityare crammed to excess and in pursuit of low enjoyment there appears nodeficiency of pecuniary means in all these resorts of dissipationnot only the shows are filled with spectators but the booths andneighbouring publichouses are crowded with male and female revellersthe squire acquiesced in the correctness of his friend's remark andboth coincided in opinion that the regular daily public places ofamusement in the metropolis afford ample opportunity for rationalrecreation independent of the continuance of fairs which have no othertendency than facilitating the progress of licentiousnessdashall observed that on the present occasion in the midst of so muchalleged distressthe booths and shows of tothillfields fair weremuch more extensive than in former years we must however said healthough the evil continues do the magistrates the justice to saythat they have acted meritoriously in preventing the erection of thosedangerous machines named roundabouts by which at former fairs manyserious accidents were occasionedillustration pages donkey cart racewhile ton and bob were quizzing the costermongers and the sensesthey in their turn were queered out of their wipes thus anothercogent argument was afforded as to the necessity of suppressing thesenuisances as being the rendezvous of infamy and the harvest ofdepredation the visitors appeared in all their glory as elegantand boisterous as usual the consumption of gin and gingerbread wasapparently prodigious and the great luxury amongst the fashionables wasfried sausages and the bolting of oysters with sugar for wagers havinglost their wipes the two friends resolved at least to save theirtattlers and having seen a sufficiency of westminster jollificationthey left the fair to those visitors who might better appreciate itsenjoymentreturning home they were not encountered by farther mischance andhaving shortly reached their destination and dressed for the eveninggala a chariot was ordered and they were set down at the lodgings ofsir felix o'o'gradythe baronet introduced his two friends to his aunt with much affectedform and with an arch leer of expression which on an occasion ofminor import would have excited the risibility of bob but this was nolaughing affair the

was select andelegant the ladies particularly might vie in splendour of ornament andfascination of personal charms with first rate beauties of the westand what gave the entertainment a superior zest

is offered to us to dayfor a peep at the citizens of london in their legislative assembly acourt of common council is announced for twelve o'clock and i think ican promise you much of entertaining information by paying a visit atguildhall and its vicinity we have several times passed it with merelytaking a view of its exterior but the interior is equally deserving ofattention particularly at a period when it is graced by the personagesand appendages which constitute its state and dignity london isgenerally spoken of as the first commercial city in the known world andits legislators as a corporate body becomes a sort of rallying postfor all others in the kingdom we have plenty of time before us andmay lounge a little as we march along to amuse or refresh ourselves atleisure with all my heart said tallyhoho for i have heard muchabout the lord mayor the sword bearer and the common hunt all in abustle though i have never yet had an opportunity of seeing any ofthem they are interesting subjects i can assure you so come alongwe will take a view of these goes and magog of civic notorietyand thus saying they were quickly on the road for the city the morningbeing fine they took their way down st james's street at the bottomof which their ears were attracted by the sounds of martial musicapproachingwe have nicked the time nicely indeed said dashall and may nowenjoy a musical treat before we proceed to the oratorical one theguards in and about the palace are relieved every morning about thistime for which purpose they are usually mustered at the horseguardsin the park where they are paraded in regular order and then marchedhere it forms a very pleasing sight for the cockney loungers for thoseout of employ and those who have little inclination to be employed andyou see the crowds that are hastening before them in order to obtainadmission to palace yard before their arrival let us join the throngthere is another detachment stationed there ready to receive themand while they are relieving the men actually on duty the two bandsalternately amuse the officers and the byestanders with some of themost admired overtures and military airsthey now passed the gate and quickly found themselves in a motley groupof all descriptions crowding to the seat of action and pouring infrom various avenues men women and children halfdrilled drummersbandylegged fifers and suckling triangle beaters with bags of booksand instruments in their hands to assist the band the colours weremounted as usual on a post in the centre the men drawn up in ranks andstanding at ease while the officers were pacing backwards and forwardsin the front arminarm with each other relating the rencontres of thepreceding day or those in anticipation of the ensuing this order ofthings was however quickly altered as the relieving party enteredand at the word attention every officer was at his post and the menunder arms our friends now moved under the piazzas so as to be in therear of the party who had the first possession and after hearing withgreat admiration the delightful airs played by the two bands whichhad been the principal object of attraction with them they proceededthrough the park and reached charing cross by the way of springgardens zounds said tallyhoho this is a very unworthy entrance to aroyal parkadmitted it is so was the reply and a degradation to the splendidpalace i mean internally which is so close to it and which is thepresent residence of majesty they now proceeded without anythingfurther of consequence worthy of remark till they reachedvilliersstreetcome said tom i perceive we shall have time to take a look at theworld below as well as the world above when crossing into the delphiand suddenly giving another turn he entered what to bob appeared acavern and in one moment was obscured from his sight hallo saidtallyhoho where the devil are you leading me to never mind was thereply keep on the right side and you are safe enough but if you getinto the centre beware of the slough of despond don't be afraidupon this assurance bob groped his way along for a few paces and at adistance could discover the glimmering of a lamp which seemed but tomake darkness more visible keeping his eye upon the light and moreengrossed with the idea of his own safety in such a place than any thingelse for he could neither conjecture where he was nor whence he wasgoing he presently came in violent contact with a person whom he couldnot see and in a moment found himself prostrate on the groundhallo cried a gruff voice which sounded through the hollow archesof the place with sepulchral tone who the devil are you why don'tyou mind where you go you must not come here with your eyes in yourpocket and at the same time he heard a spade dug into the earth whichalmost inspired him with the idea that he should be buried alivegood god protect exclaimed bob where is dashall where am iwhere are you why you're in the mud to be sure and for aught i knowdashall and all the rest may be in the clouds what business have youdashing here we have enough of the dandies above without having thembelow what have you lost your way or have you been nibbling in thelight and want to hide yourself eh neither neither i can assure you but i have been led hereand my friend is on beforeoh well if that's the case get up and i'll hail himeyyaap cried he in a voice which seemed like thunder to ourfallen hero and which was as quickly answered by the well known voiceof his cousin who in a few minutes was at his elbowwhat now vociferated tom i thought i gave you instructions how tofollow and expected you was just behind mewhy for the matter of that cried the unknown he was not beforeyou that's martin and he knocked himself down in the mud before everi spoke to him that's all i know about it but he don't seem tounderstand the navigation of our partsi don't wonder at that replied tom for he was never here before inhis life but there is no harm done is therenone replied bob all's right again now so proceednay replied the unknown all's not right yet for if as how thisis your first appearance in the shades below it is but fair you shouldcome downdown said bob why i have been down you knock'd me downwell never mind my master i have set you on your pins again andbesides that i likes you very well for you're down as a hammer andup again like a watchbox but to my thinking a drap o'somut good wouldrevive you a little bit and i should like to drink with you for youought to pay your footingand so he shall continued tom so come along my ladby this time bob had an opportunity of discovering that the person hehad thus unfortunately encountered was no other than a stout rawbonedcoalheaver and that the noise he had heard was occasioned by hissticking his pointed coalshovel in the earth with intention to helphim up after his fall pursuing their way and presently turning to theright bob was suddenly delighted by being brought from utter darknessinto marvellous light presenting a view of the river with boats andbarges passing and repassing with their usual activitywhat place is this inquired tallyhoho before you replied his cousin is the river thames andin the front you will find wharfs and warehouses for the landing andhousing of various merchandize such as coals fruit timber c wearenow under the delphi terrace where many elegant and fashionablehouses are occupied by persons of some rank in society these streetslanes and subterraneous passages have been constructed for theconvenience of conveying the various articles landed here into the mainstreets of the metropolis and form as it were a little world undergroundand no bad world neither replied the coalheaver who upon inspectionproved to be no other than bob martlet whom they had met with as oneof the heavy wet party at charley's crib for there is many a familylives down here and gets a good bit of bread too what does it signifywhere a man gets his bread if he has but an honest appetite to eat itwith aye and though i say it that house in the corner there justdown by the water's edge can supply good stuff at all times to washit down with and that you know's the time of day my master this warmweather makes one dryish like don't ittom thought the hint dry enough though bob was declaring he was almostwet through however they took their road to the fox under the hillas it is termed on entering which a good fire presented itself andtallyhoho placed himself in front of it in order to dry his clotheswhile bob martlet was busy in inquiring of the landlord for a brush togive the german a wipe down as he observed he had a sort of a trip upin these wild parts though to be sure that there was no great wonderfor a gentleman who was near sighted and didn't wear spectacleshowever continued he there an't no harm done and so the german andi are going to drink together ain't we sirtallyhoho who by this time had got well roasted by the fireside noddedhis assent and dashall inquired what he would like why my master as for that it's not much matter to me adrap of sky blue in a boulter of barley with a dollop of sweetand a little saw dust is no bad thing according to my thinking butlord bless you if so be as how a german like you offers to treat billmartlet a boulter of barley a drink or a pot of porter a dollop of sweet sugar sawdust a cant term for ginger or nutmeg gratedwhy bill martlet never looks a gift horse in the mouth you know as theold saying is but our landlord knows how to make such rum stuff as ishould like you to taste it we call it hot don't us landlord comelend us hold of the brush ave and brush up mr landlord said thehon tom dashall let us have a taste of this nectar he's talking offor we have not much time to stoplord bless your eye sight replied martlet there an't no occasionwhatsoever for your honours to stay if you'll only give the orderand push about the possibles the business is all done come shovel upthe sensible continued he to the landlord mind you give us the realdouble xx i don't think your coat is any the worse it would serve mefor a sunday swell toggery for a twelvemonth to come yet for our dirtdown here is as i may say clean dirt and d me if i don't think itlooks all the better for itthank you my friend said bob that will do very well and thelandlord having by this time completed his cookery produced the goodstuff as martlet termed itcome gentlemen this is the real right sort nothing but the banguparticle ain't it my master but as i always likes the landlord totaste it first by way of setting a good example just be after tellingus what you think of itwith all my heart said the landlord who declared it was as prime apot of hot as he had made for the last fortnight with this recommendation our friends tried it and after tipping tooktheir departure under the positive assurance of martlet that he shouldbe very glad to see them again at any timethey now pursued their way through other subterraneous passages wherethey met waggons carts and horses apparently as actively and usefullyemployed as those above groundcome said tom we have suffered time to steal a inarch upon us asthey reached the strand we will therefore take the first rattlerwe can meet with and make the best of our way for the city thiswas soon accomplished and jumping into the coach the old

fully aware that city appointments fortwelve o'clock mean one was nevertheless anxious to arrive at theirplace of destination some time before the commencement of the businessof the day and fortunately meeting with no obstruction on the roadthey were set down at the corner of kingstreet about halfpast twelvecome said he we shall now have time to look about us at leisureand observe the beauties of this place of civic festivity the hall yousee in front of you is the place devoted to the entertainment usuallygiven by the lord mayor on his entrance upon the duties and dignities ofhis office it is a fine gothic building in which the various courtsof the city are held the citizens also meet there for the purpose ofchoosing their representatives in parliament the lord mayor sheriffsc it was originally built in the year previous to which periodthe public or as they term it the common hall was held at a small roomin aldermanbury the expense of the building was defrayed by voluntarysubscription and its erection occupied twenty years it was seriouslydamaged by the fire of since which the present edifice with theexception of the new gothic front has been erected that howeverwas not finished till the year and many internal improvements anddecorations have been introduced since there is not much of attractionin its outward appearance that new building on the right has recentlybeen erected for the accommodation of meetings of bankrupts and on theleft is the justiceroom where the aldermen attend daily in rotation asmagistrates to decide petty causes but we must not exhaust our time nowupon themon entering the hall tallyhoho appeared to be highly pleased with itsextent and was presently attracted by the monuments which it containsit is a noble room said he yes replied tom this hall is feet in length in breadth and the height to the roof is tallyhoho was however more engaged in examining the monument erected tothe memory of lord nelson and an occasional glance at the two enormousfigures who stand at opposites on the left of the entrance havingread the tablet and admired the workmanship of the former he hastilyturned to the latter and who in the name of wonder are these heinquiredthese replied his communicative cousin are called gog andmagog they are two ancient giants carved in wood one holding along staff suspending a ball stuck with pikes and the other a albertsupposed to be of great antiquity and to represent an ancient britonand a saxon they formerly used to stand on each side of that staircasewhich leads to the chamberlain's office the courts of king's bench andcommon pleas the court of aldermen and the common council chamber atthe other end are two fine monuments to the memory of lord chatham thefather of mr pitt and his son the windows are fine specimens ofthe revived art of painting on glass there is also a monument of mrbeckfordwhile they were taking a view of these several objects of curiositytheir attention was suddenly attracted by a confused noise and bustleat the door which announced the arrival of the lord mayor and hisattendants who passed them in state and were followed by our friendsto the council chamber on entering which they were directedby the city marshall who guarded the door to keep below the bartallyhoho gazed with admiration and delight on the numerous pictures withwhich the chamber is decorated as well as the ceiling which forms adome with a skylight in the centre the lord mayor having first enteredthe court of aldermen the business of the day had not yet commencedtom directed his cousin's eye in the first instance to the very largeand celebrated painting by copley which fronts the lord mayor'schair and represents the destruction of the floating batteries beforegibraltar to commemorate the gallant defence of that place by generalelliott afterwards lord heath field in the statue of the lateking george the third the death of david rizzio by opine the miseriesof civil war from shakespeare domestic happiness exemplified inportraits of an alderman and his family the death of wat tyler therepresentation of the procession of the lord mayor to westminster hallby water and the ceremony of swearing in the lord mayor at guildhallin containing portraits of all the principal members of thecorporation of london at that time meanwhile the benches were fillingwith the deputies and common councilmen from their several wards at oneo'clock the lord mayor entered the court attended by several aldermenwho took their seats around him and the business of the day commencedamong those on the upper seats tom gave his cousin to understand whichwere the most popular of the aldermen and named in succession messrswaithman wood sir claudius stephen hunter birch flower and curtisand as their object was not so much to hear the debates as to see theform and know the characters he proposed an adjournment from theirpresent rather uncomfortable situation where they were obliged to standwedged in by the crowd continually increasing during which they couldtake a few more observations and he could give some little clue to theorigin and present situations of the persons to whom he had directed hiscousin's attention making the best of their way out of the court theyfound themselves in an antiroom surrounded by marshalsea beadles ofwards waiting for their aldermen and the lord mayor's and sheriffs'footmen finding almost as much difficulty to proceed as they hadbefore encountered having struggled through this formidable phalanx of judicialand state appendagesnow said dashall we shall be enabled to breathe again at libertyand make our observations without fear for where we have just quittedthere is scarcely any possibility of making a remark without having itsnapped up by newspaper reporters and retailers of anecdotes herehowever we can indulge ad libitum yes replied tallyhoho and having seen thus far i am a littleinquisitive to know more i have it is true at times seen the namesof the parties you pointed out to me in the daily prints but a sight oftheir persons in their official stations excites stronger curiositythen said tom according to promise i will give you a sort ofbrief sketch of some of them the present lord mayor is a very eminentwholesale stationer carrying on an extensive trade in queenstreethe ought to have filled the chair before this but some temporarycircumstances relative to his mercantile concerns induced him to give uphis rotation he has since removed the obstacle and has been electedby his fellowcitizens to the high and important office of chiefmagistrate i believe he has not signalized himself by any remarkablecircumstance but he has the character of being a worthy man perhapsthere are few in the court of aldermen who have obtained more deservedlythe esteem of the livery of london than alderman waithman whoseexertions have long been directed to the correction of abuses and whorepresented them as one of their members during the last parliamentwhen he displaced the mighty alderman curtis waithman is of humbleorigin and has like many others of civic notoriety worked his wayby perseverance and integrity as a linendraper to respectableindependence and the hearts of his fellowcitizens he has served theoffice of sheriff and during that time acted with a becoming spirit atthe death of the late queen by risking his own life to save others hispolitical sentiments are on the opposition side consequently he is nofavorite with ministersand if he were replied tallyhoho that would scarcely be considered anhonourtrue continued tom but then it might lead to profit as it has donewith many others though he appears to hold such very light alderman wood has not yet been so fortunate as the celebratedwhittington whom you may recollect was thrice lord mayor of london buthe has had the honour to serve that office during two succeeding yearshe is a member of parliament and his exertions in behalf of the latequeen if they have done him no great deal of good among the higherpowers are at least honourable to his heartof sir claudius stephen hunter there is but little to be saidexcept that he has served the office and been a colonel of the citymilitia led off the ball at a jew's wedding used to ride a whitecharger and is so passionately fond of military parade that hadhe continued another year in the office the age of chivalry wouldcertainly have been revived in the east and knightserrant and esquireshave completely superseded merchants traders and shopkeepersalderman birch is an excellent pastrycook and that perhaps is thebest thing that can be said of him he has written some dramatic piecesbut the pastry is beyond all comparison best of the two and he needs noother passport to fame at least with his fellowcitizensbut last though not least under our present consideration comes therenowned sir william a plain bluff john bull he is said to be theson of a presbyterian citizen and was rigidly educated in his father'sreligion he obtained the alderman's gown and represented the city inthe year he is a good natured and i believe a good hearted manenough though he has long been a subject for satirical wit he was lordmayor in you may recollect what was related of him by the literarylabourer we met with in the park anecdotes and caricatures have beenpublished in abundance upon him he may however be considered invarious points of view as an alderman and a biscuit baker as afisherman how cried tallyhohowhy as a fisherman he is the polyphemus of his timehis rod was made out of the strongest oakhis line a cable which no storm e'er brokehis hook was baited with a dragon's tailhe sat upon a rock and bobbed for a whalebesides which continued dashall he is a great sailor has a yachtof his own and generally accompanies royalty on aquatic excursions i remember a laughablecaricature exhibiting the alderman in his own vessel with a turtlesuspended on a pole with the following lines in imitation ofblackeyed susan said to be written by mr jekyllall in the downs the fleet lay moor'dthe streamers waving in the windwhen castlereagh appeared on boardah where shall i my curtis findtell me ye jovial sailors tell me truedoes my fat william sail among your crewhe is a banker a loanmonger and a contractor a member of parliamentand an orator added to which he may be said to be a man of witand humour at all events he is the cause of it in others his firstoccupations have procured him great wealth and his wit and humour greatfamethe worthy alderman's hospitality to the late good humoured andgossiping james boswell the humble follower and biographer of drjohnson is well known and it is probable that the pleasures of thetable in which no man more joyously engaged shortened his life towrite the life of a great man is no easy task and to write that of abig one may be no less arduous whether the alderman really expected tobe held up to future fame by the biographer of johnson cannot bevery easily ascertained however that wish and expectation if it everexisted was completely frustrated by the death of poor boswelli recollect to have seen some lines of the worthy alderman on theglorious victory of the nile which shew at once his patriotism hiswit and his resolution in that he is not to be laughed out of thememorable toast he once gavegreat nelson in the grandest stilebore down upon the shores of nileand there obtained a famous victorywhich puzzled much the french directorythe impudence of them there fellowsas all the newspapers do tell ushad put the grand turk in a petwhich caus'd him send to nelson an aigrettelikewise a grand pelisse a noble boonthen let us hope a speedy peace and soon whether the following lines are from the same hand or notwe are unable to ascertain at least they wear a greatsimilarity of characteri give you the three glorious c'sour church constitution and kingthen fill up three bumpers to three noble vswine women and whale fishking egad said bob if this be true he appears to knock uprhymes almost as well as he could bake biscuits smothering a laughwhy replied dashall i believe that it has not been positivelyascertained that these lines which unlike other poetry contain nofiction but plain and undeniable matter of fact were wholly indicatedby the worthy alderman indeed it is not impossible but that hisworship's barber might have had a hand in their composition it wouldbe hard indeed if in his operations upon the alderman's pericraniumhe should not have absorbed some of the effluvia of the wit and geniuscontained therein and in justice to this operator on his chin andcaput i ought to give you a specimen which was produced by him upon theelection of his lordship to the mayoraltyour present mayor is william curtisa man of weight and that your sort isthis epigrammatic distich which cannot be said to be destitute ofpoint upon being read at table received as it deserved a large shareof commendation and his lordship declared to the company present thatit had not taken his barber above three hours to produce it extemporetallyhoho laughed heartily at these satirical touches upon the pooraldermanhowever continued tom a man with plenty of money can bear laughingat and sometimes laughs at himself though i suspect he will hardlylaugh or produce a laugh in others by what he stated in his seat inthe house of commons on the subject of the riots at knightsbridgei suspect his wit and good humour will hardly protect him in thatinstance on a motion made by mr favell in the court of commoncouncil on the st of march the following resolution waspassed indicative of the opinion that court entertained ofthe conduct of alderman curtis on the occasion here alludedtothat sir william curtis bart having acknowledged in hisplace in this court that a certain speech now read wasdelivered by him in the house of commons in which amongother matters which he stated respecting the late riot atknightsbridge he said that he had been anxious that acommittee should investigate this question because hewished to let the world know the real character of thisgreat common council who were always meddling with matterswhich they had nothing to do with and which were far abovetheir wisdom and energy it was from such principles theyhad engaged in the recent inquiry which he would contendthey had no right to enter upon not only was evidenceselected but questions were put to draw such answers as theparty putting them desiredthat the conduct of sir william curtis one of the representativesof this city in parliament lias justly meritedthe censure and indignation of this court and of his fellowcitizens after taking a cursory look into the chamberlain's office thecourt of king's bench and common pleas they took their departure fromguildhall very well satisfied with their morning's excursionit was between three and four o'clock when our friends left the halltom shalt being upon the qui vive determined to give his cousin achevy for the remainder of the day and for this purpose it being ona friday he proposed a stroll among the praysellers in smithfieldwhere after partaking of a steak and a bottle at dolly's theyaccordingly repairedyou will recollect said tom that you passed through smithfieldwhich is our principal cattle market during the time of bartholomewfair but you will now find it in a situation so different that youwould scarcely know it for the same place you will now see it fullof horsejockeys publicans pugilists and lads upon the lark likeourselves who having no real business either in the purchase or sale ofthe commodities of the market are watching the manners and manoeuvres ofthose who haveas tom was imparting this piece of information to his attentive cousinthey were entering smithfield by the way of giltspurstreet and weremet by a man having much the appearance of a drover who by the dodgingmovements of his stick directly before their eyes inspired our friendsso strongly with the idea of some animal being behind them which theycould not see and from which danger was to be apprehended that theysuddenly broke from each other and fled forward for safety at whicha roar of laughter ensued from the bystanders who perceivingthe hoax recommended the dandies to take care they did not dirty theirboots or get near the hoofs of the prancing prays tom was not muchdisconcerted at this effort of practical jocularity though his cousinseemed to have but little relish for itcome along said tom catching him by the arm and impelling himforward although this is not bartholomew fair time you must considerall fair at the horsefair unless you are willing to put up with ahorselaughstruggling through crowds who appeared to be buying selling orbargaining for the lame the broken winded and spavined prays ofvarious sizes prices and pretensionsthere is little difference said tom between this place as a marketfor horses and any similar mart in the kingdomhere the friend and the brothermeet to humbug each otherexcept that perhaps a little more refinement on the arts of gullingmay be found and it is no very uncommon thing for a stolen nag tobe offered for sale in this market almost before the knowledge of hisabsence is ascertained by the legal owner i have already given yousome information on the general character of horsedealers during ourvisit to tatters's but every species of trick and low chicanery ispractised of which numerous instances might be produced and though iadmit good horses are sometimes to be purchased here it requires aman to be perfectly upon his guard as to who he deals with and how hedeals although the regulations of the market are generally speakinggoodi wouldn't have him at no price said a costermonger who it appearedwas bargaining for a donkey the h y sulky b won't budgehe's not worth a fig out of a horses i knows better as that are cried a chimneysweeper for no betteran't no yare to be had he's long backed and strong legged here billyou get upon him and give him rump steaks and he'll run like the devilafter a parsonhere bill a little bleareyed chimneysweeper mounted the poor animaland belaboured him most unmercifully without producing any other effectthan kicking up behind and most effectually placing poor bill in the mud to the great discomfiture of the donkey seller and themirth of the spectators the animal brayed the bystanders laughed andthe bargain like poor bill was offafter a complete turn round smithfield hearing occasionally thechaffing of its visitants and once or twice being nearly run overthey took their departure from this scene of bustle bargaining andconfusion taking their way down kingstreet up lowborn hill and alonggreat queenstreetnow said tom we will have a look in at covent garden theatre theexile is produced there with great splendour the piece is certainly gotup in a style of the utmost magnificence and maintains its ground inthe theatre rather upon that score than its really interesting dialoguethough some of the scenes are well worked up and have powerful claimsupon approbation the original has been altered abridged and by sometermed amended in order to introduce a gorgeous coronation a popularspecies of entertainment latelyupon entering the theatre tallyhoho was almost riveted in attentionto the performance and the latter scene closed upon him with all itssplendid pageantry before he discovered that his cousin had given himthe slip and a dashing cyprian of the first order was seated at hiselbow with whom entering into a conversation the minutes were notmeasured till dashall's return who perceiving he was engaged appearedinclined to retire and leave the cooing couple to their apparentlyagreeable teteastute bob however observing him immediately wishedhis fair incognita good night and joined his cousind d dull said tom all weary stale flat and unprofitablebut very grand rejoined bobi have found nothing to look at replied tom i have hunted everypart of the house and only seen two persons i knowand i said tallyhoho have been all the while looking at the piecewhich piece do you mean the one beside you or the one before youthe performance the coronationi have had so much of that said tom that finding you so close inattentionto the stage that i could get no opportunity ofspeaking to you i have been hunting for other game and have almostwearied myself in the pursuit without success so that i am for quittingthe premises and making a call at a once celebrated place near at handwhich used to be called the finish come along therefore unless youhave mettle more attractive perhaps you have some engagementsnone upon earth to supersede the one i have with you was the replyupon which they left the house and soon found themselves in coventgarden market this said tom has been the spot of many larks andsprees of almost all descriptions ana election wit has been as cheapin the market as any of the vegetables of the venders but i am goingto take you to a small house that has in former times been the resort ofthe greatest wits of the age sheridan fox and others of their timehave not disdained to be its inmates nor is it now deserted by thevotaries of genius though considerably altered and conducted inadifferent manner it still however affords much amusement andaccommodation it was formerly well known by the appellation of thefinish and was not opened till a late hour in the night and as atthe present moment is generally shut up between and o'clockand reopened for the accommodation of the market people at in themorning the most respectable persons resident in the neighbourhoodassemble to refresh themselves after the labours of the day with a glassof ale spirits or wine as they draw no porter the landlord is apleasant fellow enough and there is a pretty neat dressing young lassin the bar whom i believe to be his

idare say and after your visit to the woolpack i suppose you can standsmoke if you can't stand fireby this time they had entered the carpenter's arms when turning shortround the bar they found

continued to be thefavorite topic of conversation sir felix expressed his satisfactionthat the worthy citizens of london retained with increasing splendortheir long established renown of preeminent distinction in the art ofgood livingand let us hope said dashall that they will not at any futureperiod be reduced to the lamentable necessity of restraining theprogress of epicurism as in the year when the lord mayor andcommon council enacted a sumptuary law to prevent luxurious eating bywhich it was ordered that the mayor should confine himself to sevenaldermen and sheriffs to six and the swordbearer to four dishesat dinner or supper under the penalty of forty shillings for eachsupernumerary disha law rejoined the baronet which voluptuaries of the presenttimes would find more difficult of observance than any enjoined by thedecaloguethe squire suggested the expediency of a similar enactment with aview to productive results for were the wealthy citizens heobserved prohibited the indulgence of luxurious eating under certainpenalties the produce would be highly beneficial to the civic treasurythe fine arts claiming a priority of notice the party determined onvisiting a few of

thiscountry and are now in the collections of our nobility and gentrychiefly in and about the metropolisalthough france may possess the greatest number of the larger works ofthe old masters yet england undoubtedly possesses the greatest portionof their firstrate productions which is accounted for by the greatpainters exerting all their talents on such pictures as were not toolarge to be actually painted by their own hands while in their largerworks they resorted to inferior assistance pictures therefore of thiskind being extremely valuable and at the same time portable englandduring the convulsions said he thepark at nightfall presented a very sombre aspect being so imperfectlylighted as to encourage the resort of the most depraved characters ofboth sexes and although in several instances a general caption bydirection of the police was made of these nocturnal visitants yetthe evil still remained when a brilliant remedy at last was found byentirely irradiating the darkness hitherto so favourable to the careerof licentiousness these lamps each at a short distance from theother have been lately introduced stretching along the mall andcircumscribing the park they shed a

takecare of yourself and be under no apprehension for me mypeople will never kill me to make you kingin more recent times mr charles townshend used everymorning as he came to the treasury to pass by the canal inthe park and feed the ducks with bread or corn which hebrought in his pocket for that purpose one morning havingcalled his affectionate friends the dickey dickeyduchies he found unfortunately that he had forgotten thempoor duchies he cried i am sorry i am in a hurry andcannot get you some bread but here is sixpence for you tobuy some and threw the ducks a sixpence which one of themgobbled up at the office he very wisely told the story tosome gentlemen with whom he was to dine there being ducksfor dinner one of the gentlemen ordered a sixpence to beput into the body of a duck which he gave charles to cutup our hero surprised at finding a sixpence among theseasoning bade the waiter send up his master whom heloaded with epithets of rascal and scoundrel and sworebitterly

astonished and connecting herideas of the internal show of this palace with its outward appearancedoubted not secretly that it was far inferior to the residence informertimes of her royal progenitorprobably guessing her thoughts dashall proceeded to observe that thepalace was venerable from age and in its interior decoration that itfully corresponded in splendor with the regal purposes

ofher friends during the morning's ramble mentioned that she had a visitto make on an occasion of etiquette and requesting the honour ofthe gentlemen's company to dinner she was handed by the squireof melvillehall with all due gallantry and obeisance into ahackneychariot tom in the meanwhile noting its number in theanticipation of its ultimately proving a requisite precautionthe trio now left to their own pursuits lounged leisurely up stjames'sstreet and pausing at the caricature shop an incident occurredwhich placed in a very favorable point of view the baronet's promptitudeof reply and equanimity of temper having had recourse to his glasseslie stood on the pavement examining the prints unobservant of anyother object when a porter with a load brushed hastily forward andcoming in contact with the baronet put him involuntarily by theviolence of the shock to the left about face without the word eitherof caution or command damn your spectacles at same time exclaimedthe fellow thank you my good friend rejoined sir felix it is notthe first time that my spectacles have saved my eyes remarking on this rencounter dashall observed that theinsolence of these fellows was become really a public nuisance armed inthe panoply of arrogance they assume the right of the footway to theejection danger and frequent injury of other passengers moving in adirect line with loads that

porter the fellowbore on his shoulders a chest of drawers a corner of which while heforced his way along the pavement struck a young lady a stunning blowon the head bringing her violently to the ground and falling against ashop window one of her hands went through a pane of glass by which shewas severely cut thus sustaining a double injury either of which mighthave been attended with fatal consequencesthe three friends had now gained the fashionable lounge of bondstreetwhence turning into conduitstreet they entered limmer's coffeehousefor the purpose of closing by refreshment the morning's excursionhere dashall recognized an old acquaintance in the person of aneminent physician who after an interchange of civilities resumed hisattention to the daily journalsin the same box with this gentleman and directly opposite sat anotherwhose health was apparently on the decline who finding that theingenious physician had occasionally dropped into this coffeehouse hadplaced himself visavis the doctor and made many indirect effortsto withdraw his attention from the newspaper to examine the index of histhe invalid's constitution he at last ventured a bold push at oncein the following terms doctor said he i have for a long timebeen very far from being well and as i belong to an office where i amobliged to attend everyday the complaints i have prove very troublesometo me and i would be glad to remove them the doctor laiddown his paper and regarded his patient with a steady eye while heproceeded i have but little appetite and digest what i eat verypoorly i have a strange swimming in my head c in short aftergiving the doctor a full quarter of an hour's detail of allhis symptoms he concluded the state of his case with a directquestion pray doctor what shall i take the doctor in the actof resuming the newspaper gave him the following laconicprescription take why take advicethis colloquy and its ludicrous result having been perfectly audibleto the company present afforded considerable entertainment of whichthe manoeuvring invalid seemed in no degree willing to partake forhe presently made his exit without even thanking the doctor for hisgratuitous advice limner's hotel this justly esteemed hotel was muchfrequented by the late unfortunate lord camelford enteringthe coffeeroom one evening meanly attired as he oftenwas he sat down to peruse the papers of the day soon aftercame in a dashing fellow a firstrate blood who threwhimself into the opposite seat of the same box with lord cand in a most consequential tone hallowed out waiterbring in a

round into his box lord camelfordhaving finished his paragraph called out in a mimic tone tothat of mr waiter bring me a pair of snuffersthese were quickly brought when his lordship laid down hispaper

away without daring to taste his madeira the repast ended the friends separated sir felix to rejoinhis august relative at their lodgings and arrange with her preparationsfor the entertainment of tom and bob and these two gentlemen alsoreturning homewards to dress for the important occasionpassing the house of his tailor the baronet stept in and desired mrsnip to send to his lodgings any time in the course of the evening forthe last new suit for the purpose of alteration as had been alreadypointed outmiss macgilligan had preceded her nephew in reaching home and gavehim on his arrival an appropriate and edifying lecture on a threefoldsubject embracing petulancy respect to superiors and venerationfor the memory of our ancestorsthe baronet who never designed seriously to insult his aunt but merelyto have a byeblow at her prominent foible pride of descent listenedwith becoming deference to her dissertation which was interruptedby the entrance of his servant the same who on a certainoccasion confided to mother cummings the safety of his master'sproperty the tailor's boy sir felix for the new suit your honorordered to be altered very well rejoined sir felix sure enoughmr snip is prompt in observance of instructions let the lad havethe suit immediately this business having been despatched missmacgilligan was about to resume her admonitory discourse when luckilythe arrival of the expected guests prevented its continuance and it wasconsequently postponed until a more favourable opportunity vide page dinner was shortly announced during which nothing occurred ofparticular import when the exhilarating tuscan grape had supersededthe discarded viands miss macgilligan mentioned that she had beengrossly imposed upon by the driver of the hackneychariot it seemsthat conceiving jehu was exacting more than his fare the ladypresenting a handful of silver told him to take it all if he thoughtproper and the conscientious knight of the whip had actually embracedthe offer in its literal acceptation and pocketing the money made thebest of his way before she recovered from the surprise occasioned bythis iniquitous transaction iniquitous repeated the baronet by the powers of follybut there was no advantage taken at all at all and the man musthave been worse than an idiot had he rejected so liberal an offergramachree he might cry and thanks to the donor such opportunitiesdon't occur every dayappealing to her guests she had the mortification of finding theopinion of her nephew supported certainly madam said dashall theconduct of the man in putting a construction not meant upon your wordwas highly reprehensible yet i am afraid that redress is unavailablea gift was implied though obviously not intended but impartiallyspeaking you tendered a donation and the man if not morally rightwas legally justifiable in accepting itwhile this case was under discussion the baronet chuckled at themischance of his aunt and in defiance of the admonition given him afew hours before seemed more petulant less respectful and totallyirreverent of his ancestorsin the enjoyment of this triumph and asserting that he could not betakenin even by the most artfully conducted manoeuvre he was struckdumb by the information that mr snip the tailor had called for the newsuit the devil fly over the hill of howth with him exclaimed theastounded sir felix with a secret foreboding of evil has he not hadthe new suit hours agohe says not sir answered the servantwhere then in the name of mystery rejoined the baronet are theclothes gone to they were sent by his boy were they nothe denies sir responded the servant that he sent for the clothesat all at allsoul of my grandmother send in this snip of a tailor instantaneouslydashall immediately surmised a fraud and the statement of snipconverted suspicion into factmr snip repeated that he had not sent for the clothes and neitherdid he keep a boy but he recollected that there was a lad in his shoppurchasing some trifling article at the time sir felix gave his addressand ordered the new suit to be sent for and there is no doubt addedsnip that this young adept being thus put in the way of successfullypractising a fraud gladly availed himself of the opportunity andobtained possession of the clothes in my name but sir felix continuedmr snip it must have escaped your recollection when yousanctioned the delivery of the clothes that i had particularlycautioned you when you first honoured me with your custom against yoursending to my house any articles of apparel by pretended messengers fromme unless on the authority of my own hand writingi exonerate you said the baronet from censure and exempt you fromloss i have been swindled there is now no remedy so make me anothersuit

desired that some ladies watches might be brought to hisresidence no southamptonstreet at a certain hour onsaturday for inspection the swindler called some timebefore the jeweller was expected and inquired if the ladieswho were to meet him there had called and being informed inthe negative he affected surprise and desired them to beinformed of his arrival when they came he was shewn intothe front drawingroom but he preferred the adjoining roomand desired the servant to shew a gentleman who would callinto the front room and let him know when he arrived thejeweller was to his time with the goods and mr winter paidhim a visit and after looking over the goods he selectedfour watches worth l to shew the ladies in the nextroom instead of which he took his hat and walked off withthe watches

macgilligan's turn to triumph but to thesurprise and relief of her nephew she did not avail herself of theprivilege sensible perhaps that the loss which site sustained wasoccasioned by her own imprudence and that his misfortune might havehappened to those even the most guarded against deception she consoledinstead of recriminating the most perfect unanimity now prevailedbetween the two relatives and the evening passed on with increasedpleasure the unexpected migration of the new suit led to conversationon the frauds of london when dashall justly observed that if theingenuity

samethe harp opposite drurylane theatre is well known as the resortof theatrical amateurs and professors but those who have not had anopportunity of visiting its interior can scarcely form an idea ofthe mirth wit and humour constantly displayed within its walls thecircumstance here alluded to though not exactly introduced in point oftime is one which generally takes place once in three years viz theelection of a mayor to represent the now city of washington an eventwhich is attended with as much of bustle interest and whimsicalityas a popular election for a member of parliament the generality of thepersons who are frequent visitors to the house are termed harmonious and by due qualification become citizens of washington although wecannot give a true and circumstantial history of this ancient city wedoubt not our numerous readers will discover that its title is derivedfrom an important article in life commonly called lush the four wardsare also appropriately titled as symbolical of the effects which areusually produced by its improper application on entering the roomthe first corner on the right hand is suicide ward and derives itsappellation from a society so named in which each member is bound by anoath that however he might feel inclined to lay violent hands upon hisglass he would not lay violent hands upon his own existence the left hand corner has also a name as appropriate as itsneighbour being called poverty ward so termed from its vicinity tothe door and the ease with which a citizen whose tanner casey andtoggery are out of repair may make his entree and exit withoutsubjecting himself to the embarrassing gaze and scrutiny of his morefortunate fellowcitizens juniper ward which is directly opposite topoverty ward may in a moral point of view be said to mark the naturalgradation rom the one to the other whether these wards are so placedby the moral considerations of the ingenious citizens or not we are atpresent unable to learn but we have discovered that juniper ward isso called in consequence of a club consisting of seven citizens whobound themselves to meet every evening exactly on the spot taking eachupon himself to defray the expense of blue ruin for the whole partyon each evening alternately in the corner directly opposite to suicideward is lunatic ward indicative no doubt of the few steps there arebetween the one and the other hence the four corner pillars of thisancient and honourable city are replete with moral instruction to thewise and discriminating part of society tanner case a pocket toggery cloathingeach of

ingenious artists are selected from the several wards while thecandidates are employed in forming their committees and canvassingtheir friends and fellowcitizens each of them professing an intentionto intersect the city with canals of sky blue to reduce the price ofheavy wet and to cultivate plantations of the weed to be given awayfor the benefit and advantage of the community thereby to rendertaxation useless and the comforts of life compatible by all ranks anddegrees of society to take the burthensome load of civic state uponthemselves in order that their friends and neighbours may be free thatindependence may become universal and that the suffrages of the peoplemay be beyond controul nor can it be doubted but these professionsare made with as much sincerity in many of a similar

bodies of voters werebrought up by canvassing parties from the surrounding habitations withcolours flying and were introduced in succession to poll and as timewas fast escaping every one was active in support of his favouritecandidate all was bustle and anxiety and tom and bob approached thehustings with two chimneysweepers a hackneycoachman and three lightbearers alias linkcarriers from covent garden theatre having polledfor sir william sims who very politely returned thanks for the honour conferred on him standing room was provided for them by theinhabitants of lunatic ward who it should seem like others under theinfluence of the moon have their lucid intervals and who upon thisoccasion displayed a more than usual portion of sanity mingled withgood humour and humanityin this quarter of the city where our friends expected to finddistracted or at least abstracted intellect they were very pleasinglydisappointed at discovering they were associated with reasonable andintelligent beings although some of them fatigued by their exertionsduring the election were so strongly attacked by somnus thatnotwithstanding the bustle with which they were surrounded theyoccasionally dropped into the arms of the drowsy god and accompaniedthe proceedings with a snore till again roused to light and life bysome more wakeful inhabitantat the appointed time the high bailiff announced the election closedand after an examination of the votes declared the choice to havefallen on sir william a circumstance which drew forth a unanimousburst of approbation long loud and deep which in a few

smoke and gas was notworth one puff from his pipe in the midst of this bustle noise and confusion it was sometimebefore the high bailiff could obtain silence when sir williammade his appearance on the hustings and in language well suited for theoccasion declared the heartfelt gratitude he entertained for the highand distinguished honour so handsomely conferred upon him withhis determination never to lose sight of the invaluable rights andprivileges of his constituents assuring them they were welcometo indulge themselves with any thing the house afforded he nextcomplimented his opponents on the very gentlemanlike way in whichthe election had been conducted and alluded most emphatically to theintroduction of those voters who endeavour to lighten the darknessof the world the linkcarriers who by their manners and conduct hadbecome on that occasion as it were links of a chain which in point offriendship good humour and independence he sincerely hoped wouldnever be broken rapturous applause followed this speech whichnotwithstanding the almost overpowering load of gratitude with which thespeaker was burthened was given with good emphasis and correspondingeffectthe other candidates returned thanks to those of their fellowcitizenswho had supported their interest and no one seeming inclined to callfor a scrutiny sir william took the official oath and was investedwith the cloathing of magistracy which being done mr alderman whitmanarose to address the mayorthe well known ability usually displayed by this gentleman hispatriotic zeal and undeviating integrity commanded immediate silencewhile he informed the chief magistrate of a circumstance which hadrecently occurred and which left one of the wards unrepresented by aworthy alderman who in consequence of accepting an office in theboard of controul had by the laws of washington vacated his seat anexplanation being demanded it appeared that the worthy alderman hadbecome a deputy manager of a country theatre and consequently must beconsidered under the board of controul it was therefore necessary heshould at least be reelected before he could be allowed to continue inthe distinguished station of alderman this point being agreed to thesituation was declared vacant and a time appointed for the election the official business of the election being over harmony andconviviality became the order of the night

thegarden and a stroll down drurylane for a walk will do us no harmafter our night's amusement and we can hardly fail to find subjectsworthy of observation though in all probability we are too early torealize all the poet's description of a marketa market's the circle for frolic and gleewhere tastes of all kinds may be suitedthe dasher the quiz and the up to all hepluck sprees from the plants in

that surround the theatres and which of an eveningare thronged with the elegant equipage of the visitors were now filledwith carts waggons and other vehicles of various denominations forconveyance of the marketable commodities to and from the place of salehere and there were groupes of irishmen and basketwomen endeavouringto obtain a load and squabbling with assiduous vociferations for thefirst callthis said tom is the largest market for vegetables we have in themetropolis and supplies numerous retail dealers with their stock intrade who assemble here early in the morning to make their bargainsand get them home before the more important business of the day thatof selling commences while tom was explaining thus briefly to hiscousin aloud laugh attracted their attention and drew them to a partof the market where a crowd was collected to witness a squabble betweena jew orange merchant and a pork butcher although the hon tom dashall hurried his cousin from thescene of altercation at the time of its occurrence theyenjoyed a hearty laugh at the following report of the factswhich appeared in one of the morning papers shortlyafterwardsephraim versus stewartthis was a proceeding in limine by which the plain till'sought reparation for violence done to his religiousscruples and bodily health by the defendant inasmuch as hethe plaintiff being a jew on wednesday the th day ofthis month in the forenoon in the parish of st paulcovent garden did with malice aforethought knock him downwith a pig's head contrary to the statute and against thepeace of our sovereign lord the king cboth plaintiff and defendant pleaded each for himself nocounsel being employed on either sideephraim ephraim deposed that he is by profession an orangemerchantcarrying on his business in covent garden marketthat the defendant richard stewart is a dealer in pork andpoultry in the said market and that he the said richardstewart on the day and time then stated did thrust a pig'sface against his cheek with such violence as to throw himbackwards into a chest of oranges whereby he sustainedgreat damage both in body mind and merchandize plaintiffstated moreover that he had previously and on sundryoccasions forewarned the said richard stewart it wascontrary to the tenets of his religion to come in contactwith pork and yet nevertheless he the said richard didfrequently and from time to time intrude pork upon hisattention by holding it up aloft in the market andexclaiming aloud ephraim will you have a mouthful allthis he humbly submitted betokened great malice andwickedness in the said richard and he therefore besoughtthe magistrate to interpose the protection of the law in hisbehalfthe magistrate observed that he was astonished a person ofmr stewart's appearance and respectability should be guiltyof such conduct and having explained to him that the lawafforded equal protection to the professors of everyreligion called upon him for his defencemay it please your worship said mr richard stewart whois a well fed man of a jolly and pleasing countenancemay it please your worship i keeps a shop in covent gardenmarket and have done so any time these ten years and mrephraim's stand is next to mine now your worship onwednesday morning i'd a hamper o'pork sent up outhertfordshire and so i opened the hamper and at the topof it lay a nice head and i takes it and holds it up andsays i heres a bountiful head says i did ever any body seesuch a handsome un and sure enough your worship it was themost bootiftd as ever was and would a done any body's heartgood to see it it was cut so clean of the quarter drawinghis finger closely across his own neck and was so shorti'the snout and as white as a sheet it was your worshipremarkably handsome and so i said says i look here didever tiny body see such a picture holding it up just inthis manner with that ah says mr ephraim says he nowmy dream's out i dreamt last night that i saw two pig'sheads together and there they are meaning my head andthe pig's head your worship well i took no notice o'thatbut i goes me gently behind him and slides the pig's headby the side of his head claps my own o the other side allon a row with the pig's in the middle your worship andsays i to the folks says i now who'll say which is thehonestest face of the three with that your worship allthe folks fell a laughing and i goes myself quietly backagain to a stall but poor ephraim he fell in such apassion lord lord to see what a pucker he were in hedanced and he capered and he rubbed his whiskers though iverily believe the pig's head never touched him and hejumped and he fidgeted about all as one as if he was madtill at last he tumbled into the orange chest your worshipof his own accord as it were and that's the long and theshort of it your worship as my neighbours here canspecifyhis worship having listened attentively to thoseconflicting statements decided that the defendant had actedindecently in insulting the religious feelings of theplaintiff though at the same time the affair was hardlyworth carrying to the sessions and therefore he wouldrecommend the plaintiff to be satisfied with an apologythe defendant expressed the greatest willingness toapologize for says he i have axed another jew whatcould make mr ephraim in such a passion and he told meyour worship that if you get a rale jew and rub him with abit o'pork it's the greatest crime as ever wasplaintiff and defendant then retired and thematter was compromised the israelite appeared to be in a great rage swore hewould have revenge of his insulting neighbour and pull him up theexasperation of the jew afforded much merriment to the spectators whoseemed to enjoy his aggravation our friends however had arrivedtoo late to discover the cause and although not very particular aboutdiscovering themselves amid the mob conceived it most prudent to moveonward without inquiry for as tom observed if we ask any questionswe are sure to be told lies they then passed through the market madetheir way up jamesstreet to long acre and thence to drurylaneillustration pagejpg drury lanethe watchmen were just leaving their stations with an

and in a short time they entered a sluice in theneighbourhood which enclosed the party from viewturning from the group which they had been paying attention to theywere suddenly attracted by a female purveyor for the stomach who wasserving out her tea coffee and saloop from a boiling cauldron andhanding with due complaisance to her customers bread and butter whichwas as eagerly swallowed and devoured by two duster who appeared torelish their delicate meal with as much of appetite and gout as thepampered palate of a city alderman would a plate of turtle the figureof the lady whose commodities were thus desirable and refreshing to thehungry dustcollectors struck bob at the first view as having somethingmatronly and kind about itthese persons said tom are really useful in their vocation andwhile they provide a wholesome beverage for the industrious are ratherdeserving of approbation than censure or molestation the latterhowever they are frequently subjected to for the kids of lark intheir moments of revelry think lightly of such poor people's stock intrade and consider it a prime spree to upset the whole concernwithout caring who may be scalded by the downfall or how many of theirfellowcreatures may go without a breakfast and dinner in consequencebut do you mark the other woman behind heri do said bob and it is impossible to view them both withoutnoticing the striking contrast they form to each other your observations are just continued tom that is an oldbeldame of the neighbourhood in search of the poor unhappy girl who hasjust taken the irishman in tow an encourager of all that is vicious andbaneful in societyi could almost judge that from her features replied bob though i donot pretend to much skill in physiognomya debauched body and a vitiated mind are perceptible in her face andhaving remained on the town till these were too visible for her to hopefor a continuance she is now a tutoress of others to make the most ofthose with whom they promiscuously associate she furnishes the fineryand shares the plunder it is however a melancholy and disgustingpicture of real life in london and merely deserves to be known in orderto be avoided for there is no species of villainy to which persons ofher stampof whom it is to be hoped there are but few cried tallyhohointerrupting himfor the sake of human nature replied shalt it is to be hoped sobut there is no species of villainy to which they will not stoop the hon tom dashall's observations on this subject arebut too strikingly exemplified by a case heard at worshipstreetpolice office a short time back in which jemimamatthews was charged with conduct which excited astonishmentat the depravity of human nature one of the parishconstables of spitalfields stated he proceeded to theresidence of the prisoner in upper catostreet and foundthe wretch at the bar surrounded by eight children while asupper consisting of a variety of meats and vegetables wasmaking ready on the fire three children frederick clarkjohn clark and john bailey were owned by their parentsthe children seemed so much under the controul of thisinfamous woman that they were afraid to tell the truthuntil she was removed from the bar little bailey then saidthey were daily sent out to steal what they could and bringit home in the evening when they could get nothing elsethey stole meat from the butchers and vegetables from thegreengrocers the woman kept a pack of cards by which shetold their fortunes whether they would succeed or becaught by the officers mr sway observed that since hehad attended the office he never witnessed a case of somuch iniquity the prisoner was remanded for furtherexamination and the magistrate intimated he should desirethe parish to prosecute her for the misdemeanor in excitingthese children to commit felonies at this moment their attention was suddenly called to anothersubject by a loud huzza from a combination of voices at no greatdistance from where they then were and in a few minutes a considerableconcourse of duster and others appeared in viewthere is something in the wind said dashall we must have a look atthese gentry for there is frequently some humour among themi hope replied bob they have not overturned the dustcart in thewind for i am apprehensive in such a case we should scarcely have eyesto view their frolicstom laughed at the ready turn of his cousin and remarking that allflesh was dust proceeded towards the increasing party here they soonfound out that as a venerable son of the fantailedhat fraternitydescribed it a screw was looseperhaps inquired bob it is the inchpin why aye mayhap as howthat there may be the case for aught i knows about it howsomever i'lltell you all about it first and foremost you must know that dick nobslives down here in charlesstreet and dick nobs has got a wife nowshe is the devil's own darling and dick is a match for her or the devilhimself come from wherever he may but as good a fellow as ever lappedup a pail full of watergruel and so you must know as how dick has thishere very morning been found out in bed with another man's wife theother man is a nightman and rubbishcarter what lives in the samehouse with dick so this here man being out all night at a job dickgets lusty and so help me he finds his way steady enough intothat there man's bed and when that there man comes home my eyes what ablow up there lays dick nobs fast asleep in the man's wife's arms sohe kicks up a row dick shews fight and the man comes and tells us allabout it so we are going to try him for a misdemeanor and he can'thelp himself no how whatsomedevertom was alive to the story and in a few minutes the culprit wasconducted to a neighbouring publichouse tried before a whole bench ofthe society cast and condemned to undergo the usual sentence insuch cases made and provided entitled burning shame and activepreparations were making by those of the fraternity without to carryinto immediate execution the sentence pronounced by those within the offender was decorated with a bunch of christmas in hishat and two large carrots in the front to represent horns in thismanner he was mounted on the brawny shoulders of four of his companionspreceded by the crier of the court another fustian with a bell whichhe rung lustily and at intervals proclaimed the crime of which theculprit had been found guilty after the crier followed eight moreof the brotherhood two and two their hats ornamented with bunchesof holly and a burning candle in the front of each hat then came theculprit carried as already described with a pot of heavy wet in onehand and a pipe of tobacco in the other which he occasionally smoakedstooping forward to light it at one of the candles in the fantail hatsof his two front supporters the rear of this ludicrous procession wasbrought up by several other duster and coalheavers and their ladiesthe procession set out from charlesstreet down drurylane greatqueenstreet wildstreet and round clare market followed by animmense crowd which kept increasing as they went and nearly renderedthe streets impassable two collectors were appointed one on each sideof the street and were very active in levying contributions amongthe spectators to defray the expenses they stopped at severalpublichouses where they quaffed off oceans of heavy wet and numerousstreamlets of old jamaica and then returned to headquarters incharlesstreet where the offence was drowned in drink and they andtheir ladies passed the remainder of the evening as happy as beer andgin rum and tobacco could make themhaving witnessed a considerable part of this ceremonious proceedingand been informed of the intended finale our friends who began tofeel somewhat uncomfortable for want of refreshment and rest proposedreturning home and having thrown themselves into a hack they in ashort time arrived at piccadillychapter xixif in real life's chapter you e'er tinct a blanktis yourself and you only you justly can thankfor to him who is willing there's no need to standsince enough may be found twixt mile end and the strandto instruct to inform to disgust or inviteto deplore to respect to regret

avoid the latter you're pronetis at least quite as well where they are should be known the arrival at piccadilly turned out to be truly agreeableto our friends who were scarcely dressed and seated at thebreakfasttable before they were surprised by the unexpected appearanceof an old friend whose company and conversation had upon many occasionsafforded them so much pleasure and information this was no other thansparklemy dear boy said the hon tom dashall you are welcome to the sceneof former gratifications how is your better half and all friends inthe country any increase in the family why you look as healthy ashygeia and as steady as old timei confess replied sparkle you ask so many questions upon importantsubjects in one breath that i am quite deficient of wind to answer themseriatim you must therefore take an answer in two words all's rightenough replied tom then i am content but how what are you intown aloneyou shall know all in time but don't drive on too hard i am glad tomeet you again in the regions of fun frolic and humour of which idoubt not there is as there always was a plentiful stock glad to seeyou both in good health and tiptop spirits i have only come to passafortnight with you and as i intend to make the utmost use of everyminute of the time don't let us waste in empty words what would bebetter employed in useful deeds useful deeds reechoed tom useful deeds that savours ofreflection i thought you were fully aware it is an article consideredof little value in the labyrinths of london but since you are becomeas i may venture to presume a useful man what may be the objects uponwhich you propose to practise your utilitystill the same i find tom all life spirit and gaiety nothing likea hit and i suppose you now think you have a palpable one never mindi am not easily disconcerted therefore you may play off the artilleryof your wit without much chance of obtaining a triumph but however inplain words i expect to be a happy father in about another montho ho said tom then you are really a useful member of society andi suppose are merely come up to town for the purpose of picking up alittle more useful information and instruction how to perform the partof papanay replied sparkle i could hardly expect to obtain such from youi must therefore be excused and acquitted of all such intentions butjoking apart how are you devotedto you replied tallyhoho who was much pleased by this accession totheir societythen continued sparkle lend me all the assistance in your powerwhen did you see our old friend merrywellthe last time i saw him was in a place of safety studying the law andtaking lessons from its professors in the priorywe must find him replied sparkle so if you are not engaged comealong and i will relate the circumstances which induce this search aswe proceedto this proposal tom and bob readily acceding the party were quickly ontheir way towards abbot's park you must know said sparkle that merry well's uncle inthe country having received some information upon the subject of hisconfinement probably very highly coloured has since his releasewithdrawn his patronage and support so that the poor fellow has beenwithout supplies for some time past and i am at a loss to conjectureby what means he is now working the oracle for a subsistence his unclehowever is in the last stage of a severe illness with little chanceof recovery and as i apprehend there is but little time to spare iintend if possible to find our old acquaintance start him for hisrelative's residence in hope that he may arrive in time to be in at thedeath and become inheritor of his estate which is considerable andmay otherwise be apportioned among persons for whom he has had butlittle or no regard while livingthe object in view is a good one said dashall and i sincerely hopewe shall succeed in our endeavourspassing down st james'sstreet sparkle was quickly recognized by manyof his old acquaintances and friends and congratulated upon his returnto the scenes where they had in company with him enjoyed many a larkand invitations came in as fast upon nim as the moments of life werefleeting away for the present however all engagements weredeclined till the principal object of his journey to london should beaccomplished and after inquiries about old friends and observationsupon the passing occurrences of the moment were over they proceeded ontheir way westminster bridge was the precise line of direction for themto pursue and as fortune would have it they had scarcely arrived atthe foot of it before they discovered merrywell bustling along inan opposite direction he however appeared rather inclined to passwithout recognition or acknowledgment when sparkle turning close uponhim gave him a hearty tap on the shoulder which made him as it wereinvoluntarily turn his headwell met said sparkle i want youat whose suit sir was the immediate inquiryto suit yourself was a reply as quickly givenzounds said merrywell i had little idea of being tapped on theshoulder by an old friend but are you indeed in earnestcertainly i am and can't be refused but if you should be pinchedfor bail i think i have two friends with me who will do the needfulintroducing tom and bobi see how it is continued merrywell and have no objection to ajoke but i can't bear to have it carried too far how d'ye do howd'ye do can't stop in a devil of a hurry full of business zounds said tom you are almost as bad as the man whohaving married a wife could not come but if i may be so bold whitheraway so fastto westminster hall the sessions is on must go law is like the tideit stays for none adieuwe cannot part thus said sparkle i have come some miles in searchof you and cannot afford to be played with nowthen accompany me to westminster hall and i will be at your serviceif not replied sparkle i shall enter a special detainer againstyou so come alongthey now entered westminster hall where merry well having disposed ofsome briefs and other papers into the hands of a counsellor preparatoryto a cause coming onthere continued he now i am at your servicethen tell me said sparkle what you are atfirst inquired merry well let me know what is your object in askingsuch a questionthis being briefly explained together with the absolute necessity therewas for his leaving town without delaynow said he i am at liberty to give you a sketch of circumstanceswhich have befallen me since i saw you lastcome then said dashall we will proceed to piccadilly spend acomfortable afternoon and ship you off by the mail from the white horsecellar at eight o'clockwith all my heart was the reply well now you must understand i amasort of dabbler in professions i was liberated from the high wallof the priory by the insolvent debtor's act and since the unfortunaterepresentation to the old boy which deprived me of the needfulsupplies i have tried my hand in three different waysand which are theylove law and literature continued merry wella very pretty combination said dashall and are you able to makethem blend comfortably together nothing more easy in the world in the first place a lady hastaken a fancy to me which fancy i am willing to indulge in return forwhich she provides me with every indulgence i profess to be principalin the office of a lawyer of established practice who suffers me toshare in the profits of such business as i can obtain in the way ofliterature i have as yet done but little though i am encouraged to hopemuch from the success of others indeed i am told if i can but writelibels for john bull i may make a rapid fortuneand when so made said sparkle i shall wish you well with it but ithink the speculation i have already named much more likely to turn outequal to your wishes and more consonant with your feelings than thepursuit of either of those you have mentionedthere i agree perfectly with you and if i can make all right with theold gentleman a fig for all the rest of my occupations but you know ialways liked independence and if i could not get a fortune ready madei had a desire to be the architect of one i should raise for myselfwhy i know you have generally borne the character of a man of geniusyes and a deal my character did for me after quitting the walls whyman i happened to hear of a vacancy in a city parish school for whichi ventured to conceive myself duly qualified and therefore determinedto make application to the churchwardens one of whom had the characterof being a man of great power and was said to be the first in his linein the three kingdoms away i posted full of hope and expectationof becoming a second caleb quoted not doubting but salary andcircumstances would turn out exactly to my wishbut i thought you liked independence said tallyhohorather too much to engage in that concern was the reply as you willhear presently upon tracing out this gentleman who bore so strong arecommendation to particular notice you may guess my surprise uponfinding purveyor of sausages in gold letters over his doordashall burst into an irresistible laugh and was most cordially joinedby sparkle and tallyhoho who were now strongly interested in the resultof merrywell's accountwhen i arrived continued merry well this patron was reading thenewspaper which he threw down immediately upon my entrance havingmistaken me for a customer servant sir said he pulling down his greasywaistcoat i am come sir said i to make some inquiryconcerning a vacant schoolmastership oh there again resumed thesausagemaking churchwarden vy you are the seventeenth fellow thathas been here today a bothering me about this plaguy vacancy how doyou read you'll have a trial before me and my brother representative ofthis parish and my spouse will also attend the reading bouts now ifso be as you minds your hits why then may be you'll be the domini butmind you i don't like your sonorous voices and my spouse she knowsthings quite as well as i do she wants a great deal of action soonly you mind loud and sonorous and plenty of muscular motion for myspouse that's the way to win but i haven't any time to talk to younow you must call of an evening when i am more at leisure and theni'll explain so move off now sir move off for i sees a customercoming servant maun flesh and blood could bear no more andso so what said sparkle did you knock him down in the midstof his own sausagesno no i knew too much of the law for that but i cut thechurchwarden and bolted from the sausageshop determined to embracelaw physic or divinity in preference to cuttingthe rumpsof little schoolboy jackiethe study of the law was rather compulsory than voluntary for duringmy residence in the college i was under the necessity of devoting somepart of my time to though i felt no great partiality for it and youknow law is law and as in such and so forth and hereby and aforesaidprovided always nevertheless notwithstanding law is like a countrydance people are led up and down in it till they are tired law is likea book of surgery there are a great many terrible cases in it it isalso like physic they that take least of it are best off law is likea homely gentlewoman very well to follow law is like a scolding wifevery bad when it follows us law is like a new fashion people arebewitched to get into it it is also like bad weather most people areglad when they get out of it i believe that sincerely cried the hon tom dashall for ithink there are instances enough in which law has nothing at all to dowith justice this remark of the hon tom dashall is admirablyillustrated by the following statementtwelve people in one bail bond fob ten pounds thereare very few instances of delinquency which we havestated that will stagger the belief of the fairpractitioner because they know such transactions arepossible their only surprise is the impunity with whichthey are committed mixed with some regret that theprofession is so contaminated the species of peculationwe have now to submit to our readers is of singular naturefor we know not whether folly impudence or infamy has thegreater share in the transaction we will therefore leaveour readers to judge as to the statement of the fact itis impossible we can err as we were concerned for thedefendants and the case singular as it is was literallyand accurately thus one of those unfortunate females whocontribute to the existence of a miscreant crew of bawdsmilliners hairdressers tallywomen and many otherreptiles of the same class was arrested for ten pounds atthe house of the celebrated or more properly speakingthe notorious mrs johnson of jermynstreet theattorney accompanied the officer and it happened that ayoung gentleman connected with a bankinghouse of greatrespectability was present whom the attorney directed totake in a bail bond with the ladyabbess herself but asthey were not sufficiently responsible ten more of thecyprian tribe all nuns of the same convent were likewiserequired to execute this bond of course they compliedthe attorney after having made the parties acquaintedwith the great favour he had shewn them and the vastresponsibility he had taken upon himself required no morethan two guineas for the officer and himself telling themhe would give them information when any thing further was tobe done instead of which he took an assignment sued outprocess prepared declarations and served the partiesthe gentleman rather alarmed at the idea of thecircumstance being known desired us to pay the debt andcosts for that purpose we applied to the attorney and toour astonishment we were informed that the costs amounted tothirty pounds for that there were twelve defendants thereader cannot suppose that any thing further could pass uponsuch a preposterous subject than giving notice of anapplication to the court to set aside the proceedings onour return home we found eleven of the defendantsconsisting of the old brood hen and her chickens each witha copy of the process in her hand the business now mostcertainly put on the appearance of some costs we againapplied to the attorney and by way of cutting it shortoffered him five pounds but he like many others who relyon the integrity and propriety of their practice disdaineda compromise or abridgement of his lawful fees and he washardy enough to suffer the application it is almostneedless to say the proceedings were set aside we haveforebode to mention the name of the attorney on account ofthe misery in which this dreadful transaction has involvedhim a misery which amply atones for his offences anddeprives him of the power of ever offending again as anattorney far be it from us then to sink him deeper in thegulph of wretchedness we kick not the dead lion it isathletic triumphant villany against which we wage war by this time they were arrived in piccadilly where they satdown to a cheerful refreshment and proceeded to make arrangementsfor merry well's departure previous to this however dashall and hiscousin had an engagement to keep with their hibernian friends of whichparticulars will appear in the next chapterchapter xxall hail to the day of the tutelar

announcementof festivity and joining sir felix o'o'grady and his aunt at theirlodgings the party immediately moved onward to the scene of actionalready had royalty taken wing and dignified with his presence the latematernal palace before our pedestrians reached the park to the greatdisappointment of miss macgilligan who however consoled herself withthe hope of being able to obtain a glimpse of monarchy as his majestypassed on his return to carltonhousethe baronet in the meanwhile was in a reverie which at last broke outin the following rhapsodyoh blest occasion of dispensing goodhow seldom

i say again i pity kings an immense number of splendid carriages now presentedthemselves to view in continued and uninterrupted successionstretching from the horse guards the whole length of the mall tobuckinghamhouse where each setting down and thence taking up aposition in the birdcage walk they formed a circle of nearly twomiles and exhibited in the magnificence of the vehicles the admirablesymmetry of the horses and rich liveries of the attendants a scene ofinterest matchless perhaps by any other metropolis in the universeskirting the indeterminable line of carriages that slowly and underfrequent stoppages proceeded to the goal of attraction our partypenetrated at last the dense mass of spectators and gaininga favourable post of observation took a position adjacent tobuckinghamhouse where the band of music of the foot guards withinand that of the horse guards without the ironrailing circumscribing thepalace alternately enlivened the scene with concord of sweet soundsbut the great and general object of attention was that of femaleloveliness occupying almost every passing vehicle dashall remarkedthat he had never before been gratified with such an extensive andcaptivating display sir felix and the squire were in raptures and eventhe primitive austerity of miss macgilligan yielded to the influence ofbeauty and acknowledging its predominancy she at same time observedthat its fascination was enhanced by the dress of the ladies whichthough splendid exhibited genuine taste and was more remarkable forits uniform adherence to modesty than she had hitherto seen it on anysimilar occasionally we are not fastidious neither would we wish the charms ofyouth and beauty inaccessible to admiration but certainlythe dress or rather undress of our fair countrywomen hasof late years bordered closely on nudity female delicacyis powerfully attractive we were glad to observe itspredominancy at the last levee and we trust that it willgain universal prevalence edit dashall whose place would more properly have been in thecircle within the palace than amongst the spectators without wasfrequently saluted by the passing company and when the fair handof beauty waved gracefully towards him sir felix felt happy inthe friendship and society of a gentleman thus honoured with suchdistinguished recognition and in the warmth of his feelings exclaimedaloud that by the immortal powers were he king of england he wouldbe more proud of the irradiating charms of these celestial visitorsthan in the diadem of royalty and extension of empire this remark wasuniversally acquiesced in and most cordially so by a group of livelygirls to whom it had apparently given much pleasure one of whomthanked the baronet in the name of the sex and complimented him on hisgallantry which she said was truly characteristic of his countryto sir felix an encomium from a fair lady was ever irresistiblehe bowed expressed a commensurate feeling of gratitude for the honourconferred upon him and professed himself an ardent admirer of the wholeof women kind concluding by humming a stanza from burnsauld nature swears the lovely dearsher noblest work she classes oher

two rival female fruiterers of the emerald isle during whichincivilities were exchanged in language not altogether acceptable to theauricular organs of delicacy the brogue was that of munster thewar of words waged quicker and faster and from invective the heroinesseemed rapidly approximating to actual battle neither parkkeeper norconstable were at hand and although the surrounding mobility laughedat the tumult and enjoyed the storm sir felix much distressed atso untoward an incident and deeply interested in the honour of hiscountry so lately the theme of elegant panegyric dashed through thecrowd the component parts of which he scattered aside like chaff andarrested the further progress of the wranglersarrah now for the honour of munster be any ye brats of the devil'sown begettinghear

initiated of chesterfield obtain admission intopolished society although the principles of politenessinculcated by that nobleman contain as a celebratedlexicographer said of them the morals of a whe and themanners of a dancingmasterthe party having lounged away another pleasant hour made ultimatelytheir exit from the park by the stableyard and entering pall mallwere agreeably surprised with a very interesting exhibitionduring many years of the late king's reign it was usual on thebirthday anniversary for the different mail coaches to pass in reviewbefore his majesty in front of st james's palace the custom stillprevailson the present occasion numerous spectators had assembled opposite carltonhouse and it is presumed that the sovereign thence witnessed theprocession although he was not within the view of public observation above thirty mail coaches fresh gilt and painted or inthe language of churchwardens beautified and each drawn by fournoblespirited yet perfectly tractable horses elegantly caparisonednow made their appearance the cavalcade moved slowly onward theprancing steeds impatient of restraint and conscious of superiorityon the box of each vehicle was seated a portly good looking manthe knowing jehu of the road and behind was the guard occasionallywinding his buglehorn with melodious and scientific ability thereins and harness were new so also were the royal liveries of thecoachmen and guards mounted conductors led the van of the processionwhile others accompanied it on either side and the interest of thescene was considerably heightened by each coach being occupied insideby handsome welldressed women and children the rear of this imposingspectacle was brought up by a long train of the twopenny postboys allnewly clothed in the royal uniform and mounted on hardy ponies chieflyof the highland and shetland breed the cavalcade halted in front of theroyal residence and gave three cheers in honour of the day whichwere heartily returned by the populace the procession then resumed itsprogress by charingcross the strand fleetstreet ludgatehill roundst paul's and by cheapside into lombardstreetpassing up the new street the associates reached the mansion ofdashall who had previously engaged his friends to dinneran elegant repast was immediately served up and highly enjoyed by theparty after such prolonged exercise and abstinencethe conversation turning on the recent interesting exhibition it wasuniversally acknowledged that the introduction of the mail coach intothe establishment of the general postoffice might be classed among thehighest improvements of the age as amazingly accelerating thecelerity of intercourse with all parts of the empire neither wasthe wellmerited meed of encomium withheld from the twopennypostinstitution by which so frequently in the course of the day thefacility of communication is kept up within the metropolis and suburbsextending to all decencies and bounded only by the limits of thebills of mortality dashall who seldom let slip an opportunity ofappropriate remark digressed from the procession to theimportant national utility of the postoffice and thence by easytransition to the sublime powers of the human mind as emphaticallyexemplified in the invention of writing and printing while sir felixwho was well experienced in the british poets favoured his aunt with aquotation from pope's epistle of heroism to abelard subject howeverto such whimsical interpolation as he deemed suitable to the occasionheaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid some antiquelovesick north of ireland maid they live they speak they breathewhat age inspires preposterous fondness and impure desires the latentwish without a blush impart reveal the frailties of a morbid heartspeed the neglected sigh from soul to soul and waft a groan from industo the polethe reading of miss macgilligan like her ideas was rather on acontracted scale she suspected however that her nephew had aimedagainst her the shafts of ridicule and was preparing her resentmentaccordingly when the baronet deprecating her wrath assured her thathe had recited the lines exactly as originally written and that in thepresent clay they had no personal application having been composed bya little cynical fellow many years before miss macgilligan came intoexistence the lady gave credence to the assertion and the impendingstorm was happily avertedthe residence of royalty being within the precinct of st james's thebells of the neighbouring church sounded a merry peal in the ears ofthe party and were responded to by those of st martininthefieldsa parish of which it is remarkable that his majesty george ii was oncechurchwarden serving the office of course by deputy the steepleof this church as well as those of many others in the metropolisdisplayed throughout the day the royal standard a manifestation ofloyalty which likewise extended itself to the liquid element of oldfather thames where many of the vessels commemorated the anniversary byfrequent salutes of artillery under the decorative and splendid canopyformed by the colours of all nations the carriages of the foreign ambassadors and those of thefriends of government were again in requisition and rattled along thestreets towards the several mansions of the members of administrationwho each in conformity with ancient usage gave a grand dinner on thebirthday at least on that appointed for its celebrationat these dinners said dashall politics and etiquette are both laidaside conviviality is the order of the day the glass the jokethe repartee and the retort courteous circulate freely and all isharmony and good humourwith sometimes a sprinkling of alloy said the squire i have heardthat during the administration of mr pitt he and the lord chancellorthrow were frequently at variance on subjects having no reference topolitics and even under the exhilarating influence of the grapethe party were all attention and the squire proceeded at a cabinetdinner a discussion took place between the premier and lord chancelloras to the comparative merits of the latin and english languages mrpitt gave the preference to the former the chancellor to thelatter and the arguments on both sides were carried on with equalpertinacity the premier would not yield a jot in opinion becoming atlast impatient of oppositionwhy said he the english language is an ambiguity twonegatives make an affirmative but in the latin two negatives make apositive then said the chancellor your father and mother musthave been two negatives to make such a positive fellow as you are lord chancellor throw although a very eccentriccharacter was yet a man of uncommon benevolence a vacancyhaving occurred in a valuable living of which he had thepresentation numerous were the candidates for the beneficeand amongst others one recommended by several of thenobility friends of the ministry who made himself sure ofthe appointment although directly or indirectly thechancellor had not given any promise in the meanwhile itwas one morning announced to his lordship that a gentlemanapparently a clergyman waited the honour of an interviewthe servant was ordered to shew the stranger into thelibrary whither the chancellor shortly repaired andinquired the object of the visit my lord said theother i served the office of curate under the deceasedrector and understanding that the presentation is in yourlordship's gift you want the living exclaimed thechancellor gruffly no my lord my humble pretensionssoar not so high but i presume most respectfully toentreat your lordship's influence with the new incumbentthat i may be continued in the curacy surprised andpleased by the singular modesty of the applicant who hadserved the same parish as curate above twenty years and nowproduced the most ample testimonials of character hislordship entered into conversation with him and found himof extensive erudition and orthodox principles heascertained besides that this poor curate had a wife withsix children entirely dependent on his exertions forsupport and that the remuneration allowed for the faithfuldischarge of arduous duties had been only thirty pounds perannum the chancellor now promised his influence in behalfof the curate with the person who probably might succeed tothe living i shall see him added his lordship thisvery day attend me tomorrow and you shall know theresult the curate took his leave and in the course of themorning the wouldbe rector made his appearance oexclaimed his lordship entering directly into the businessi have had a humble suitor with me today the curate ofthe late incumbent whom you are desirous of succeeding hewishes to continue in the curacy the poor man is burthenedwith a large family and hitherto has been very inadequatelyrewarded for his labour in the productive vineyard of whichyou anticipate the possession and emolument suppose thatyou constitute the happiness of this worthy man by givinghim a salary of one hundred pounds per annum he will haveall the duties to perform and you will pocket a surpluseven then of seven hundred a year for in fact doingnothing this wouldbe was astonished he had never beforeheard of a curate in the receipt of one hundred pounds perannum besides he had already engaged a person to do theduty for twentyfive pounds fired with indignation at theinhumanity and arrogant presumption of this callousheartedclergyman what exclaimed his lordship and so youwould turn the poor curate out of doors and abridge themiserable pittance of his successor and all this beforeyou've got the living john shew this fellmo down stairsgladly would this incumbent by anticipation have concededevery point required but it was too late the die was castand he found himself in the street unknowing how he gotthere whether on his hands or his lucas next day thecurate was announced i have not been able to succeedsaid his lordship the new incumbent has engaged a personwho will do the duty for twentyfive pounds per annum hislordship paused and the unfortunate curate looked thepersonification of despondency cheer up man exclaimedhis lordship if i have not influence sufficient tocontinue you in possession of the curacy i can at leastgive you the living putting into the hands at the sametime of the amazed curate the presentation to a rectoryworth eight hundred pounds per annum here we must draw thegrecian painter's veil the gratification on either sidemay be conceived but cannot be expressed sir felix laughed heartily at this anecdote and inquired ofhis aunt whether she knew any of the positive family in the north ofirelandperfectly well retorted the lady they are allied to theroundheads of the province of munsterthis reproof which was hailed with applause by tom and bobdumbfoundered the baronet who became suddenly taciturn but hishabitual good humour predominated and conscious that he had broughton himself the inflicted castigation he resolved on a cessation ofhostilities for the remainder of the eveningthe invitation by dashall having been without formal ceremony andunhesitatingly accepted by miss macgilligan and her nephew they now inturn claimed the like privilege of freedom by soliciting the companyof the two cousins to supper a request which tom and bob cheerfullyacquiesced in and the party immediately set out for the baronet'slodgings preferring to walk the short distance that they might viewmore leisurely the accustomed illuminations on the anniversary of hismajesty's birthdaythe variegated lamps were tastefully arranged but this effusion ofloyalty was rather of an interested than interesting description beingconfined wholly to the publicoffices the theatres and the differenthouses of his majesty's tradesmen no other habitation in this immensemetropolis bearing any external indication of attachment on the part ofits occupant to the sovereign of the british empirehere comes a set of jolly fellows exclaimed the baronet as the partyof friends turned into bowstreet from coventgarden who are at leastdetermined to honour the anniversary of st george and their sovereignthe clang of marrow bones and cleavers resounding with harsh andstunning dissonancerather said dashall fellows determined to levy contributions on thepublic caring as little for the actual george the king as they do forthe fabulous george the championnow loud and yet louder the grating din grewand near and more near still the butchergang drewrapacious obstreperous a turbulent setand bent on annoyance of all whom they met it was in vain that our party attempted to avoid them bycrossing the street the intention was quickly thwarted by theseselflicensed prowlers who intercepting our associates in thecarriageway encircled them in such a manner as to preclude thepossibility of extrication and raised at the same time a discoidof sounds compared with which the vocal minstrelsy of the longearedbraying fraternity would have been the music of the spheressir felix in chastisement of their arrogance would singly haveencountered the whole group had he not been restrained by tom and bobwho rather than engage in a street brawl with a host of pertinaciousadversaries chose to yield to circumstances and purchase freedomat the expense of a trifling pecuniary consideration with which thecollectors departed well satisfiedour observers having thus obtained their liberty renewed their walkand reached the lodgings of the baronet without farther interruptionduring their perambulation the following article was put into the handsof the squire with which we shall conclude our chapter of incidentsthe king and the laureata loyal birthday effusionhail mighty monarch of a mighty

and everlasting supply of humour andeccentricity for an observant quiz like yourself and being fly to mostoccurrences either in town or country i shall rather confine myself tothe most remarkable circumstances that happen to strike my recollectionus we proceed the first that occurs at this moment is the opening of anew establishment in regentstreet under the title of the cafe royaleto which as we have not yet paid a visit i propose now to direct yourstepscafe royale repeated sparkle there is something frenchified in thesound i suppose it is quite in the tip top stile of eleganceso says reportthen allons but as we proceed i beg to ask one question if itbe considered important in a national point of view that the superiorelegancies of our parisian neighbours should be engrafted on our ownhabits and that an establishment of this nature should be formed witha view of its becoming the resort of rank and fashion whether any goodreason can be given why such an establishment in an english city forenglishmen should not have an english titlea most extraordinary question for a fashionable manit may be so continued sparkle but you must attribute it to mycountry habits of thinking however as i like argument better thanassertion i see no reason to abandon my question the adoption ofany thing foreign is only rational in proportion as it is useful oragreeable for foreign wines foreign fruits foreign made coffee cno one can be a greater advocate than myself but i apprehend that thesegood things may taste as well whether the room in which they are takenbe called by a french or an english namethat is a truth so self evident as to require no reply and really ican give no sort of reason for the adoption of a french title unlessit be with a view to give it that air of novelty which invariably provesattractive to johnny bull and i think i need not attempt to explain toyou the importance of a titlehowever said sparkle i cannot help thinking that if the placealluded to is to become a permanent establishment it would become anenglishman to have an english name for it we need not be ashamed of ourlanguage although some folks disdain to use it if they can findany substitute however inapt why should it not be called the royalcoffeehouse the king's coffeehouse the patrician the universal orinfact any thing so that it be english because said tallyhoho those titles are already engrossedby newspaper editors coffeeshops of a lower order magazines cfor instance we have the royal magazine the universal magazineand consequently these are all grown common and any thing common isextremely vulgarbesides continued dashall cafe royale is a mouthful withoutattacking its contents and the very sound of it seems to impart ataste before you approach it of what may be obtained in the interiorzounds this country life of your's seems to have altered your opinionsand almost obliterated your former education i never had any relish foritin town let me live and in town let me die for in truth can'trelish the country not i if one must have a villa in summer to dwelloh give me the sweet shady side of pall mallby this time they had reached the cafe royale and upon entrance wereushered by a man in blue livery with gold laced trimmings into anapartment far exceeding in splendour any thing that their previousconversation had led them to expect the walls formed of looking glassand rich tapestry and ornamented in a fanciful manner reflected theirpersons as they passed along at every point while the choicest flowersand shrubs with which they were surrounded sent forth a delightfulfragrance and gave some distant idea of eastern luxurieshere said the hon tom dashall is elegance at least and ifthe accommodations are found to be equally good it can be of littleconsequence to us whether the place itself have an english or a foreignnamei confess replied sparkle that i still conceive that as a placeof resort appropriated to the upper ranks of natives and foreignersmagnificent in its decorations superior in its accommodations andconducted with skill and liberality to become truly national anddeserving of support it should be honoured with an english titleand that it certainly is continued dashall not only one but manyfor nobility is frequently to be found within its walls nay a proof ofit appears at this moment for there is lord p and lord c nowentering but come let us try the coffee catch a view of the papersand proceed they had now seated themselves near an elderly gentleman whoseemed to be in deep contemplation occasionally rubbing his hands withapparent gratification and shaking his head with importance while heglanced over a newspaper which lay before himi should judge said tallyhoho he is a member of parliamentprobably conning over the report of his last night's speech in thehouseor probably said dashall an author in search of ideas for hisnext publication wherein he intends to cut up the ministers and theirmeasuresyes continued sparkle or a quack doctor examining if the editorhas given insertion to his new flaming advertisement wherein hepromises to perform what is utterly impossible to be accomplishedi wonder if he can speak said tom laying clown the paper i'll tryhim a fine morning siras this was directed immediately to meet the old gentleman's ear helooked up for the first time since they had enteredbeautiful sir was the reply and here the conversation ceased againexcellent coffee said sparkle is there any news today sirendeavouring to rouse him againthere is always news sir was the reply taking a plentiful supply ofsnuffof one sort or other continued bonwhy yes have we not every day a quantity of newspapers that make theirappearance with the suntruly replied sparkle but you could hardly misunderstand me ialluded to something out of the common run of events such forinstance as relates to the interests of the nation the agriculturaldistress the distress of the irish the state of the americanindependents the proceedings of the spanish cortes and the frenchchamber the movements of the greeks the operations of turkey andrussia or the or why sir your inquiries are very rational and as i perceive you havea desire for intelligence and i have at all times a desire to impartsuch as i am in possession of for the benefit of others the newspapershave abundance of information but i must say the editors though men ofeducation and intelligence are not always well informed besides sirthere is no reliance on their assertions many valuable and importantsecrets are in the hands of individuals which never find their way intothe public journals having proceeded thus far our three friends were allanxiety to continue what now assumed the appearance of an interestingconversationthe nation is gull'd by misrepresentation from the high to the low onesystem is acted upon but i have a document in my pocket which came intomy possession in rather an extraordinary manner and is as extraordinaryin its contents it was thrust into my hand on my way here by astranger who instantly disappeareda curious salute observed tom probably some state paper someinformation on foreign affairs or a petition to be presented to thehousethe fact is sir as i had no conversation with the stranger i wasignorant of the importance of the document but upon opening it judgeof my astonishment when i found it concerned a prince well known to thebritish nation whose interests depend on its supporto ho said sparkle then perhaps it is of a delicate nature and moreattaching to private circumstances than public affairsyou shall hear sir it was an appeal to myself amongst others inwhich russia was stated to be in such connection with greece thatthe heads of this kingdom could not but be conscious of the importantresults results sir that were enough to make one's hair stand on endindeed i have never been able to dismiss the subject from my mind sincei first cast my eye over the informationzounds then cried dashall there is much to be apprehendedit is impossible for me continued the old gentleman to say howfar the distinguished person to whom i have alluded has already ormay hereafter succeed in the objects he has in view but this i thinkcertain that if he can but interest the poles on his side his affairsmust thrivethe hon tom dashall by this time was puzzled with the lengthenedintroduction this gentleman was giving he sipped his coffee lookedgrave smiled took up the paper pretended to read then laid it downagain sparkle looked wise and betrayed his anxiety by moving closerto the communicant tallyhoho fixed his eyes on the old gentleman with anapparent desire to count the words he utteredin the meantime continued the interesting stranger he is soindefatigable in diffusing through all ranks of society by means of thepress and private agents a knowledge of the power he has of smoothingthe way to success that the crown ought to receive his proffered aidfor its own benefitthen said sparkle it really is a document of public importance ifnot too great a favour might we be allowed a sight of the the document oh certainly sir said he hastily rising and drawinga printed paper from his pocket i will leave it with you thenthrowing it on the table he made a precipitate retreatthe little care which the old gentleman seemed to take of this scrap ofimportance struck them all with wondera rum old codger said tom and i recommend his observations as wellas the produce of his pocket to the serious consideration of our friendsparkle who will perhaps read this paper for the benefit of us allsparkle who by this time had unfolded this mysterious paper burst intoa hearty laugh and as soon as he could command his risibility he readas followsprince's russia oil for promoting the growth of hairand sparkle introduced to greece said tom well the old buck haspaid you off for your interruption however he has certainly proved hisown assertion that there is no reliance on any bodya mountain in labour continued tom i think he had you in a linehoweveri cannot help thinking replied sparkle that there is a greatsimilarity between him and some of our most popular parliamentaryorators for he has said a great deal to little purpose but come letus move on and lose no more time in the french coffee house discussingthe merits or virtues of russia oil this proposition being acceded to our friends now took theirway along pall mall where the improvements recently made struck sparklewith pleasure and delight the appearance of new and elegant housesoccupying the situation of buildings of a shabby and mean exteriorand the introduction of new streets were subjects of considerableadmirationthe rapidity of alterations in london said sparkle are almostinconceivablethat remark replied tom only arises from your late absence from thescene of action for to us who frequently see their progress there isbut little to excite wonder now for my part i am more astonishedin present times when so many complaints are made of distress thatoccupiers can be found for them and also seeing the increase ofbuildings at every part of the environs of london where tenants can befound to occupy themi confess said tallyhoho that is a subject which i have often thoughtupon without being able to come to any reasonable conclusion it appearsto me to prove a great increase of population for although i am awareof the continued influx of new comers from the country the towns andvillages appear as full as everi am not able to solve the mystery to my own satisfaction repliedsparkle in either case though i cannot help acknowledging the factsalluded to it however seems in this place to prove the correctness ofthe poet's lines who sayswherever round this restless world we rangenothing seems constant saving constant changelike some magician waving mystic wandimprovement metamorphoses the landgrubs up pulls down then plants and builds anewtill scenes once loved are banished from our viewthe draughtsman with officious eye surveyswhat capabilities a site displayshow things may be made better for the worseand much improve at least the schemer's pursecontinuing their course along parliamentstreet they soon arrived atwestminsterbridge when the day proving extremely fine it was proposedto embrace the opportunity of making an excursion by water the tideserved for london bridge and without further ceremony tom bob andsparkle jumped into a wherry and were quickly gliding along upon thebosom of old father thames the smiling appearance of the day and thesmooth unruffled surface of the water excited the most cheerful andenlivening feelings of the mind nice weather for the rowing match said a bluff lookingsturdy built waterman who had doffed his coat waistcoat and cravatin order to facilitate him in performing his dutyrowing match inquired tom when does it take placewhy this afternoon at four o'clock your honour vauxhall will be veryfull tonight them ere people what's got it now are a getting plentyof company and they will have a bumper tonight for the gentlemen whatbelongs to the funny club gives a funny to be rowed forthat's funny enough exclaimed sparkleand convenient too said tom for as we have no engagement for theevening we can mingle with the lads on their water frolicwith all my heart said bob and as i am given to understand vauxhallis greatly improved it will make an admirable wind up of the dayapproaching waterloo bridge what have we here exclaimed tallyhohothat said tom is a floating fire engine for the protection ofshipping and sometimes very useful in cases of fire on the banks of theriveran excellent idea continued bob because they can never be in wantof waterwill you sit a little more this way sir if you please we shall trimbetterbob rose hastily upon this intimation and had not his cousin caught himby the coat would have trimmed himself into the watery elementzounds man you had nearly upset us all you must trim the boat andsit steady or we shall all go to davy's locker you must not attemptto dance in such a vehicle as thisbob's confusion at this circumstance created laughter to his twofriends which however he could not exactly enjoy with the same relishnor did he perfectly recover himself till they were safely landed attower stairsnow said tom i propose a peep at the interior of this place a rowdown to greenwich to dinner and then a touch at the rowing match whatsay you agreed on all hands then said the hon tom dashall wait for us here old boyand you shall be our conveyanceri don't know nothing of you gentlemen and you understand me i'mnot a going to be done i'm too old a hand to be catch'd in that therefashion but if so be you engages me for the day you can take thenumber of my boat but then you must tipright said sparkle who knows whether we shall escape the lions andthen how is old rough and tough to get paidyou'll excuse me gentlemen i don't mean no affront upon my soul buti have stood the nonsense before now and been flung but i won'tbe served out in that there way any more i am up to the gossip andexpects you'll come down with the ragcertainly said tom dashall with a smile i am aware of the hintwhich by the way is pretty broadly conveyed therefore be satisfiedand giving him a sovereign they proceeded into the towerthe entrance to the tower from the wharf is by a drawbridge near towhich is a cut connecting the river with the ditch having a water gatecalled traitor's gate state prisoners having been formerly conveyed bythis passage from the tower to westminster for trial and over this gateis the waterworks which supply the fortresshaving passed the drawbridge bob looked around him almost conceivinghimself in a new world he saw houses and streets

independentof several of the jewels which are inestimable is not less than twomillions sterling now said dashall as they left the jewel office we havetaken a view of the inanimate we must not leave the spot withouta peep at the lionsl for though i believe there is nothing veryextraordinary in the collection more than may be seen at the menagerieat exeter change it would be an unpardonable omission not to see thelions in the tower the wild beasts c are shewn at s eachfor this purpose they proceeded to the western entrance where they werequickly introduced by the keeper to the various animals under his careand who in going round with them explained as usual their severalhistoriesin examining these various curiosities time had imperceptibly stolen amarch upon them and their original plan of proceeding to greenwich wasfound to be impracticable besides which upon reaching the stairs wherethey had landed the bluff old waterman was not to be foundzounds said dashall this looks like a do i wonder what's become ofthe old bladesparkle began to laugh and bob bit his lip tom made inquiry of a boyat the stairs who informed him that barney was gone to the settlinghouse to smoak a pipeall right said tom then we will soon rouse him and startupon this they moved back again into the tower and according to thedirections they had received they found barney in the taproompuffing away care and singing with stentorian voice to the surroundingcompanyfrom elongate to limehouse holeyou will not meet a kinder soulwhile the thames is flowingpull away ho pull away ho in search of real life and character and at all times ratherinclined to promote mirth than spoil sport our friends immediatelyentered unperceived by barney and taking an opposite corner of theroom were quickly attended by the landlord who received orders andproduced them suppliesthe song being over and barney rewarded for his exertions by the mostenthusiastic applause of the room he renewed his pipe at the sametime declaring to a soldier who sat near him he thought he had miss'dfire for he was d d if he didn't think he'd lost his companyor his company had lost him but that he had taken care to nibble theblunt and upon that there score all was right so landlord tip usanother quart and if they don't make their appearance by the timei've got through that i'll tip them the toddle shove off my boat anddisappear that's the time of day an't it boywhy aye to be sure replied the soldier you watermen leads a happylife you are your own masters you does just as you pleases while asoldier dare as well be d d as desert his post but i say barneymind whatyou says nose nose accompanying the last two words with asignificant action of placing his finger on his nose and winking hiseyeupon this intimation which appeared to be well understood by barneyhe puffed off an immoderate cloud of smoke and looking round the roomperceived his customers in the cornerbe quiet said he that's my fare so it's all right again do youwant me gentlemen i am always ready so that whenever you says theword barney's your boypresently said dashall for it would be hard to make you start upona full jorumwhy i must say continued barney i never likes to leave a foamingquart behind me and catching hold of the pot of heavy wet he roaredoutwhat a hearty blade am icare can never touch my heartevery trouble i defywhile i view the foaming quartand taking a hearty drink he handed it to his companion filledhis pipe afresh lighted and informed the gentlemen he was at theirservice when in a few minutes all being ready they were quickly onboard i don't like the looks of the weather my masters why weshall have a shower presently where will you go toto vauxhall was the replyvery well your honour then here goes but if you don't get a sousingmy name an't barneythis prognostication proved true for before they reached blacksmithsbridge a smart shower came on which nearly wetted them through beforethey could reach land when this was accomplished they proceeded to thehorn tavern doctors commons where they partook of an excellent repastand the weather clearing up they again joined barneyby this time the promising fineness of the evening had induced manyto venture forth to the rowing match and the river was all gaiety anddelight boats of every description were seen filled with well dressedpersons both male and female the smiling countenances of the lads andlasses were in unison with the laughing sun that darted his brilliantbeams upon the dimpled wave which seemed to leap in return withgrateful animation the shores were lined with spectators anxiouslywaiting the moment for the commencement of this trial of skill ourfriends were highly delighted with the prospect before them and at theappointed time having rested on their oars near the place of startingthey saw with pleasure the active preparations on the part of thecompetitors and upon the signal being given for the start the riverappeared to consist of nothing but moving conveyances of happy facesall guided in one direction the shouts of the various friends of theoccasionally successful candidates for the honour of victory and theskill and dexterity with which they manoeuvred against each other weresubjects of continued admiration while bands of music were heard fromboats that intermingled with the throng the lads of the funny club werein high glee numerous cutters and sailing boats with their owners andvisiting friends were also in the throng barney pulled away likea good one and for a considerable distance kept nearly up with theprincipal actors in this gay and animated scene of aquatic diversionand arrived off cumberland gardens just in time to have an excellentview of the winner coming in at the appointed spot in prime styleamidst the loud and reiterated plaudits of his friends the intention of visiting vauxhall gardens was however forthe present evening relinquished and our party feeling fatigued bytheir excursion repaired homeward where for the present we shall leavethem to their quiet and reposechapter xxiii hate that drum's discordant soundstill rolling round and round and round exclaimed dashall as he advanced from the breakfast tabletowards the window when a pleasing and singular streetexhibitionpresented itself which had attracted around a numerous audience of allages and conditionsan itinerant purveyor of novelties was in the act of showing forth to anadmiring crowd the docility of a tame hare on a table in the streeton which was placed a drum the little animal stood in an erectposture and with surprising tractableness obeyed the commands of itsexhibiter delivered in very broken english with which neverthelessit seemed perfectly conversantvat matter now dat you be so solly and no take

with a cone of particular respect whichbeing acknowledged with a motion of the hand by dashall the intelligentanimal expressed its sense of his complacency by a second obeisancemore profound than the firstthe spectators applauded and the performer testified its gratitude by abow all rounddat all good now are tree role on de from for le roid'angletterre vive le roi d'anglettere this command the animal very promptly obeyed by substituting its forefeetfor sticks and giving three prolonged rolls of the drum each indistinctsuccessionnow den for messieurs with equal alacrity this hint was attended to and as le roid'angletterre had three so de gentlemen at de window were honouredwith two rolls of the drumthe like compliment was paid to all de english peoples and the minorsalute of one

frequently complied withwill you take notice of me denthis question was instantly answered by the accustomed mark of respectgentleman at de window and peoples on de street my leetel drummerno love de

animal reiterated its obeisancediable exclaimed the exhibiter here comes de cook to kill and spityouthe hare instantly hastened to its hiding place and thus terminated theexhibitionthis epitome of the world observed tallyhoho lacks nothing to gratifyevery sense of man here industry is on the alert to accumulate wealthand dissipation in haste to spend it here riot and licentiousnessroll triumphantly in gilded state while merit pines in penury andobscurity and here ingenuity roams the streets for a scanty andprecarious subsistence exhibiting learned pigs dogs and soforth that will cast accounts with the precision of an experiencedarithmetician and a tame hare that will beat a drum and make a bowmore gracefully than a dancingmaster this last instance of humaningeniousness by which the poor frenchman picks up a living wouldalmost induce a belief that the power of art is inimitable and thatapparently insurmountable difficulties may be overcome by diligentperseverance who besides this foreigner would have thought ofdivesting a hare of its natural timidity and rendering it subservientby a display of intelligence to the acquirement of his subsistence and who said dashall would have thought but a german oftraining canarybirds to imitate military evolution make a prisonerof one of their fellows as a deserter try and condemn him todeath apparently execute the sentence by shooting him with a smallgun and finally bear away the motionless and seemingly lifeless bodyon a wheelbarrow for interment nay who would think of inverting theorder of nature by creating and cementing a union of friendship betweencats and birds and mice associating them together within the confinesof a cage in the utmost harmony of social intercourse and who shallpresume to set bounds to the human art that from a deal board hasconstructed the figure of a man that will beat at the difficult game ofchess the first players in europe and created a wooden musicianthat in a solo from the trumpet will excel the best living performers onthat instrument it appears by the following letter from pressure inhungary that this wonderful automaton was originallyinvented and exhibited thereduring my stay in this city i have been so happy as toform an acquaintance with m de kempett an aulic counsellorand director general of the salt mines in hungary it seemsimpossible to attain to a more perfect knowledge ofmechanics than this gentleman hath done at least no artisthas yet been able to produce a machine so wonderful in itskind as what he constructed about a year ago m dekempett excited by the accounts he received of theextraordinary performances of the celebrated m devaucanson and of some other men of genius in prance andengland at first aimed at nothing more than to imitatethose artists but he has done more he has excelled themhe has constructed an automaton which can play at chesswith the most skilful players this machine represents a manof the natural size dressed like a turk sitting before thetable which holds the chessboard this table which isabout three feet and a half long and about two feet and ahalf broad is supported by four feet that roll on castorsin order the more easily to change its situation which theinventor fails not to do from time to time in order to takeaway all suspicion of any communication both the table andthe figure are full of wheels springs and levers m dekempett makes no difficulty of shewing the inside of themachine especially when he finds any one suspects a boy tobe in it i have examined with attention all the parts bothof the table and figure and i am well assured there is notthe least ground for such an imputation i have played agame at chess with the automaton myself i have particularlyremarked with great astonishment the precision with whichit made the various and complicated movements of the armwith which it plays it raises the arm it advances ittowards that part of the chessboard on which the piecestands which ought to be moved and then by a movement ofthe wrist it brings the hand down upon the piece opens thehand closes it upon the piece in order to grasp it liftsit up and places it upon the square it is to be removed tothis done it lays its arm down upon a cushion whichis placed on the chessboard if it ought totake one of its adversary's pieces then by one entiremovement it removes that piece quite off the chessboardand by a series of such movements as have been describingit returns to take up its own piece and place it in thesquare which the other had left vacant i attempted topractise a small deception by giving the queen the move ofa knight but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposedon he took up my queen and replaced her in the square shehad been removed from all this is done with the samereadiness that a common player shews at this game and ihave often engaged with persons who played neither soexpeditiously nor so skilfully as this automaton who yetwould have been extremely affronted if one had comparedthem to him you will perhaps expect me to propose someconjectures as to the means employed to direct this machinein its movements i wish i could form any that werereasonable and wellfounded but notwithstanding the minuteattention with which i have repeatedly observed it i havenot been able in the least degree to form any hypothesiswhich could satisfy myself the english ambassador princejustinian and several english lords for whom theinventor had the complaisance to make the figure play stoodround the table while i played the game they all had theireyes on m de kempett who stood by the table or sometimesremoved five or six feet from it yet not one of them coulddiscover the least motion in him that could influence theautomaton they who had seen the effects produced by theloadstone in the curious exhibitions on the boulevards atparis cried out that the loadstone must have been themeans here employed to direct the arm but besides thatthere are many objections to this supposition m dekempett with whom i have had long conversations since onthis subject offers to let any one bring as close as hepleases to the table the strongest and bestarmed magnetthat can be found or any weight of iron whatever withoutthe least fear that the movements of his machine will beaffected or disturbed by it he also withdraws to anydistance you please and lets the figure play four or fivemoves successively without approaching it it is unnecessaryto remark that the marvellous in this automaton consistschiefly in this that it has not as in others the mostcelebrated machines of this sort one determined series ofmovements but that it always moves in consequence of themanner in which its opponent moves which produces anamazing multitude of different combinations in itsmovements m de kempett winds up from time to time thesprings of the arm of this automaton in order to renew itsmoving force but this you will observe has no relation toits guiding force or power of direction which makes thegreat merit of this machine in general i am of opinionthat the contriver influences the direction of almost everystroke played by the automaton although as i have said ihave sometimes seen him leave it to itself for many movestogether which in my opinion is the mostdifficultcircumstance of all to comprehend in what regards thismachine m de kempett has the more merit in this inventionas he complains that his designs have not always beenseconded by workmen so skilful as was requisite to the exactprecision of a work of this nature and he hopes he shallere long produce to the world performances still moresurprising than this indeed one may expect every thing fromhis knowledge and skill which are exceedingly enhanced byhis uncommon modesty never did genius triumph with lessostentation london is a rare place for sights always somethingnew where the spirits need never flag through want of amusement letme recapitulate there is the automaton

purposes of utility or ornament it appears answered dashall as if some such improvementwas in projection probably a new square if we may so opine frompresent indications however be the intention what it may theexecution is uncommonly tardy with the exception of the centralironrailing the handsome structure on the opposite side the solitarybuilding on the right and range of new houses on the left

extended my rambles intothe quarters of cornfields for so was this place then named from itscompartments exhibiting rural appearance even in the centre of londonhere were four enclosed fields displaying in the season the beautifulverdure of nature and numerous trees branching in ample shade overtwo great walks that intersected each other at right angles and formedthe afternoon promenade of the citizens wives and daughters in formertimes the quarters of cornfields were resorted to by holiday visitantsas the favourite place of rendezvous where predominated the recreationof manly exercises and shows gambols and merriment were the orders ofthe day the present is an age of improvement and yet i cannot thinkin an already monstrously overgrown metropolis the substitution ofbricks and mortar

has set himself a task with avengeanceand which answered his friend he will never be able to accomplishhowever the ambition of renown as a voluminous collector is the lesscensurable as being unattended by any of its too frequently perniciousconcomitants and giving to others an acceptable and not irrationalemployment he is only blameable in the projected extent not the natureof his pursuit and happy would it be for mankind did the love of fameengender no greater evil than that if any which may accrue from theherculean labours of this epitaph collectoryet to us the uninitiated of the country it would never occur thatthere existed even in london a man who disseminated his fortune andapplied his mental and corporeal energies in gleaning epitaphsneither perhaps would it occur that there existed even in london avirtuoso who discovered that fleas were a species of lobster and whoproceeded to proof by the ordeal of boiling water on the suppositionthat the process would change their hue from black to red and thussatisfactorily establish the correctness of his judgment unfortunatelyhowever the boiled fleas still retained their original colour and theingenious hypothesis was reluctantly relinquished it is told of another virtuoso that he was waited uponone morning by a stranger who announced that he had theopportunity of procuring an inestimable curiosity a hornedcock but that its owner an avaricious old woman had herdomicile in the highlands of scotland to which remoteregion it would be necessary to travel amply provided withthe pecuniary means of securing this wonderful bird andthat it would be expedient to set out immediately lest thematchless phenomenon should become the prize of a morefortunate competitora horned cock the very acme of frolicsome nature

of its object the anxiety of the virtuoso wasinexpressible a horned cock it was the incessant subjectof his cogitations by day and of his dreams by night atlast the auspicious moment arrived in the still noontide ofnight the preconceived rap at the street door announced thehappy result of the momentous expedition the virtuososprang from his couch with extasy to admit the illustriousprodigy of

awicker basket when lo the bird shorn of its honoursindignant at confinement and struggling for freedom haddropped its waxen antlers the unfortunate virtuoso stoodaghast and speechless and only at last found utterance tocurse his own credulity pursuing their course along the city road the two friends wereattracted by the appearance of a caravan stationary on the road sidewhereon was inscribed in large characters the female salamanderhere is another instance observed dashall of the varieties of reallife in londonwalk in gentlemen exclaimed the proprietor and see the surprisingyoung woman over whom the element of fire has no controltom and bob accepted the invitation entering the caravan they werereceived by an interesting young female apparently not more thaneighteen years of age with a courteousness of manner far beyond whatcould have been expected from an itinerant exhibitorso soon as a sufficient number of spectators had congregated within thevehicle the female salamander commenced her exhibitiontaking a redhot poker from the fire she grasped it firmly and drewit from head to point through her hand without sustaining the smallestinjury will you permit me to look at your hand asked dashallthe girl extended her hand the palm was moist and seemed to havebeen previously fortified against danger by some secret liquid orother application now reeking from its recent contact with the flamingweaponan uncivilized bumpkin accused her of deception asserting that thepoker was not heated to the extent representedtouch and try answered the girl he did so and the cauterizinginstrument gave a feeling although not very satisfactory negative tohis assertionthe mystery continued dashall of resisting the impression oftire certainly originates in the liquid by which your hand has beenprotectedi shall answer your observation said the salamander by anotherperformanceshe then dipped her fingers into a pot of molten lead and let fallupon her tongue several drops of the metallic fluid to the no smallamazement and terror of the company and as if to remove the idea ofprecautionary application she after a lapse of five minutes repeatedthe same extraordinary exhibition and finally immerged her naked feetin the boiling materialthe inscrutable means by which the salamander executed these feats withthe most complete success and safety were not to be divulged and asneither of our respectable friends felt desirous of emulating the fairexorbitant they declined the importunity of further inquirythis is indeed said dashall as they resumed their walk the ageof wonders here is a girl who can bear to gargle her mouth with meltedlead put her delicate feet into the same scalding material and passthrough her hands a flaming redhot poker i am inclined to believethat were the present an age of superstition she might be burnt for awitch were she not happily incombustible for my own part i sincerelyhope that this pyrophorous prodigy will never think of quitting her owncountry and as i am a bachelor i verily believe i should be tempted tomake her an offer of my hand could i flatter myself with any chanceof raising aflame or making a match with such uninflammable commodityonly conceive the luxury when a man comes home fatigued and in a hurryfor his tea of having a wife who can instantly take out the heaterfor the urn with her fingers stir the

ascertain the heat before she began toworkand observed the squire taking up his friend's vein of humour ifthe young lady be as insensible to the flames of cupid as she is tothose of vulcan she might still be highly useful in a national point ofview and well worthy the attention of the various fireofficesexactly so replied his cousin how desirable for instance would ithave been at the late alarming fire in gracechurchstreet to have hada trustworthy person like her who could very coolly perambulatethe blazing warehouses to rescue from the flames the most valuablecommodities or lolling

essential services she might performin glasshouses for instance it is notorious that great mischiefsometimes arises from inability to ascertain when the sand and flinthave arrived at the proper degree

ofwater with barges gliding majestically on its placid wave where latelyappeared open fields arrayed in the verdure of nature afforded fullscope for remark by mr dashall on the gigantic design and rapidaccomplishment by commercial enterprize of the most stupendousundertakingsthis work of incalculable public utility said mr dashall spranginto being with the alacrity of enchantment the same remark mayapply to every other improvement of this vast metropolis so rapid inexecution that one thinks of the wonderful lamp and the magnificentpalace of aladdin erected in one night by the attendant geniionwards towards merry islington here said dashall is the newriver this fine artificial stream is brought from two springs at chadwell and am well in hertfordshire for the supply of london with waterit was finished in by sir hugh middleton a citizen of london whoexpended his whole fortune in this public undertaking the river withallits windings is nearly miles in length it has sluicesand bridges over and under it a great number of brooks andwatercourses have their passage in some places this canal is carriedthrough vales and in others through subterraneous passages itterminates in a basin called the new river head close by from thereservoir at islington the water is conveyed by main pipes undergroundalong the middle of the principal streets and thence by leadenpipes to the different houses thus by means of the new river andof the london bridge waterworks every house in the metropolis isabundantly supplied with water at the expense each of a few shillingsonly per annum

countryobserve the angel inn celebrated for its ordinary where you mayenjoy after a country ramble an excellent dinner on very moderateterms apropos of the angel inn ordinary some years ago it wasregularly every sunday attended by a thin meagre gaunt and bonyfigure of cadaverous aspect who excited amongst the other guests nosmall degree of dismay and not without cause denominated the wolf hejustified his pretensions to the appellation by his almost incrediblepowers of gormandizing for a quantum of viands sufficient for six menof moderate appetite would vanish on the magic contact of his knife andfork in the twinkling of an eye in fact his voracity was consideredof boundless extent for he invariably and without cessation consumedby wholesale so long as eatables remained on the table one day afterhaving essentially contributed to the demolition of a baron of beef anddevoured an entire shoulder of lamb with a commensurate proportion ofbread roots vegetables c he pounced with the celerity of a hawkon a fine roast goose which unfortunately happened to have been justthen placed within the reach of his annihilating fangs and in a veryshort space of time it was reduced to a skeleton having occasion for afew minutes to leave the room the company in the meanwhile secreted thebones of the goose the waiter now entered for the purpose of removingthe cloth casting his eyes round the room he seemed absorbed inperplexity what is the matter asked one of the company do you missarty thing yes sir the bones of a goose why then you may saveyourself the trouble of further search the gentleman just gone outof modest manners and puny appetite has devoured the goose bones andall the waiter lost no time in reporting the appalling fact tohis master who now more than ever was desirous of getting rid of theglutton but how it was impossible to exclude him the ordinary or setbounds to his appetite the only resource left was that of buying himoff which was done at the rate of one shilling per diem and the wolftook his hebdomadary repast at a different ordinary from this also hisabsence was purchased at the same rate as by the first speculating onhis gluttony he levied similar contributions on the proprietors of theprincipal ordinaries in the metropolis and environs and if the fellowis still living i have no doubt of his continuing to derive hissubsistence from the sources already described now what think you ofreal life in london the wolf so denominated was less censurable for hisgluttony than the infamous purpose to which he applied itotherwise he had a parallel in a man of sublime geniushandel one day entered a tavern in the city and ordered sixmackay you are right to a letter thesphinx is a monsterman and i sure enough am a munstermani know it what would'st thou sir felix o'o'grady the baronet felt surprised by this familiar recognition of hisperson and replied by observing that as the inquirer so well knew hisname he might also be acquainted with the nature of his businessi partly guess it rejoined the seer and although i cannotabsolutely predict restitution of thy lost property yet i foresee thataccident will throw the depredator in thy

next ushered into the sanctum sanatorium bob was at a loss what to say not having prepared himself with anyreasonable pretext of inquiry a silence of a few moments was theconsequence and the squire having first reconnoitred the person of theconjurer who was arrayed in the appropriate costume of his professionscrutinized the apartment when the attention of the visitor and visitedbeing again drawn to each other the soothsayer addressed himself totallyhoho in the following wordsthe shadows of joy shall the mind appaland the deathlight dimly flit round the hallof him by base lucre who led astrayshall age into fruitless minion betraythe deathlight shall glimmer in melvillehalland childless the lord of the mansion falla wife when he weds vain ugly and oldthough charms she brings forty thousand in goldthe squire was not prone to anger but that this fellow should interferewith his private concerns and impute to him the intention of forming amost preposterous connexion under the influence of avarice roused himinto a whirlwind of passion rascal he exclaimed who take uponyou to predict the fate of others are you aware of your own vagabondimposter here i grasp you nor will i quit my hold until i surrenderyou into the hands of justice and suiting the action to the word heseized and shook the unfortunate seer to the manifest discomposure ofhis bones who loudly and lamentably cried out for assistance alarmedby the clamour dashall and the baronet rushed up stairs to whom thesquire stated the aggravation received and at the same timehis determination to bring the cheat to punishment the tremblingculprit sued for mercy conscious that he was amenable to correction asarogue and vagabond and if convicted as such would probably be sentto expiate his offence in the treadingmill at brixton a place ofatonement for transgression which of all others he dreaded the most unionhall hannah tompkins a miserable woman of thetown was brought before r g chambers esq charged withhaving robbed another of the unfortunate class of herclothes it appeared that the prisoner had been liberatedfrom brixton prison on fridaylast after a confinement ofthree weeks and that on coming out she was met by thecomplainant catherine flynn by whom she was taken to acomfortable lodging supplied with necessaries and treatedwith great kindness the prisoner acted with propriety untilmonday night during which she remained out in the streetson tuesday morning at four o'clock she came home drenchedwith rain the complainant desired her either to go to bedor to light a fire and dry her clothes the prisoner didneither and the complainant went to sleep at about seventhe latter awoke and missed her gown petticoat andbonnet the prisoner was also missing the complainantlearned that her clothes were at a pawnbroker's shop wherethey had been left a short time before by the prisonerhall the officer having heard of the robbery went inquestof the prisoner and found her in a ginshop inblackmanstreet in a state of intoxication he brought herbefore the magistrates in this condition her hair washanging about her face which was swelled and discoloured bythe hardship of the preceding night she did not deny thatshe had stolen the clothes of her poor benefactress but shepleaded in her excuse that the condition of her body fromthe rain of monday night was such that nothing but gincould have saved her life and the only way she had ofgetting that medicine was by pledging natty flynn'sclothes the magistrates asked the prisoner whether she hadnot got enough of the treadingmill at brixton the prisonerbegged for mercy's sake not to be sent to the treadingmillshe would prefer transportation for it was much morehonourable to go over the water than to be sent as a rogueand vagabond to brixton she was sent back to prison it isa remarkable fact that since the famous treadingmill hasbeen erected at brixton the business of this office hasgreatly declined the mill is so constructed that when aman ventures to be idle in it he receives a knock on thehead from a piece of wood which is put there to give themnotice of what they ere to do the two ancient sybil from the lower regions having nowascended the scene of confusion united their voices with that of theastrologer and dashall and sir felix also interceding in his behalfthe squire yielded to the general entreaty and promised the soothsayerforgiveness on condition that he disclosed the source whence hederived information as to the baronet's family concerns the soothsayerconfessed that he had elicited intelligence from the servant whoin his simplicity had revealed so much of his master's affairs as toenable him the conjurer to sustain his reputation even with sir felixhimself whom from description he recognized on his first entrance andby the same means and with equal ease identified the person of thesquire of melvillehall he added besides that he had frequently bysimilar stratagem acquired intelligence that chance had more than oncefavoured him by verifying his predictions and thus both his fame andfinances had obtained aggrandisement he now promised to relinquishcelestial for sublunary pursuits and depend for subsistence rather onthe exercise of honest industry than on public credulitythus far had matters proceeded when the baronet's servant thady wasannounced the triumvirate anticipating some extraordinary occurrencedesired the soothsayer to resume his functions and give the valetimmediate audience while they retired into another apartment to waitthe result in a few minutes the servant was dismissed and the partyreadmittedchance said the augured has again befriended me i told you sirfelix that the depredator would be thrown in your way my prediction isrealized he has been accidentally encountered by your servant and isnow in safe custodyon this information our party turned homewards first leaving theastrologer a pecuniary stimulation to projected amendment of lifethere seems nothing of inherent vileness said the squire as theywalked onwards in this man's principles he may have been drivenby distress to his present pursuits and i feel happy that i did notconsign the poor devil to the merciless fangs of the law as in themoment of irritation i had intendedby my conscience exclaimed sir felix i cannot discover that heought to be punished at all he has been picking up a scanty living bypreying on public credulity and from the same source thousands in thismetropolis derive affluent incomes and with patronage and impunity and added dashall in cases of minor offence a welltimedclemency is frequently both in policy and humanity preferable torelentless severity as k to the wardrobe of its rightful ownerthis business happily concluded and the day not much beyond itsmeridian the three friends again sallied forth in the directionof bondstreet towards piccadilly as usual the loungers weresuperabundant and ridiculous paired together and swerving continuallyfrom the direct line it required some skilful manoeuvring to passthem our friends had surmounted several such impediments when a newobstruction to their progress presented itself a party of exquisitehad linked themselves together and occupied the entire pavementso that it was impossible to precede them without getting into thecarriageway thus greatly obstructing and inconveniencing all otherpassengers lounging at a funeral pace and leaving not the smallestopening it was evident that these effeminate animals hadpurposely united themselves for public annoyance sir felix irritatedby this palpable outrage on decorum stepped forward with hastydetermined stride and coming unexpectedly and irresistibly in contactbroke at once the concatenated barrier to the great amusement aswell as accommodation of the lookerson and total discomfiture of theexquisite who observing the resolute mien and robust form of theirassailant not forgetting a formidable piece of timber alias sprigof shillaleagh which he bore in his hand prudently consulted theirsafety and forbore resentment of the interruption if in walking the streets of london the passenger keptthe right hand side it would prevent the frequentrecurrence of much jostling and confusion the laws of theroad are observed on the carriageway in the metropolis mostminutely else the street would be in a continual blockadebutthe laws of the road are a paradox quitethat puzzles the marvelling throngfor if on the left you are yet on the rightand if you are right you are wrongthe baronet's two associates very much approved of his spiritedinterference and dashall observed that these insignificant beingswhom sir felix had so properly reproved were to be seen thusincommoding the public in all parts of the metropolis but moreparticularly westward that in crowded streets however for instancein the direct line from charing cross to the royal exchange theapparent exquisite are generally thieves and pickpockets who finda harvest in this extensive scene of business by artful depredationeither upon the unwary tradesman or equally unsuspecting passengerwhose wiper or tattler and sometimes both becomes the frequent produceof their active ingenuitythe morning had been wet and although the flagway was dry yet thecarriageroad was dirty there are in all parts of the metropolisindigent objects of both sexes who by sweeping the crossway pick upan eleemosynary livelihood it not unfrequently happens however thata chariot or other vehicle is drawn up at one end of the crosswaydirectly athwart it so as completely to intercept your way to thepavement exactly so situated were our pedestrians they had availedthemselves of a newly swept path and were advancing towards theopposite side in piccadilly when before they could effecttheir purpose a carriage drew up and effectually impeded furtherprogress by the crossway so that there seemed no alternative betweenstanding fast and gaining the pavement by walking through the mud thecoachman retained his position despite of remonstrance and in thislaudable stubbornness he was encouraged by a wellattired female insidethe vehicle for the carriage was a private one and its illmanneredinmate probably a lady of rank and fashion sir felix justly indignantat this treatment set danger and inconvenience at defiance anddeliberately walking to the horses heads led the animals forward untilthe carriage had cleared the crossway maugre the threats of the ladyand the whip of the coachman who had the audacity to attempt exercisingit on the person of the baronet when tallyhoho dreading the consequencesto the rash assailant sprang upon the box and arresting his handsaved the honour of munster the transaction did not occupy above twominutes yet a number of people had collected and vehemently applaudedsir felix and the lady's companion now hastily reentering the chariotfrom an adjacent shop mr jehu drove off rapidly amidst the hoots andhisses of the multitude sir felix had not heard of the following incident else hecertainly would have followed its exampletwo ladies of distinction stopped in a carriage at ajeweller's near charingcross one of them only got out andthe coach stood across the pathway which some gentlemenwanted to cross to the other side and desired the coachmanto move on a little the fellow was surly and refused thegentlemen remonstrated but in vain during the altercationthe lady came to the shop door and foolishly ordered thecoachman not to stir from his place on this one of thegentlemen opened the coachdoor and with boots and spursstepped through the carriage he was followed by hiscompanions to the extreme discomposure of the lady withinas well as the lady without to complete the jest a partyof sailors coming up observed that if this was athoroughfare they had as much right to it as the penmenand accordingly scrambled through the carriagethe poor streetsweeper having applied to sir felix for a miteof benevolence and is it for letting the carriage block up thecrossway and forcing me through the mud asked the baronet butwhether or not i have not got any halfpence about me so that i mustpay you when i come again ah your honour exclaimed the man itis unknown the credit i give in this way sir felix thrust his handinto his pocket and rewarded the applicant with a tester proceeding along piccadilly our party were followed bya newfoundland dog which circumstance attracted the notice of thebaronet to whom more than to either of his associates the animal seemedto attach itself pleased with its attention sir felix caressed it andwhen the triumvirate entered a neighbouring coffeehouse the dog waspermitted to accompany them scarcely had the three friends seatedthemselves when a man of decent appearance came into the room andwithout ceremony accused the baronet of having by surreptitious meansobtained possession of his property in other words of having inveigledaway his dog and demanding instant restitutionsir felix fired at the accusation divested as it was of the shadow oftruth yet unsuspicious of design would have instantly relinquished hiscanine acquaintance but for the interposition of dashall who suspectedthis intrusive personage to be neither more nor less than a dogstealerof whom there are many in london continually on the alert for bootythese fellows pick up all stray dogs carry them home and detain themuntil such time as they are advertised and a commensurate reward isoffered by the respective owners if then the dog is intrinsicallyof no value and consequently unsaleable the adept in this species ofdepredation finding he can do no better takes the dog homereceives the promised reward and generally an additional gratuity incompensation of keep and trouble but should it so happen that theproffered remuneration is not equivalent to the worth of the animal theconscientious professor of knavery carries his goods to a more lucrativemarket at the instance of dashall therefore sir felix was determinedto retain the animal until the claimant brought irrefragable proofof ownership the fellow blustered the baronet was immovable in hisresolution when the other threw off all disguise and exhibitinghimself in pristine blackguardism inundated sir felix pertained rose likemany others the children of industry from comparative indigence toaffluence and from obscurity to eminencethe party was select the dinner was sumptuous yet unostentatious andthe conversation if not exactly in the first class of refinement wasto the two strangers interestingly instructive as embracing topics ofmercantile pursuit with which they had hitherto been unacquainted itwas also highly enlivened by the sprightly sallies of three beautifuland elegantly accomplished young ladies the daughters of the amiablehost and hostess and to these fair magnets of attraction whom dashallhappily denominated the graces our gallant cavaliers were particularlyassiduous in their attentions the party broke up after an evening ofreciprocal enjoyment and dashall on the way home expressed his beliefthat with the solitary exception of one colossal instance of ignoranceand brutality the very respectable man in society is most generallyto be found among the merchants of london the very respectable man is the true representative ofthe commercial character of great britain he possesses moreinformation than the dutch trader and more refinement thanthe scotch manufacturer with all the businessqualifications of either he is shrewd industrious manlyand independent and as he is too much in earnest for theslightest affectation he shews his character in his dresshis carriage and his general appearance his dress is atonce plain and neat and if his coat should accidentallyexhibit the cut of a more genteel manufacturer theinterstice between his boot he wears top boots and smallclothesthe fashion of his cravat which is rolled round astiffer two inches in diameter and tied in a bow besidesa variety of other more minute characteristics decidedlyrefute all suspicion of an attempt at attaining theappearance of a man of fashion the end of a spitalfieldssilkhandkerchief just appearing from the pocket hole at thetop of his skirt shews at once his regard for good thingsand native manufactures while the dignity of his treaddeclares his consciousness of his own importance theimportance of a very respectable man and to attribute itto any other than such an honest pride would bederogatory to his reputation and feelings if he meets abusiness acquaintance of an higher rank than his own

voicewith considerable power and flexibility and of madame georgia aneast indian lady who afterwards sung very charmingly in the rotundaaccompanying herself on the piano forte in a style which proved

sparkle received a letter from merrywellwith information of the death of his uncle and of his succession tothe estate having arrived just in time to prevent his decease without awill this was a subject of exultation to all the party though to nonemore so than sparkle particularly as the estate alluded to was situatedin the neighbourhood of his own residencemerrywell said dashall will become

said sparkle without crossing and jostling and if he hashis own good in view he will reside chiefly in the country choosean amiable partner for life and only pay a visit to the metropolisoccasionally

for instance at young lord lappet cares for nothing all blood andspirit fire and tow up to every thing and down as a hammerhis is a general case replied sparkle and is only one amongnumerous others to prove that many of the disorders which are dailyvisible in high life may be traced to the education or rather the wantof education of the youthful nobility and gentry it would be a shockingand insupportable degradation to send a sprig of fashion to school amongcommon boys where probably he might learn something really useful nono he must have a private tutor who is previously instructed to teachhim nothing more than what will enable him to pass muster as not quitea fool under this guidance he skims over a few authors almost withoutreading and at all events without knowing what they have writtenmerely with a view to acquaint him that there were once such persons inexistenceafter which this tutor accompanies him to one of the publicschools westminster harrow or eton where the tutor

immediate neighbourhood of afamous place of instruction called tothill vulgarly tuttle fieldswhere every species of refined lewdness and debauchery and manners themost depraved are constantly

attorney must have awrit of error ready and give it to the plaintiffs attorneybefore the master which puts him to a very great expenseas he will have the same charges to go over again the writof error will cost you l s if you want to be furthertroublesome to your plaintiffs make your writ of errorreturnable in parliament which costs you l s and yourplaintiff should he have the courage to follow youthrough all your proceedings then file a bill in theexchequer which will cost about l or l and if heanswers it it will cost him sol more after this you mayfile a bill in chancery which will cost about l and ifhe does not answer this bill you will get an injunctionand at the same time an attachment from the court againsthim and may take his body for contempt of court in notanswering your last bill you may file your bill in thecourt of chancery instead of the exchequer only the lattercosts you the least if you are at any time served with acopy of a writ take no further notice of it than by keepingit when you are declared against do not fail to put in aspecial plea immediately and most likely you will hear nomore of the business as your plaintiff will probably notlike to incur any further expense after having been at somuchthus a creditor may be put to an expense of three hundredand fourteen pounds by a debtor for the small cost of ls and all because the laws allowed him to sue for hisown and if he and his attorney do not keep a sharp lookoutthe creditor may get committed for contempt of court i perceive said tom that your imagination is flyingaway from your subject though i admit the justice of your remarks asgenerally applicable to what is termed the higher ranks of societyand that they are imitated or aped in succession to those of the lowerorders but we appear to have imperceptibly got into a long descriptiveconversation instead of pursuing our usual plan of drawing inferencesfrom actual observation let us toto get in with now my masters you please and seems quite as muchat home as mr matthews at the lyceum with all that sort of thing andevery thing in the world he is however not singular in his tastefor many of our hereditary statesmen are to be found among this classsave and except that he carries his imitations to a farther extent thanany person i ever knew and it is a fact that he had one of his foreteethpunched out in order to enable the noble aspirant to give thetrue coachman's whistle and to spit in a jehulike manner so as toproject the saliva from his lips clear of the cattle and traces intothe hedge on the near side of the roadaccomplishments that are truly deserving the best considerations of anoble mind rejoined tallyhohoand absolutely necessary to the finished gentleman of the present dayof course continued sparkle and as i have not had a lounge in thesecorinthian regions for some little time i am glad to be thus furnishedwith a key to characters that may be new to methere is one on the opposite side of the way not altogether new as hehas made some noise in the world during his time i mean the gentlemanwhose features exhibit so much of the rouge it is the celebrated sirgeorge skippington formerly well known in fop's alley and at theopera not so much on account of his elegant person lively witor polished address as for his gallantries and an extraordinaryaffectation of dress approaching very nearly to the ridiculous thechief part of his reputation being derived from wearing a peagreencoat and pink silk stockings he has however since that time becomea dramatic writer or at least a manufacturer of pantomime and shewand ah but see speaking of writers here we have a hook from whichis suspended a certain scandalous journal well known for its dastardlyattacks upon private character and whose nominal conductors are at thismoment in durance vile but a certain affair in the fashionable way ofdefaulting has brought him down a peg or two his ingenuity has beendisplayed on a variety of occasions and under varying circumstanceshis theatrical attempts have been successful and at harrow he wascalled the green man in consequence of his affected singularity ofwearing a complete suit of clothes of that colour he appears to actat all times upon the favourite recommendation of young rapid keepmoving for he is always in motion in consequence of which it is saidthat lord byron wittily remarked he certainly was not the green manand still the green man and still in the well known sign of apubichouse in oxford road why cried bob there seems to be as little of still lifeabout him just now as there is about hookey walker but pray who isthat dingy gentleman who passed us within the last minute and whoappeared to be an object of attraction to some persons on the oppositeside he appears to have been cut out for a tailorthat replied tom is a baronet and cornet who married the handsomedaughter of a great marquis she however turned out a completetermagant who one day in the heat of her rage d d her rib forasneaking puppy dashed a cup of coffee in his face and immediatelyafter flew for protection to a noble lord who entertained a penchantfor her this however proved to be a bad speculation on her part andhaving seriously reflected on the consequences of such conduct she madeher appearance again at her husband's door a few nights afterwards andin the spirit of contrition sought forgiveness under a promise of nevertransgressing any more little doubting but her claim to admission wouldbe allowed here however it seems she had reckoned without herhost for the baronet differing in opinion would not listen to herproposition her entreaties and promises were urged in vain and thedeserted though still care sposa has kept the portals of his door aswell as the avenues to his heart completely closed to her sinceat this moment they were interrupted by the approach of a gaily dressedyoung man who seizing dashall by the hand and giving him a heartyshake exclaimedha my dear fellow what dashall and as i live mr sparkle you arethere too are you d me what's the scent up to any thing goingany where or any thing to do eh d mequite ad libitum replied dashall happy to see gayfield well andin prime twig allow me to introduce my cousin robert tallyhoho esqyou do me proud my dear fellow any thing new can't live withoutnovelty who's up who's down what's the wonder of the day how doesthe world wag where is the haven of destination and how do you weatherthe point zounds replied tom you ask more questions in a breath thanwe three can answer in an hournever mind don't want you to answer but at all events must havesomething to say hate idleness either in speech or action hate talkingin the streets can't bear staring at like a new monument or a statuetalking of statues i have it good thought go see achilles theladies man eh what say you d me made of cannons and othercombustibles waterloo to wit come along quite a bore to standstillyea or nay can't waitwith all my heart said sparkle twitching dashall by the arm itis quite new since my departure from town and joining arms theyproceeded towards the parkbeen out of town continued gayfield thought so lost you allat once glad you have not lost yourself any thing new in thecountry always inquire can't live without novelty go to see everythingand every body every where nothing new in the papers irishdistresses old but very distressing for a time how the devil can youlive in the country can't imagineand i apprehend replied sparkle it will be of little use toexplain for a gentleman of so much information as yourself must knowevery thinggood but severe never mind i never trouble my head with otherpeople's thoughts always think for myself let others do as they likehate inquisitive people don't choose to satisfy all inquirers neverask questions of any one don't expect answers have you seen thecelebrated ventriloquist alexandre the egyptian tomb the sparkle could hold no longer the vanity and egotism of this everlastingprater this rambler from subject to subject without manner methodor even thought was too much and he could not resist the temptation tolaugh in which he was joined by tom and bob what is the matter inquired gayfield unconscious of beingthe cause of their risibility i see nothing to laugh at d mebut i do love laughing so i'll enjoy a little with you at all eventsand immediately he became a participator in their mirth to theinexpressible delight of his companions but continued he i seenothing to laugh at and it is beneath the character of a philosopher tolaugh at any thingnever mind said dashall we are not of that description and wesometimes laugh at nothing which i apprehend is the case in the presentinstancei perfectly agree with the observation rejoined sparkle it is acase in point and very well pointed toonothing could be better timed said tallyhohowhat than a horse laugh in the public streets d d vulgarreallyquite outre as we say no no you ought to considerwhere you are what company you are in and never laugh without a goodmotive what is the use of laughinga philosopher said tom dashall need scarcely ask such a questionthe superiority of his mind ought to furnish a sufficient answerthen i perceive you are not communicative and i always like to beinformed but never mind here we shall have something to entertain usand at least said sparkle that is better than nothingthe observation however was lost upon the incorrigible fribblerm although thatterm is universally applied to it inasmuch as this statueis not naked the modest artist having at the suggestion ofthese modest ladies taken the precaution of giving achillesa covering similar to that which adam and eve wore on theirexpulsion from eden the attitude of the statue is so questionable as to havealready raised many opposite hypotheses as to what it isreally intended to represent mr exsheriff perkins haswith very laudable ingenuity and classical tastediscovered that the figure is nothing more nor less than asyne or running groom just such a one the worthy exsheriffadds as used to accompany him in india whenengaged in a hunting party and who when he grew tiredused to lay hold of the exsheriff's horse's tail in orderto keep up with his master the author of the travestiehowever has hit upon another solution of the attitudestill more novel and equally probable namely that ofdancing for which he expects to gain no inconsiderableshare of popularity without a shirt or highland skirt it is reallyentertaining to see what a refinement of criticism has beendisplayed upon the defects of this incomparable statue somehave abused the hero for being shirtless and said it was anabomination to think that a statue in a state of nuditymuch larger than life too should be stuck up in hydepark where every lady's eye must glance however repugnantit might be to their ideas of modesty but did not theladies themselves order and pay for the said statue is itnot an emblem of their own pure taste then as forputting on achilles a kelt or short petticoat called by thepoet a highland skirt oh shocking i it is not onlyunclassical but it would have destroyed the effect of thething altogether to be sure it would not be the first timethat achilles wore a petticoat for if we are rightlyinformed his mother thetis disguised him in femaleapparel and hid him among the maidens at the court oflycomedes iu order to prevent his going to the siege oftroy but that wicked wag ulysses calling on the saidmaidens to pay his respects discovered mister achillesamong them and made him join

whowas mounted on a chesnut hunter and whom he had never before seen inthe his was mrs sullivan's story and she told it with suchpathos that all who heard it pitied her except herhusbandit was now mr sullivan's turn to speak whilst his wife wasspeaking he had stood with his back towards her his armsfolded across his breast to keep down his choler biting hislips and staring at the blank wall but the moment she hadceased he abruptly turned round and curiously enoughasked the magistrate whether mistress sullivan had donespeakingshe has replied his worship but suppose you ask herwhether she has any thing more to sayi shall sir exclaimed the angry mr sullivan mistresssullivan had you any more of it to say mrs sullivan raised her eyes to the ceiling clasped herhands together and was silentvery well then he continued will i get lave to spakeyour honourhis honour nodded permission and mr sullivan immediatelybegan a defence to which it is impossible to do justice soexuberantly did he suit the action to the word and theword to the action och your honour there is somethingthe matter with me he began at the same time putting twoof his fingers perpendicularly over his forehead tointimate that mrs sullivan played him false he then wentinto a long story about a misther burke who lodged in hishouse and had taken the liberty of assisting him in hisconjugal duties without any lave from him at all at allit was one night in particular he said that he went to bedbetimes in the little back parlour quite entirely sick withthe headache misther burke was out from home and when theshop was shut up mrs sullivan went out too but he didn'tmuch care for that only he thought she might as well havestaid at home and so he couldn't go to sleep for thinkingof it well at one o'clock in the morning he continuedlowerking his voice into a sort of loud whisper at oneo'clock in the mornking misther burke lets himself in withthe key that he had and goes up to bed and i thoughtnothing at all but presently i hears something come taptap tap at the street door the minute after comes downmisther burke and opens the door and sure it was marymistress sullivan that is more's the pity and devil a bitshe came to see after me at all in the little back parlourbut up stairs she goes after misther burke och says butthere's something the matter with me this night and i gotup with the nightcap o th head of me and went into theshop to see for a knife but i couldn't get one by no manesso i creeps up stairs step by step step by step heremr sullivan walked on tiptoe all across the office to showthe magistrate how quietly he went up the stairs and wheni gets to the top i sees em by the gash gas comingthrough the chink in the window curtains i sees em and'och mistress sullivan says he and och misther burkesays she and och botheration says i to myself and whatshall i do now we cannot follow mr sullivan any fartherin the detail of his melancholy affair it is sufficientthat he saw enough to convince him that he was dishonouredthat by some accident or other he disturbed the guiltypair whereupon mrs sullivan crept under mr burke's bedto hide herself that mr sullivan rushed into the room anddragged her from under the bed by her wicked leg andthat he felt about the round table in the corner where mrburke kept his bread and cheese in the hope of finding aknifeand what would you have done with it if you had found itasked his worshipis it what i would have done with it your honour asksexclaimed mr sullivan almost choked with rage is it whati would have done with it only that i'd have digged itinto the heart of em at the same time as he said this hethrew himself into an attitude of wild desperation and madea tremendous lunge as if in the very act of slaughterto make short of a long story he did not find the knifemr burke barricaded himself in his room and mr sullivanturned his wife out of doorsthe magistrate ordered him to find bail to keep the peacetowards his wife and all the king's subjects and told himthat if his wife was indeed what he had represented her tobe he must seek some less violent mode of separation thanthe knifethere not being any other case of interest tom and bob leftthe office not however without a feeling of commiserationfor mr sullivan whose frail rib and her companion ininiquity now that the tables were turned against them bythe injured husband's plain unvarnished tale experienceda due share of reprobation from the auditory pursuing their course homeward through st jamessquarewho have we here exclaimed tom as i live no other than thelofty honoris an authoress a wit and an eccentric a combinationof qualities which frequently contribute to convey the possessor to agarret and thence to an hospital or poor house it is not uncommon tofind attic salt in the first floor from heaven but rather difficultto find the occupier enabled to procure salt whereby to render porridgepalatable the lady honoris who has just passed resides in a lodgingin marylebone she having mistaken stature for beauty and attitudefor greatness a tune on her lute for fascination a few strangeopinions and out of the way sayings for genius a masculine appearancefor attraction and bulk for irresistibility came on a cruise to londonwith a view to call at c house where she conceived she might betreated like a princessshe fondly fancied that a certain dignified personage who relieved herdistress could not but be captivated with the very description of herin consequence of which she launched into expenses which she was butill able to bear and now complains of designs formed against her and ofall sorts of fabulous nonsense it must however be acknowledged thatan extraordinary taste for fat has been a great somce of inconvenienceto the illustrious character alluded to for corpulent women have beenin the habit of daily throwing themselves in his way under some pretenceor other and if he but looked at them they have considered themselvesas favourites and in the high road to riches and fameit is well known that a certain french woman with long flowing blackhair who lived not an hundred miles from publico was one who fell intothis error her weight is about sixteen stone and on that account shesets herself down as this illustrious person's mistress nay because hesaw her once she took expensive lodgings ran deeply in debt and nowabuses the great man because he has not provided for her in a princelystyle pour se beaux yeux for it must be admitted that she can boastas fine a pair of black eyes as ever were seen the circumstance ofthis taste for materialism is as unfortunate to the possessor as aconvulsive nod of the head once was to a rich gentleman who was neverwithout being engaged in some law suit or other for lots knocked downto him at auctions owing to his incessant and involuntary nodding atthese places the fat ladies wish the illustrious amateur to pay forpeeping just as the crafty knights of the hammer endeavoured to makethe rich gentleman pay for his nodding at themfat fair and forty then said sparkle does not appear to beforgotten no was the reply nor is it likely the wits of london areseldom idle upon subjects of importance take for instance the followinglineswhen first i met thee fat and fairwith forty charms about theea widow brisk and debonair how could i live without theethy roguish eye i quickly spiedit made me still the fonderi swore though false to all besidefrom thee i'd never wanderbut old fitly nowthought only fit to tease meand c m i vowhas learnt the art to please meby this time they were passing grosvenor gate when the hon tom dashalldirected the attention of his cousin to a person on the opposite side ofthe street pacing along with a stiff and formal airthat said he is a new species of character if it may properly beso termed of which i have never yet given you any account sir edwardknoweth stands however at the head of a numerous and respectable classof persons who may be entitled philosophic coxcombs he proceeds withgeometrical exactness in all his transactions you can perceive fineryof dress is no mark of his character on the contrary he at all timeswears a plain coat and as if in ridicule of the common fop takes careto decorate his menials in the most gorgeous liveriesthe stiffness and formality of his appearance is partly occasioned bythe braces which he very judiciously purchased of martin van butcherand partly by the pride of wealth and rankthere is a pensiveness in his aspect which would induce any one toimagine sir edward to be a man of feeling but those who have dependedupon outward appearances alone have found themselves miserablydeceived for as hypocrisy assumes a look of sanctity so yourphilosophic coxcomb's apparent melancholy serves only as a mask to coverhis stupiditysir edward is amorously inclined but he consults his reason orpretends to do so and by that means renders his pleasures subservientto his health it cannot be denied he sometimes manifests contortions ofaspect not exactly in unison with happiness but his feelings are everselfish and his apparent pain is occasioned by the nausea of a debauchor perhaps by the pressure of a new pair of boots if you are indistress sir edward hears your tale with the most stoical indifferenceand he contemplates your happiness with an equal degree of apathy asort of epictetus who can witness the miseries of a brother withoutagony or sympathy and mark the elevation of a friend without onesentiment of congratulation wrapt up in self he banishes all feelingfor others this philosopher has a great number of imitators perhaps notless than one thousand philosophic coxcombs visit london annually andif sir edward were to die they might all with great propriety lay claimto a participation in the property he might leave behind him as nearrelations to the family of the knolls these gentlemen violate all themoral duties of life with impunity they are shameless irreligiousand so insignificant that they seem to consider themselves born forno useful purpose whatever indeed they are such perfect blanks in thecreation that were they transported to some other place the communitywould never miss them except by the diminution of follies and viceslike poisonous plants they merely vegetate diffuse their contagiouseffluvia around then sink into corruption and are forgotten for everwhip me such fellows through the world exclaimed sparkle i have norelish for themon calling in at long's hotel they were informed that sparkle's servanthad been in pursuit of his master in consequence of letters havingarrived from the country and as dashall knew that he had two excellentreasons why he should immediately acquaint himself with their contentsthe party immediately returned to piccadillychapter xxvimark the change at very first vacationshe's scarcely known to father or relationno longer now in vesture neat and tightbecause forsooth she's learn'd to be politebut crop't a bosom bare her charms explodeher shape the tout ensemble alamode why bet cries pa what's come to thee of latethis school has turn'd thy brain as sure as fatewhat means these vulgar ways i hate em wenchyou shan't i tell thee imitate the frenchbecause great yokes adopt a foreign tasteand wear their bosoms naked to the waistd'ye think you shall no no i loathe such waysmercy great notes shew all for nothing now daysthe morning arose with smiles and sunshine which appeared almost toinvite our party earlier than they intended to the enjoyments of a planwhich had occupied their attention on the previous evening when sparkleproposed a ride which being consented to the horses were prepared andthey were quickly on the roadpassing through somers town sparkle remarked to his friend dashallthat he could not help thinking that the manners and information of therising generation ought to be greatly improvedand have you not had sufficient evidence of the fact was the replywhy certainly continued sparkle if the increase of public schoolsround the metropolis is in proportion to what has already met myeye during our present short ride there is sufficient evidence thateducation is considered as it ought to be of the first importance yeti question whether we are so much more learned than our ancestors asto require such a vast increase of teachers nay is not the marketoverstocked with these heads of seminaries similar to the republic ofletters which is overwhelmed with authors and clogged with bookmakersand books this remark replied tom might almost as well be made uponevery trade and profession which is followed in the present day thereare so many in each that a livelihood can scarcely be obtained and auniversal grumbling is the consequencewell said bob i can with safety say there are but two trades orcallings that i have met with since my arrival in london to which ihave discovered no rivalshipthis remark from tallyhoho excited some surprise in the mind of his twofriends who were anxious to know to what he alludedi mean continued he the doll's bedstead seller who is frequentlyto be heard in the street of london bawling with a peculiarity ofvoice as singular as the article he has for sale buy my doll'sbedsteads and the other a well known whistler whom you must bothhave heardegad you are right replied sparkle and although i recollect themboth i must confess the observation now made has never so forciblystruck me before it however proves you have not exhausted your timein town without paying attention to the characters it contains nor thecircumstances by which they obtain their livelihood and althoughthe introduction is not exactly in point with the subject of previousremarks and ought not to cut the thread of our discourse it has somereference and conveys to my mind a novel piece of information but iwas about to consider what can be the causes for this extraordinaryhost of ladies of all ages classes and colours from the honourablemistress to the misses stubbs who have their establishment forthe education of young ladies in a superior style and whether inconsequenceof this legion of fair labourers in learning and scienceour countrywomen for i am adverting particularly to the softer sex arechaster wiser and better than their mammas and grandmammasa most interesting subject truly replied tom and well worthy ofclose investigation now for my part i apprehend that the increase oftutors arises from many other causes than the more general diffusion ofknowledge there can be no doubt of it continued sparkle and someof those causes are odd enough very opposite to wisdom and not moreconducive to improvement for amongst them you will find pride povertyand idlenessfor instance you may discover that the proud partner of a shopkeeperin the general line or more plainly speaking the proprietor of achandler's shop is ambitious of having her daughter accomplishede'en good geoffrey forge a blacksmith by descentwho has his life midst bars and hammers spentresolves his bet shall learn to read and writeand grace his table with a wit politeto make for father's sense a reparationthe day arrives for fatal separationwhen betsey quits her dad with tears of woeand goes to boardingschool at publicowell the accomplishments sought are music dancing french andornamental work instead of learning the bible being brought up todomestic utility cooking washing plain work and the arithmeticnecessary for keeping the accounts of her father's shop what is theconsequence the change in her education quite unfits miss for herstation in life makes her look down on her unlettered pa and ma aspersons too ignorant for her to associate with while she is lookingup with anxious expectation to marry a man of fortune probably anofficer and is not unfrequently taken unceremoniously without theconsent of her parents on a visit to the churchyou are pushing the matter as close as you can charles said dashallthough i confess i think nay i may say indeed i know some instancesin which such fatal consequences have been the result of the conduct towhich you alludewell then suppose even that this superior style of education shouldnot have the effect of turning the poor girl's head and that she reallyhas prudence and discretion enough to avoid the perils and snares ofambition miss celestina is at least unfitted for a tradesman's wifeand she must either become a companion or a governess or a teacherat a school or be set up as the minerva of an evening school halfeducated herself and exposed in every situation for which she isconceived to be fitted to numerous temptations betwixt the teachersof waltzes and quadrilles the one horse chaise dancingmasters thelaxmorale foreign musicmaster or the dashing pa of her young pupilsperhaps a peer celibacy is not always so much an affair of choice asof circumstances and sad difficulties are consequently thrown in theway of poor miss so and so's path through life all originating frompride well said bob since you have been amusing us withthis description i have counted not less than eight seminariesestablishments and preparatory schoolsi do not doubt it continued sparkle and some of them on the meanestscale notwithstanding the high sounding titles under which they areintroduced to public notice others presided over by sister spinstersnot unfrequently with frenchified names such for instance as'mesdames guerdon's seminary the lady's real name being martha orif you please patty burton and a deformed relative completingthe mesdames the misses de la porte whom nature had made simpleporter and no great catch to obtain either the misses cox'spreparatory school for young gentlemen of an early age all seemto bespeak the poverty false pride and affectation of the ownersnotwithstanding the fine denominations given to some of these learnedinstitutions such as bellevue seminary montpelier house belretiro boarding school c cto such artifices as these are two classes of females compelled toresort namely reduced gentlewomen and exalted tradesmen's daughterswho disdain commerce and hate the homely station which dame nature hadoriginally intended them to move in such ladies either by birth oradoption prefer the twig to the distaff the study to the shop andexperience more pleasure in walking out airing with their pupils takingtheir station in the front frequently gaudily and indiscreetly dressedthan to be confined to the counter or the domestic occupations of thegood old english housewife of former timessuch ladies are frequently to be met with on all the greens andcommons from dirty stephen or retinal to the more sumptuous clapham orwollaston some of them are so occupied with self that the randomshotglances of their pupils at the exquisite and the dandy militaires abouttown do not come within the range of their notice while others aremore vigilant but often heave a sigh at the thought that the gay andgallant captain should prefer the ruddy daughter of a cheesemonger tothe reduced sprigs of gentility which they consider themselves at all events many of these ladies and worthy ones too areplaced par force of poverty in this avocation unsuited to theirabilities their hearts their habits or their former expectations thegovernment of their young flock is odious to them and although they maygo through the duties of their situation with apparent patience it isin fact a drudgery almost insupportable and the objects nearest thegoverness's heart are the arrival of the vacation the entrancemoneythe quarter's schooling and a lengthy list of items the arrival ofblack monday or a cessation of holidays brings depressed spirits andshe returns to her occupation deploring her unlucky stars which placedher in so laborious a situation envies her cousin sarah who hascaught a minor in her net nay even perhaps would be happy to exchangecircumstances with the thoughtless miss skipwell who has run away withher dancingmaster or ruined a young clergyman of a serious turn byaddressing loveletters to him copied from the most romantic novelswhich have softened his heart into matrimony and made genteel beggarsof the reverend mistress himself and a numerous offspringvery agreeable indeed cried dashallperhaps not said tallyhoho interrupting him to the partiesdescribedyou mistake me was the reply i meant the combination of air andexercise with the excellent descriptions of our friend sparkle who bythe way has not yet done with the subjecti am aware of it continued sparkle for there is one part which imentioned at the outset which may with great propriety be added in theway of elucidation i mean idleness it is the third and shall forthe present be the last subject of our consideration and even this hascontributed its fair proportion of teachers to the world miss mel taway the daughter of a tallowchandler who ruined himself by dressingextravagantly his wife and over educating his dear caroline matildain consequence of which he failed and shortly afterwards left the worldaltogether was brought up in the straw line but this was no solidtrade and could not be relied upon however she plays upon the harpand the guitar what advantages yet she also failed in the strawhatline and therefore idleness prefers becoming an assistant teacherand music mistress to taking to any more laborious even though moreproductive mode of obtaining a livelihood then miss nugent has a few hundred pounds the remnant ofpa's gleanings pa having been the retired butler of a pigeons peer aretail bookseller sought her hand in marriage but she thought himquite a vulgar fellow he had no taste for waltzing at which she wasconsidered to excel he blamed her indulgence in such pleasures

lettersannouncing miss smallgood's establishment for young ladies and closealongside of it another informing the passenger that mantraps wereplaced in the premisesi did said sparkle but i do not think that though somewhatcurious the most remarkable or strange association young ladieseducated on an improved plan and mantraps advertised in order tocreate terror and dismay for connected with this method of announcingplaces of education is a recollection of receptacles of anothernatureto what do you allude inquired tallyhoho why in many instancesprivate madhouses are disguised as boarding schools under thedesignation of establishment many of these receptacles in thevicinity of the metropolis are rendered subservient to the veryworst of purposes though originally intended for the safety of theindividual as well as the security of the public against the commissionof acts which are too frequently to be deplored as the effect ofinsanity of all the houses of mourning that to which poor unhappymortals are sent under mental derangement is decidedly the most gloomythe idea strikes the imagination with horror which is considerablyincreased by a reflection on the numerous human victims that areincarcerated within their walls the discipline they are subjectedto and the usual pecuniary success which attends the keepers of suchestablishments where the continuance of the patient is the chiefsource of interest rather than the recovery that they are usefulin some cases cannot be denied but there are many instances too wellauthenticated to be doubted where persons desirous of getting rid ofaged and infirm relatives particularly if they manifested any littleaberration of mind as is common in advanced age have consigned themto these receptacles from which through the supposed kindness oftheir friends and the management of the proprietors they have neverreturned if the parties ail nothing they are soon driven to insanityby ill usage association with unfortunates confined like themselvesvexation at the treatment and absolute despair of escape or ifpartially or slightly afflicted the lucid intervals are preventedand the disorder by these means is increased and confirmed by coercionirritation of mind and despair this is a deplorable picture of the state of things indeedsaid tallyhohobut it is unvarnished was the reply the picture requires noimaginary embellishment since it has its foundation in truth thenagain contrast the situation of the confined with the confined therelatives have an interest in the care of the person and a control overthe property which in cases of death frequently becomes their ownthe keepers of these receptacles have also an interest in keeping therelatives in a disposition to forward all their views of retaining thepatient who under the representation of being seriously deranged isnot believed consequently all is delusion but the advantages whichultimately fall to the tenderhearted relative or the more artfulproprietor of the madhouse and it is wonderful what immense fortunesare made by the latter nay not only by the proprietors but eventhe menials in their employ many of whom have been known to retireindependent a circumstance which clearly proves that by some means orother they must have possessed themselves of the care of the propertyas well as that of the persons of their unfortunate victimsthis is a dull subject said dashall though i confess that someexposures which have been made fully justify your observations but i amnot fond of looking at such gloomy pictures of real lifetrue replied sparkle but it connects itself with the object youhave had in view and though i know there are many who possess soulsof sensibility and who would shrink from the contemplation of so muchsuffering humanity it is still desirable they should know the effectsproduced almost by inconceivable causes i know people in general avoidthe contemplation as well as fly from the abodes of misery contentingthemselves by sending pecuniary assistance but unfortunately thereare a number of things that wear a similarity of appearance yet are sounlike in essence and reality that they are frequently mistaken by thecredulous and unwary who become dupes merely because they are not eyewitnessesof the facts but if the subject is dull let us push forwardtake a gallop over hampstead heath and return with all my heart cried dashall giving a spur to his horseand away they wentthe day was delightfully fine the appearance of the country banishedall gloomy thoughts from their minds and after a most agreeable ridethey returned to piccadilly where finding dinner ready they spentthe remainder of the evening in the utmost hilarity and the mutualinterchange of amusing and interesting conversation

this sublunarysphere and hear him with his expiring breath say all is thine anda letter to each of his former friends announced the pleasure andthe happiness he should experience by an early visit to

the plan he intended to pursuetallyhoho confessed himself tired of this world of wonders and appearedto be actuated by a similar feeling he conceived he had seen enough ofthe life of a rover and seemed to sigh for his native plains again dashall's relish for novelty in london was almost subdued andafter comparing notes together for a short time it was mutually agreedthat they would dine quietly at home and digest a plan for futureproceedingsnever said tom did i feel so strong an inclination to foregothe fascinating charms of a london life as at the present momentand whether i renounce it altogether or not we will certainly pay acongratulatory visit to merry wellexample said sparkle endeavouring to encourage the feeling withwhich his friend's last sentiment was expressed is at all times betterthan precept and retirement to domestic felicity is preferable torevelry in splendid scenes of dissipation which generally leads topremature dissolutionagreed said tom and happy is the man who like yourself has morethan self to think for blest with a lovely and amiable wife and anample fortune no man upon earth can have a better chance of glidingdown the stream of life surrounded by all the enjoyments it canafford while i oh what a lost mutton am isparkle could scarcely forbear laughing at his friend though he wasunable to discover whether he was speaking seriously or ironically hetherefore determined to rally him a littlehow said he why you are growing serious and sentimental all atonce what can be the cause of this change of opinion so suddenlymy views of life replied dashall have been sufficient to convinceme that a like in london is the high road to death i have howevertried its vagaries in all companies in all quarters and as the songsayshaving sown my wild oats in my youthful days i wish to live happilynow they are doneby this time sparkle was convinced that dashall was speaking the realsentiments of his mind and congratulated him upon them tallyhoho expressed himself highly delighted with the informationhe had acquired during his stay in london but could not help at thesame time acknowledging that he had no wish to continue in the samecourse much longer it was therefore agreed that on that day fortnightthey would leave the metropolis for the residence of merrywell andtrust the future guidance of their pursuits to chanceit would argue a want of loyalty said tom if we did not witness theroyal departure for scotland before we quit town and as that is to takeplace on saturday next we will attend the embarkation of his majesty atgreenwich and then turn our thoughts towards a country lifesparkle was evidently gratified by this determination though he couldhardly persuade himself it was likely to be of long duration and bobinwardly rejoiced at the expression of sentiments in exact accordancewith his own at a moment when they were all absorbed in thoughts ofthe future they were suddenly drawn to the present by a man passing thewindow bawling aloud buy a pray buy a praywhat does the fellow mean interrupted tallyhohomean said dashall nothing more than to sell his clothes propsprops replied bob but he cries traps i suppose that is a new styleadopted in londonnot at all continued sparkle the alteration of sound only arisesfrom an habitual carelessness with which many of what are termed thelondon cries are given a sort of tone or jargon which is acquired bycontinually calling the same thing and in which you will find he isnot singular the venders of milk for instance seldom call the articlethey carry for sale as it is generally sounded mien or mien below though some have recently adopted the practice of crying mien above the sort of singsong style which the wandering venders of differentgoods get into as it were by nature is frequently so unintelligiblethat even an old inhabitant of the town and its environs can scarcelyascertain by the ear what is meant and which i apprehend arises morefrom the sameness of subject than from any premeditated intention of theparties so calling other instances may be given the chimneysweeperyou will find instead of bawling sweep frequently contractsit to weep or eep the former not altogether incompatible with thesituation of the shivering little being who crawls along the streetsunder a load of soot to the great annoyance of the well dressedpassengers however it has the effect of warning them of his approachthe fustian above curtailment as if he felt his superiority over thefluemaker lengthens his sound to dustho or dustwo besides he isdignified by carrying a bell in one hand by which he almost stunsthose around him and appears determined to kick up a dust if he cando nothing else the cries of muffins in the streets it is difficultto understand as they are in the habit of ringing a tinkling bellthe sound of which can scarcely be heard and calling mapping ho andi remember one man whom i have frequently followed from whom i couldnever make out

those previously mentioned as they have good voicesand deliver themselves to some tune but to the former may be addedthe itinerant collector of old clothes who continually annoys youwith chow chow sale the ingenious ned shute the most luxuriantcomedian of his time frequently entertained his audience on his benefitnights with admirable imitations of the cries of london in which heintroduced a remarkable little man who sold puffs and who from thepeculiar manner of his calling them acquired the name of golly mollypuff by this singularity he became a noted character and at almostevery period some such peculiar itinerant has become remarkable in thestreets of london some years back a poor wretched being who dealt inshreds and patches used to walk about inviting people by the followinglineslinen woollen and leatherbring em out altogether another a sleekheaded whimsical old man appeared who wascommonly called the wooden poet from his carrying wooden ware whichwas slung in a

warevery well indeed for a wooden poet exclaimed bois he certainlydeserved custom at all events his rivals walter scott or lord byronwould have turned such a poetical effusion to some account it wouldhave been dramatized murray hangman c would have been all in abustle puffing blowing and advertising we should have had piracieschancery injunctions and the d to pay but alas it makes allthe difference whether a poet is fashionable and popular or not lord byron in his preface to a recent publicationcomplains that among other black arts resorted to for thepurpose of injuring his fair fame he has been accused ofreceiving considerable sums for writing poetical puffs forwarren's blacking we can safely acquit his lordship of thischarge as well as of plagiarism from the poems he alludesto but it has led to a curious rencontre between theblackinglaureat and his patron the vender of the shinkingjet and after considerable blackguardian between theparties the matter is likely to become the subject of legaldiscussion among the gentlemen of the black robethe poet it appears received half a crown for eachproduction from the man of blacking which the latterconsidered not only a fair but even liberal remunerationfor poetic talent not overlookking that while thepecuniary reward would produce comfort and add a polish topersonal appearance the brilliance of the compositionboth of poetry and blacking would be fairly dividedbetween he authors of each and that the fame of both wouldbe conjointlyhanded down to posterity and shine for ever in the templeof famenow it requires no uncommon sagacity to perceive that butfor this unfortunate mistake of the public the poet wouldhave remained satisfied as far as pecuniary recompencewent with the halfcrown looking to futurity for thatmore complete recompence which poets ever consider farbeyond pudding or sensual gratification fame andimmortality but alasfrom causes quite obscure and unforeseen what great eventsto man may sometimes springfinding from lord bs own statement that the public hadduly appreciated the merit of these compositions and hadattached so high a value as even to mistake them for hislordship's productions our bard was naturally led into atrain of reasoning and logical deductions as to whatadvantage had and what ought to have resulted to himselfaccording to this estimate by public opinion lord b andhis great northern contemporary it appeared receivedthousands from the public for their poems while halfcrownsnot to be despised during certain cravings but soondissipated by that insatiable and unceasing tormentor thestomach was all the benefit likely to accrue in this worldto the original proprietor in a happy moment a happythought flitted athwart the poet's mind and like the chinaseller in the arabian nights he found himself rolling inideal wealth and spurning with disdain the blackingmerchant the blacking and the halfcrowns he resolved ona project by which to realize his fondest wishes of wealthhappiness and independencethe project was this to collect together the fugitiveblacking sonnets so as to form a volume under the title ofpoems supposed to be written by lord byron and offer thecopyright to mr murray and in case of his refusing aliberal sum that is something approaching to what hepays the noble bard per vol to publish them on his theauthor's own account and depend on the public for thatsupport and encouragement which their favourable decisionhad already rendered pretty certainnow then comes the rub the blacking vender hearing ofour poet's intention files a bill in chancery praying foran injunction to restrain the publication and claiming anexclusive right in the literary property the poet inreplication denies having assigned or transferred thecopyright and thus issue is joined his lordship with hisusual extreme caution where important rights are involvedwished to give the matter mature consideration and saidhe would take the papers home to peruse more attentivelyit will be recollected that in the cause respecting lordbyron's poem of cain his lordship stated that during thevacation he had by way of relaxation from business perusedthat work and paradise lost in order to form a justestimate of their comparative merits and who knows butduring the present vacation his lordship may compare theblacking sonnets with child harold fare thee wellc and that on next seal day the public may be benefitedby his opinion as to which is entitled to the claim ofsuperior excellence and how far the public are justified inattributing the former to the noble author of the latter then continued sparkle there was a rustic usually mountedon a white hobby with a basket on one arm who used to invade thenorthern purlieus of london mumbling holloway cheesecakes which fromhis mode of utterance sounded like ho all my teeth akeha ha ha vociferated tallyhoho unable to restrain his risibilitynumerous other instances might be adduced continued sparkle amongmany there was a noted pitman whose pigs were made of what is calledstanding crust three or four inches long baked with currant sauce inthe belly who used to cry or rather singa long tail'd pig or a short tail'd pig cthere was another singular character who used to be called teddydolla noted vender of gingerbread at bartholomew southwark and otherfairs who to collect customers round his

aspect and as it had beenpreviously rumoured that his majesty would embark from greenwichhospital at halfpast eight o'clock on his intended voyage to scotlandour party had arranged every thing for their departure at an early hourand before seven o'clock had seated themselves in a commodious andelegant barge moored off westminster bridge intending if possible tosee the city companies headed by the lord mayor and court of aldermenstart as had been proposed from the tower they were shortlyafterwards gliding on the surface of the watery element towards thescene of action by this time the numerous parties in pursuit of thesame object were on the alert and from almost every part of the shoreas they passed along gaily dressed company was embarking while merrypeals of bells seemed to announce approaching delight the steeples onshore and the vessels in the river exhibited flags and streamerswhich gave an additional splendour to the scene all was anxiety andexpectation numerous barges and pleasureboats laden with elegantcompany were speeding the same way and every moment increasing sothat the whole view displayed a combination of beauty fashion andloyalty not often surpassed on arriving off the tower it was soon ascertained thatthe lord mayor and city companies had got the start of them andconsequently they proceeded on their journey not doubting but theyshould overtake them before reaching greenwich and in this expectationthey were not disappointed for soon after passing rotherhithe churchthey came up with the city state barge which was towed by a steamboataccompanied by several other state barges the whole filled withcompany the brightness of the morning and the superb appearance ofthese gaily manned and it might be added gaily woman gallies foranumerous party of fashionably attired ladies added their embellishingpresence to the spectacle formed altogether a picture of more thanordinary interest and magnificencethis royal visit to scotland said sparkle has for some time pastbeen a prevailing topic of discussion from one end of the land of cakesto the other and the preparations for his majesty's reception are ofthe most splendid description triumphal arches are to be erected newroads to be made banquets to be given general illuminations to takeplace body guards of royal archers to be appointed and the dull lightof oil lamps to be totally obscured by the full blaze of royal gas thenthere are to be meetings of the civil and municipal authorities fromevery town and county presenting loyal and dutiful addresses and it isexpected that there will be so much booing among the carle's when theking's come that the oilier are said to be not a whit disconcerted atthe introduction of gas lights the unctuous article being at presentin great demand for the purpose of suppling the stiff joints of thewouldbe courtiers who have resolved to give a characteristic specimenof their humble loyalty and to oulboo all the hoping of the famed sirpertinaxhowever observed dashall it is not very likely they will be able toequal the grace with which it is acknowledged the king can bow and heis to be accompanied by the accomplished sir billy of city notorietyso that admirable examples are certain of being presented to thescottish gentry reports state that the worthy baronet whois considered to be of great weight wherever he goes is determinedto afford his majesty in this visit to edinburgh the benefit of thatpreponderating loyalty which he last year threw into the scale of thedublin corporation and that he has recently purchased from a highlandtailor in the hay market a complete suit of tartan philebeg c withwhich he means to invest himself as the appropriate costume to meethis royal master on his arrival at edinburghin that case said sparkle there is one circumstance greatly to beregretted considering the gratification which our northern neighboursmight have derived from ascertaining the precise number of cats of themost weighty of london citizens i remember reading a day or two backthat the weighhouse of the city of edinburgh was disposed of by publicroup and that a number of workmen were immediately employed to take itdown as the whole must be cleared away by the th of august under apenalty of l what a pity that in the annals of the weighhouse thescotch could not have registered the actual weight of the greatest oflondon aldermentom and bob laughed heartily at their friend sparkle's anticipationsrespecting the worthy baronet while bob dryly remarked he shouldthink sir willie would prove himself a bonnie lad among the lasses oand nae doubt he would cut a braw figure in his highland suitbut continued dashall we are indulging in visions of fancy withoutpaying that attention to the scene around us which it deserves and iperceive we are approaching greenwich hospital there is the royal yachtready prepared for the occasion the shores are already crowded withcompany and the boats and barges are contending for eligible situationsto view the embarkation there is the floating chapel and a littlefurther on to the right is the marine society's schoolship for theeducation of young lads for his majesty's service the hospital nowpresents a grand and interesting appearance what say you suppose weland at the three crowns and make inquiry as to the likely time of hismajesty's departurewith all my heart replied sparkle and we can then refresh for i amnot exactly used to water excursions and particularly so early in themorning consequently it has a good effect on the appetite by this time the city barges had taken positions in the frontof the hospital and our party passed them to gain the proposed placeof inquiry here however all was conjecture the people of greenwichhospital appeared to know as little of the time appointed as those ofthe metropolis and finding they had little chance of accommodation inconsequenceof the great influx of company they again embarkedand shortly after attacked the produce of their locker and with anexcellent tongue and a glass of madeira regaled themselves sufficientlyto wait the arrival time however hung heavily on their hands thoughthey had a view of thousands much worse situated than themselvesand could only contemplate the scene with astonishment that seriousmischiefs did not accrue from the immense congregated multitude bywhich they were surroundedanxiety and anticipation were almost exhausted and had nearly givenplace to despondency when about three o'clock the extraordinary bustleon shore announced the certainty of the expected event being about totake place and in about half an hour after they were gratified byseeing his majesty descend the steps of the hospital attended by thenoblemen c under a royal salute and rowed to the vessel prepared toreceive him the royal standard was immediately hoisted and away sailedthe king amidst the heartfelt congratulations and good wishes of hisaffectionate and loyal people the firing of cannon the ringing ofbells and every other demonstration of a lively interest in his safetyand welfare leaving many to conjecture the feelings with which theheart must be impressed of a person so honoured and attended we shallselect a few descriptive lines from the pen of a literary gentlemanin his opinion the most likely to be expressive of the

animated appearanceof the river which by this time seemed all in motion amply repaid ourfriends for the time they had waited and after watching the departureof the royal squadron they returned to town and as they passed thelondon docks it occurred to the mind of the hon tom dashall that hiscousin had not yet paid a visit to these highly interesting productionsof human genius and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to theirinspection before his departure from the metropolischapter xxixwhere has commerce such a martso rich so throng'd so drained and so suppliedas london opulent enlarged and stillincreasing london babylon of oldnot more the glory of the earth than shea more accomplish'd world's chief glory nowaccording to arrangements previously made our friends met in themorning with a determination to shape their course eastward in order totake a survey of the commercial docks for the accommodation of shippingand the furtherance of trade and the carriage being ordered they werequickly on their way towards blackwellthe docks of the port of london said the hon tom dashall are ofthe highest importance in a commercial point of view and are among theprominent curiosities of british commerce as they greatly facilitatetrade and afford additional security to the merchantsyes said sparkle and it is to be presumed no small profit to theshareholders of the companies by which they were established but iexpect your cousin will derive more gratification from a sight of theplaces themselves than from any description we can give and thetime to explain will be when we arrive on the spot for it is scarcelypossible for any one to conceive the immensity of buildings theycontain or the regularity with which the business is carried on howdo ye do thrusting his head out of the window and moving his handwith graceful familiarity i have not seen sir frederick since mymatrimonial trip and now he has passed by on horseback i really believewithout seeing me dashall you remember sir frederick forfeitperfectly well replied tom but i was paying so much attention toyou that i did not notice him the liveliest fellow except yourselfin the whole round of my acquaintance and you are one of the best i ever met with to gain a point bya good turn but take it and make the most you can of it i may have anopportunity of paying you off in your own cointallyhoho laughed heartily at the manner in which sparkle had altogetherchanged the conversation but could not help remarking that sirfrederick had not given a specimen of his politeness by avoiding areturn of sparkle's salutationand yet continued sparkle he is one of the most polished men iknow notwithstanding i think his upper story is not a bit too wellfurnished he has a handsome fortune and a pretty wife who wouldindeed be a lovely woman but for an affectation of manners which sheassumed upon coming to the title of lady forfeit their parties are ofthe most dashing order and all the rank and fashion of the metropolisvisit their mansionsparkle who was in his usual humour for conversation and descriptionnow entertained his friends with the following account of a party withwhom he had spent an evening just previous to his departure from townmrs stepswift is the widow lady of a dancingmaster who havingacquired some little property previous to his decease left his partnerin possession of his wealth and two daughters though the provision fortheir education and support was but scanty the mother had the good lucka few years after to add to her stock ten thousand pounds by a prize inthe lottery a circumstance which afforded her additional opportunitiesof indulging her passion for dress which she did not fail to inculcatein her daughters who though not handsome were rather pleasing andagreeable girls and since the good fortune to which i have alluded shehas usually given a ball by way of introduction to company and with theprobable view as they are now marriageable to secure them husbandsit was on one of these occasions that i was invited and as i knewbut one of the party i had an excellent opportunity of making myuninterrupted remarksthen said dashall i'll wager my life you acted the part of anobservant quizand i should think you would be likely to win observed tallyhoho i am bound to consider myself obliged continued sparklefor the bold construction you are kind enough to put upon my characterand conduct by your observations but never mind i am not to beintimidated by the firing of a popgun or a flash in the pan thereforei shall proceed upon my introduction i found the widow playing a rubberwith a punchy parson a lean doctor and a halfpay officer in theguards and consequently taking a friend i knew by the arm i strolledthrough the rooms which were spacious and well furnished in theballroom i found numerous couples tripping it on the light fantastictoe to the tune of i'll gang no more to yon town and displayinga very considerable portion of grace and agility in the other roomdevoted to refreshments and cards i met with several strollers likemyself who being without partners or not choosing to dance with suchas they could obtain were lounging away their time near the centre ofthe room i was introduced to the two young ladies who behaved with theutmost politeness and attention though i could easily perceive therewas a considerable portion of affectation mingled with their mannersand i soon discovered that they operated as the loadstone of attractionto several dandylike beaux who were continually flocking around themmy dear miss eliza said a pugnosed dandy whom i afterwardsunderstood to be a jeweller's showman may i be allowed the superlativehonor and happiness of attending you down the next dance the manner inwhich this was spoken with a drawling lisp and the unmeaning attitudeof the speaker which was any thing but natural provoked my risibilityalmost beyond forbearance his bushy head the fall of his cape and theawkward stickout of his coat which was buttoned tight round his waistthe drop of his quizzing glass from his bosom and the opera hat in hishand formed altogether as curious a figure as i ever recollect to haveseen though my eyes were immediately directed to another almost asgrotesque by the young lady herself who informed the applicant thatshe had engaged herself with captain scrambled and could not availherself of his intended honor while the captain himself with a mincinggait little compatible with the line of life to which it was to bepresumed he was attached was advancing and eyeing the wouldbe rivalwith all the apparent accuracy of a milhaving satisfied themselves by looking over these extensive works mrm informed them that adjoining the docks was a shipbuilding yardformerly well known as perry's yard but now the property of sir robertwigwam probably you would like to take a view round itto this having replied in the affirmative they were quickly introducedsir robert said mr m has been and i believe

fromperseverance and the active exercise of an intelligent mindhis first wife continued the informant died in the year leaving him five children and in the following year he married misseleanor watts daughter of john watts esq of southampton many yearssecretary to the victualling office who is the present lady wigwamthe benevolence of whose heart and gentleness of manners have not onlyendeared her

progenythey are however all of them well provided for and sir robert hasthe happiness at an advanced age to find himself the father of ahappy family he rejoices once a year to have them all seated at hisown table and has in many instances surprised his friends by anintroduction it is related that a gentleman from the isle of wightmet him near the exchange and after mutual salutations were passed heinvited the gentleman to dine with him by whom an excuse was offeredas he was not equipped for appearing at his table nonsense said sirrobert you must dine with me and i can assure you there will beonly my own family present so come along guess the surprise of hisvisitor on being introduced to a large party of ladies and gentlemenhe was confused and embarrassed he begged pardon and would haveretired declaring that sir robert had informed him that none but hisown family were to be present this sir r affirmed he had strictlyadhered to and introduced his friend to his sons and daughters by namewhich it may fairly be presumed though it explained did not exactlytend to decrease his visitor's embarrassmentand these premises inquired bob belong to the man you havedescribedthe same said mr m they are managed and conducted under thesuperintendence of two of his sons here east india ships are builtlaunched and repaired there are two on the stocks now of considerablemagnitude the premises are extensive and commodious and that highbuilding which you see is a masthouse and the other buildings aboutthe yard are devoted to sail lofts and shops for the various artizansrequisite to complete the grand design of building and fittingout a ship for sea from this yard you have a fine view over the marshestowards woolwich and also a commanding prospect of greenwich hospitalthe various vessels and boats passing and repassing at all times givevariety to the scene before you and when a launch takes place thewhole neighbourhood represents something of the nature of a carnivalthe river is covered with boats filled with company and every part ofthe shore near the spot from which the magnificent piece of mechanism isto burst upon its native element is equally occupied temporarybooths are erected upon each side of what is termed the cradle for theaccommodation of invited visitors bands play as she moves and a bottleof wine is thrown at her head as she glides from the stocks when hername is pronounced amidst the universal shouts of huzzait must be a most gratifying sight observed bob to see her cleavethe watery world indeed it is a very pleasing view we have alreadyhad of these floating castles though i must also remark that yourdescriptions have added greatly to the enjoyment and i think we aremuch indebted for your kindnessthey now parted with mr m and after refreshing with a glass of wineand a sandwich at the plough they proceeded to the west india docksthe entrance to which required no introduction here said dashallyou will find a much longer space occupied than at the east indiadocks these were undertaken according to an act of parliament passedin and the place was formerly called the isle of dogs though itmight almost as appropriately have been called the isle of boys uponthe wharfs and quays adjoining all west india ships unload and loadtheir cargoesand exclusively i suppose interrogated tallyhoho for theaccommodation of west india shippingexactly so continued tom the west india trade generally arrives infleets and formerly used to create much crowding confusion and damagein the river but these ships being now disposed of in the docks theovergrown trade of the port is carried on with pleasure and conveniencefor notwithstanding they have occasioned a very important trade tobe removed to a considerable and even inconvenient distance from themetropolis yet the advantages to the port of london are upon the wholeincalculable the northern dock for unloading inwards is by feet and feet deep covering a space of acres and capableof containing from two to three hundred sail of vessels in greatersecurity than the river could afford them and the west india dockcompany are reimbursed for the accommodation by a tonnage of s uponthe burthen of every ship which enters the docks besides which they areentitled to charge for wharfage landing housing weighing cooperageand warehouse room certain rates upon all goods that are dischargedsuch as d per cwt upon sugar d per gallon upon rum is d percwt upon coffee s d per cwt upon cotton wool c and all thisimmense business is conducted with a general order and regularity whichgreatly facilitates the business of the merchantbut said sparkle i apprehend it subjects him to something more ofexpense than he incurred by the former mode of proceedingi am not able decidedly to answer continued tom but in the main iexpect that if so it is well worth what is paid to have the additionalsecurity the forms of conducting the business may sometimes be attendedwith considerable trouble but there are persons so well acquainted withthem by habitual practice that there cannot be much difficulty at thisperiod this is the export dock which covers an area of acres andis by feet and deep the immense buildings round the twodocks are warehouses for the reception of goods and are of the mostsubstantial description and to enable shipping in their passage up anddown the thames to avoid the circuitous and inconvenient course roundthe isle of dogs a canal has been cut across this peninsula throughwhich upon paying certain moderate rates all ships vessels andcraft are permitted to pass in their passage up and down the riverin seeing this and tient date having beenmade use of even by the romans and not many years back a bush of ivyor a bunch of grapes was used for the purpose nay to the present daythey may be met with in many places the bush is perhaps one of themost ancient of publichouse signs which gave rise to the wellknownproverbgood wine needs no bushthat is to say it requires nothing to point out where it is soldat country fairs you will frequently see the houses in its vicinitydecorated with a bush or a bough from which they are termed boughhouses where accommodation may be found this practice i know isstill in use at boroughbridge in yorkshire during their annual fair injune which lasts a week or ten days but putting up boughs as a sign ofany thing to be sold was not confined to alehouses for in old timessuch as sold horses were wont to put flowers or boughs upon their headsto reveal that they were vendible in all probability from this practice originated the wellknown proverbas fine as a horsean illustration of which from the life of mrswilmington is here subjoinedthey took places in the waggon for chester and quittedlondon early on may morning and it being the custom on thefirst of this month to give the waggoner at every inn aribbon to adorn his team she soon discovered the origin ofthe proverb as fine as a horse for before they got tothe end of the journey the poor beasts were almost blindedby the tawdry partycoloured flowing honours of theirheads in scotland a wisp of straw upon a pole is or was some yearsago the indication of an alehouse and to this day a ship or vessel forsale may be discovered by a birch broom at the mast head i rememberreading that in fleet market on the eastern side there were somesmall houses with a sign post representing two hands conjoined withwords marriages performed within written beneath them whilst a dirtyfellow assailed the ears of the passengers with the reiterated and loudaddress of sir will you walk in and be married as if the dread ofany stoppage in the trade of conjugality was threatening mankind withpremature extinction and the parson was seen walking before his shopready to couple you for a dram of gin or a roll of tobaccothose were the times for getting married exclaimed bob noaffidavits certificates and exposures at church doorsno continued sparkle those are signs of altered times a wittywigmaker adopted the sign of absalom hanging to a tree with king davidlamenting at a distance who was represented with a label issuing fromhis mouth containing these wordso absalom my son my sonhad'st thou a peruke worn thou had'st not been undonethis sign if i remember right was to be seen a few years since inunionstreet borough and is not uncommon even now in france where youmay also find the cochon sans tete the pig without a head which isgenerally a restaurateur's sign indicating that good pork is here theuseless animal's head is off illustrative of the negro's

onlygentleman in england the conversation increased in interest as they proceeded andtallyhoho was all attention for it must be observed that as his inquiryhad occasioned it he was willing to listen to all that could beadvanced on the subject and the hon tom dashall determined to have hisshare in the explanationthe man in the moon said he is derived from the old observationthat a tipsy person is in the wind or in the moon a lunatic thesign may therefore be thought to give this advice here is good drinkgentlemen walk in and taste it it will make you as happy as the man inthe moon that is to say steep your senses in forgetfulness thebag of nails was the sign of an inn at chelsea which may perhapsbe noticed as the ne plus ultra of ludicrous corruption havingoriginally been a group of bacchanals here risibility could no longer be restrained and a general laughensueda group of bacchanals however continued tom is certainly not anout of the way sign for an inn nor do i conceive its corruption sovery outre when we look at others that have suffered much strangermetamorphoses for who would have thought that time could have performedsuch wonderful changes as to have transformed a view of cologne harbourinto a black bull and a tremendous mouth sufficiently large toswallow its neighbours horns and all or the name la belle sauvage orbeautiful savage into a bell and a gigantic wild man of the woodsthen again said sparkle taking up the subject the pole and basonthough no longer the exhibited emblems of a barber's occupation inlondon are still very often to be met with in its environs and in thecountry where they are ostentatiously protruded from the front ofthe house and denote that one of those facetious and intelligentindividuals who will crop your head or mow your beard dwelleth herelike all other signs that of the barber is of remote antiquity and hasbeen the subject of many learned conjectures some have conceived itto originate from the word poll or head but the true intention ofthe partycoloured staff was to indicate that the master of the shoppractised surgery and could breathe a vein as well as shave a beardsuch a staff being to this day used by practitioners and put into thehand of the patient while undergoing the operation of phlebotomy thewhite band which no doubt you have observed encompassing the staff wasmeant to represent the fillet thus elegantly twined about it and this said sparkle appears to be the most reasonableconjecture of any i ever heard as it is well known the two businesseswere in former times incorporated together and the practiser was termed'a barber surgeon then as to their utility the choice of awitty device or splendid enluminure was formerly thought of greatconsequence to a young beginner in the world and i remember reading ofan innkeeper at cassel who having considerably profited by his numerouscustomers under the sign of the grey ass supposing himself wellestablished in his trade and his house began to be tired of the vulgarsign over his door and availed himself of the arrival of the landgraveof hesse to make as he thought a very advantageous change in anevil hour therefore the grey ass was taken down and thrown asidein order to give place to a well painted and faithful likeness of theprince which was substituted for it as a most loyal signa small and almost unfrequented house in the same town immediatelytook up the discarded sign and speculatively hoisted the grey asswhat was the consequence old codgers married men with scolding vivesat home straggling young fellows and all the fraternity of freetopers resorted to the house filled the taproom crammed theparlour and assailed the bar the grey ass had the run and was allthe vogue whilst the venerable prince of hesse swung mournfullyand deserted at the other place and enticed no visitors foreignor domestic for it should be observed that the grey ass had suchreputation all over germany that every foreign nobleman or gentlemanwho came to cassel was sure to order his coach or chaise to be drivento the inn of that name and this order of course was still continuedfor how was it to be known by travellers coming from vienna hungary orbohemia that a certain innkeeper at cassel had altered his sign to theinn therefore which was denominated the grey ass they still wentwhat could the poor deserted innkeeper do in such a case to deface hestage very indifferent actors in society and large characters in theplaybills as well as loud thunders from the gods may be earned byvery stupid very vulgar and very illbred companions the

of themetropolis that all thoughts of seeking amusement out of doors appearedfor the present relinquished and sparkle to keep the subject aliveresumed as followsin order to give some shade and variety to this sketch of societyin the west we will now if agreeable travel eastward as far as theentrance to the city where i will introduce you in fancy to what mustat least to our friend tallyhoho afford both novelty and surprisesome time ago and before i was quite so well versed in the knowledgeof life in london as at present through the medium of one of the youngmen of genius about town i became a member of a new philosophicalsociety called the socraticss held at a certain house near temple barhaving been plucked by several kind friends till i resembled the manof diogenes i concluded that here at least my pockets might betolerably safe from the diving of a friendly hand philosophers i wastold by my friend the introducer had souls above money their thoughtswere too sublime and contemplative for such worldlyminded concernsi should have a great deal of instruction for little or nothing i hadonly to pay my two guineas per annum and the business was done thegate of science was open and nothing farther was requisite than to pushforward and imitate socrates but how strangely do our anticipationsmislead our sober judgmentsjove breaks the tallest stilts of human trustand levels those who use them with the dustthe proprietor of the institution was rather courtierlike inmaking promises which the managers of course considered as much toocommonplace and mechanical to be kept it professed to exclude politicsand religion from the touch of its scientific paws in other words fromits discussions but alasit kept the word of promise to the earand broke it to the hope the only subjects which it did not exclude were politicsand religion neither could it be said that either of these subjectsreceived more benefit from the way in which they were handled thanawhite dress would from the handling of a chimneysweeper the firstbeing made as black as possible in the form of tompaynim and thelatter served up in the improved shape of harley's or atheism undersuch instruction it was scarcely possible but that i should in processof time become qualified not only for a philosopher but a legislatorof the first water and i had serious thoughts of offering my servicesfor the purpose of drawing up a code of laws to the otaheitans or thekalmuck if i had gone on improving as i did i might perhaps havecarried out to some blackwood settlement or atlantic island as pretty autopian prescription under the designation of a constitution as couldwell be desired in the most philosophical community but one of thosesad trifles which suffocate great ideas and sometimes terminate insuffocating philosophers put a stop to my further enlightenment for thepresent by drying up the treasury of the socraticss the philosopherswere the most civil as well as the most unfortunate people in the worldone or other of them was always in want of money either to perfectsome great scheme or to save him from the unscientific handling of abailiff it was enough to move a milestone to think how the progressof improvement or march of mind as it is called might be delayed bybeing too coldhearted and it did move my purse to such a degree thatat length i had the satisfaction of discerning truth sitting sola atthe bottom of it my pocket consumption however was not instant butprogressive it might be called a slow fever some of the philosophersvisited me for a loan like a monthly epidemic others drained me likea tertian and one or two came upon me like an intermittent agueevery other day among these was mr maxwell the editor as he calledhimself of a magazine this fellow had tried a number of schemes inthe literary line though none had hitherto answered but he had theadvantage and credit of shewing in his own person the high repute inwhich literature is held in london for he could seldom walk the streetswithout having two followers at his heels one of whom frequently tappedhim on the shoulder no doubt to remind him of mortality like theslave in the roman triumphs the favourite thesis of thisgentleman was the march of mind and on this subject he would spouthis half hour in so effectual a manner as to produce two very oppositeeffects viz the closing of the eyes of the elder philosophers andthe opening of mine which latter operation was usually rendered moreeffectual by his concluding inquiry of have you such a thing as a poundnote about youto match this saint there was anotheras busy and perverse a brotherthis was the treasurer of the socraticss thomas carney little esqand a treasure of a treasurer he was this gentleman was a pupil ofaesculapius and united in his own person the various departments ofdentist apothecary and surgeon it is presumed that he found theemployment of drawing the eye teeth of philosophical tyros moreprofitable and bleeding the young socraticss more advantageous thanphysicking his patients in his lectures he advocated the system ofresearch and admired deduction and this i among many others hadreason at last to know it was very odd but so it was that some twoor three hundred per annum subscribed by the members of the societyvanished into the worthy treasurer's pocket as it were a moskoestronand then disappeared for everanother of the socraticss was called epictetus moonshine esquire thisgentleman was a tall spiderlike man with lantern jaws hatchet faceand a mouth the chief characteristic of which was that it made adiagonal line from the bottom of the face to the eyebrow he was agreat speculator and had taken it into his head that beyond theblue mountains in new south wales was the real el dorado but as hepossessed according to the usual phrase more wit than money and noone will discount a check from the aforesaid wit on change the zealof epictetus moonshine some time after the breaking up of the socraticinstitution for benefitting the human race so much got the better ofselflove that he committed several petty larcenies in hopes of beingtransported thither but whether his courage or his luck failed himcertain it is that he never reached the proper degree of criminalityand only succeeded in visiting by turns the various penitentiaries inlondon and its vicinity you mistake greatly sir said he to one of the visitinggovernors of bridewell who condoled with a man of his talents in such aposition if you think a residence in this sequestered haunt a subjectof regret the mind as milton says is its own seat and able of itselfto make'a heaven of hell a hell of heavenand now i am on the subject of stoicism permit me to shew you a picturewhich i have just chalked out wherein i prove that there is no suchthing as pain in the world that all which we now feel is imaginationthat the idea of body is deception i have had it printed written infourteen languages and presented to all the sovereigns of europe witha new code of laws annexed to it i'll bring it in a minute if you'llexcuse me so saying the pupil of zero disappeared wrapping hisblanket round him but other speculations of matters high no doubtattracted him from the remembrance of his promise just as he forgot topay some score pounds he borrowed of me for the visitor saw no more ofhimthe mention of el dorado brings to my recollection another member mrgoosequill who came to town with halfacrown in his pocket and histragedy called the mines of peru by which he of course expected tomake his fortune for five years he danced attendance on the managerin order to hear tidings of its being cast and four more in trying toget it back again during the process he was groaned laughed whistledand nearly kicked out of the secretary's room who swore which he wellmight do considering the exhausted treasury of the concern that heknew nothing about nor ever heard of the mines of peru at last mrgoosequill being shewn into the manager's kitchen to wait till he wasat leisure had the singular pleasure of seeing two acts of the minesof peru daintily fastened round a savory capon on the spit topreserve it from the scorching influence of the firethis was foul treatment i observed as he concluded his tale and iventured to ask how he had subsisted in the meanwhile why said hei first made an agreement with a printer of ballads in seven dialswho finding my inclinations led to poetry expressed his satisfactiontelling me that one of his poets had lost his senses and was confinedin bedlam and another was become dozed with drinking dramsan agreement was made continued he and i think i earned fivepencehalfpenny per week as my share of this speculation with the musesbut as my profits were not always certain i had often the pleasure ofsupping with duke humphrey and for this reason i turned my thoughts toprose and in this walk i was eminently successful for during a week ofgloomy weather i published an apparition on the substance of which isubsisted very comfortably for a month i have often made a good mealupon a monster a rape has frequently afforded me great satisfactionbut a murder welltimed was a neverfailing resourcebut to return to the catastrophe of the socraticss by the time thatthe philosophical experiments in diving without hydraulics had cleanedme entirely out it was suggested that any thing in the shape of a loanwould be desirable they were not nice not they a pair of globes aset of catoptric instruments an electrical apparatus a few antiquebusts or a collection of books for the library any old rum asjacksaid would do and all and every of the beforementioned loanswould be most punctually taken care of and truly enough they were forthe lender was never destined to cast an eye on any portion of the loanagain i was indeed so fortunate as to catch a glimpse of my globesand instruments at a pawnbroker's and the fragments of my library atsundry bookstalls it was now high time to cut the connection for thesocraticss were rapidly withdrawing the association for want of thetrue golden astringent like a dumpling without its suet or a cheapbaker's quartern loaf without its doctor ie alum was falling topieces the worthy treasurer had retired seizing on such articles aswere most within reach and when i called upon him with my resignationi had the pleasure of seeing my own busts handsomely lining the walls ofthe tooth drawer's passage i waited on the socraticss for the bums theyhad been so polite as to borrow one to shew that he had profited bystudying socrates threatened to accuse me and the society of a plot tooverturn the government if a syllable more on so low a subject as moneywas mentioned another told me that he was just going on a visit toabbot's park for three months and should be glad to see me when he cameback a third an unwashed artificer was so kind as to inform me that he had just got whitewashed and he did not care one strawfor my black looks and a fourth an indexmaker when presentedwith his acceptance kindly indicated that he had not the slightestrecollection of the thing and that if i persisted in compellingpayment he would bring a philosophical gentleman from cold bathfields and two honest men from newgate to swear that it was not hishandwritingthe dropcurtain being thus let down on the last act of the farcethere was no alternative between being queerly plundered or instantlylaying a horsewhip over the hungry philosophers to sue them remindedme of the proverb sue a beggar c to crack a masculine joke overtheir sconces would involve an expense which the worthy philosopherswere not worth i had done an imprudent thing in joining the march ofmind and all that i could do was to brush the dust from my coat andthe mud from my shoes he that touches pitch says solomon shallhe not be denied thereby mr treasurer therefore remained inquiet possession of the busts the bookstall displayed the properlyappreciated volumes and the socratic borrowers took all the care in theworld of value receivedthus the day which it was intended to have been spent in amusementsout of doors was passed in animated and amusing conversation over thehospitable and convivial board and a fresh zest was added to wit andhumour by the exhilarating influence of the rosy godchapter xxxiiin london blest

arisen before his usual hour and departed fromhome before the appearance of sparkle and bob to breakfast it was ofcourse supposed that the promised duel would have decided the fate ofone of the antagonists before they should see him againin this conjecture however they were pleasingly disappointed by hisarrival about half past eleven o'clockwell said sparkle it is all over who has fallen which is theman how many shots what distance who was the other second and whereis the wounded heronay said tom you are beforehand with me i have none of theintelligence you require i have been in search of lord blusterwho left town this very morning three hours before my arrival foredinburgh and consequently i suppose either has no intimation oflaconic's intention to seek or if he has is determined to be out ofthe way of receiving a regular challenge so that in all probabilityit will end like many other duels in smoke notwithstanding your friend's letter was so full of fireobserved tallyhohobut perhaps he became more cool over a bottle of claret toe to toe myboy continued sparklethis conversation was interrupted by a letter which being deliveredto tom he read aloud interrupted only by laughter which he could notrestraindear tom don't like fighting in england am off directly forcork tell bluster i'll wait there till he comes but if he valueshis life not to come at allplease do the needful in despatching myservants c within two days for i am in such a passion i can't wait amoment so adieuyours sincerely laconicexcellent upon my word said sparkle here are two men of honourdetermined upon meeting running away from each other even before thepreliminaries are arrangedthere is novelty in it at least said tom though i am by no meansastonished at the end of it for i before observed i do not thinkeither of them over fond of powder laconic pretended that nothing wouldsatisfy him but fighting immediately provided bluster was to be foundany person to whom his character was not known would have expectedsome spilling of blood before this time but it is now plain that thisblustering was the effect of the wine and the man's cooler judgment hasextinguished the flame of his irritabilityi think said tallyhoho it would be well to advise them to meethalfseas over and draw a cork together by way of settling theirdifferencescurse their differences replied dashall i'll have nothing more todo with them upon the whole i am glad now that i could not meet withbluster or i should have looked like a fool between the two and as itis i am not much pleased with the adventure particularly as it mustnecessarily delay me and i hate the idea of travelling alone i shouldvery much have liked to start with you but as laconic has made me fullyacquainted with his affairs in case he should fall in the intendedduel i must even comply with the contents of his note though if hehad not actually departed you may rest assured i would have nothing todo with him or his concerns come come cried sparkle grumbling is of no use now andas the circumstances are not made public the duellists will escapebeing laughed at there is no harm done we must be upon the alert weshortly bid adieu to london and shall not be so well pleased toleave you behind but remember you promise to follow as quickly aspossible now how shall we dispose of the remainder of the timezounds replied tom all my plans are deranged by this foolish affairof laconic's and i can hardly tell which way to move however i shallnot devote myself to his affairs today therefore i am at your serviceand as time is but short with us let us make good use of it thetragedy of the duel having ended most comically i am prepared for anythingfarcical therefore say the word and i am your man for a toddleeast west north or southupon this intimation our friends sallied forth upon a sort of quixoticexcursion in search of adventures for neither could make up his mindas to the precise place of their destination when the first object thatattracted their particular notice was a large printed bill announcingto the public that the sale at fonthill abbey advertised for the thof october would not take place in consequence of the property beingdisposed of by private contractility the following appeared in the daily prints relating tothis valuable propertyfonthill abbey the sale at this splendid mansion is notto take place the estate having been sold by privatecontract the purchaser is said to be mr farquhar a richeast india merchant who is reported to have given lfor the property it is stated that every article in theabbey goes with it with the exception of the family plateand pictures and a very few favourite rarities possessionis to be taken immediately the sale of the whole estate isan event for which the people of the place seem to have beentotally unprepared they were led to believe from thebeginning that nothing was to be sold but the mere luxuriesof the place but as to the abbey they universallyasserted in the strongest manner as if they had goodreason to be convinced of the thing that mr beckfordwould as soon part with his life as with a residence whichhe prized so dearly now however that they have heard fromthe steward that the estate has been sold and that he hasreceived notice to quit his office in a fortnight theybegin to feel that they have lost an excellent landlord mrbeckford has taken a house in town in the new road wherehe means chiefly to reside in future every body is awarethat the chief part of that princely income which enabledhim to raise this expensive edifice from the foundation wasderived from his paternal estates in the west indies suchwas the wealth which those estates at one time producethat it obtained for his grandfather the distinction ofbeing considered the richest subject in europe for the lastten years they have declined very materially and several ofthem have been entirely lost through a defect that has beendiscovered in the title the original purchaser obtainedthese in the way of mortgage and having foreclosed them inan technical manner advantage has been taken of theinformality by the heirs of the mortgagors and mr beckfordhas been dispossessed the defence of his title and theother consequences involved him in losses and vastexpenses besides which the revenue from his unquestionableestates in those islands has declined to less than onetenthof what it formerly was mr farquhar the gentleman who isreported to have purchased fouthill abbey is the principalpartner and proprietor of whitehead's brewhouse and islikewise at the head of the first mercantile house in thecity for the management of all agency concerns connectedwith india thousands of people says dashall who had been flocking tothat neighbourhood intending to obtain a view of the premises will bythis event be disappointed several of my friends have paid a visit toitand describe it as a most princely mansionand pray inquired sparkle what is the cause of its being sold atall it has always been reported that mr beckford was a man of veryextensive propertythat appears to be a little mysterious and report who is always abusy fellow on extraordinary occasions has not been idle by some it isstated that mr beckford suffered great and irreparable losses in hiswest india property and that there are in the abbey at this momentexecutions to the amount of eighty thousand pounds that the view of theeffects has taken place entirely under the control of the sheriffs byothers it is asserted that no such embarrassment exists however bethat as it may the public have been highly gratified for some time pastin being permitted to view the estate and the valuable curiosities itcontains and the produce of the admission tickets which has probablynetted twenty thousand pounds goes to the liquidation of the debts and an excellent plan for raising the wind too said tallyhohothe example i suppose has been taken from wanted housemost likely was the reply but if it is true that the disposal ofthe property is occasioned by the embarrassment of its owner it cannotbut excite painful and melancholy reflections on the tenure by whichmen hold the goods of this life those who were acquainted with mrbeckford's circumstances some years ago thought him so secured in theenjoyment of a princely income that he was absolutely out of the reachof ill fortune being at one time in the actual receipt of one hundredthousand pounds a year it cannot be said of him that he has wasted hisinheritance at the gamingtable the palace which he raised on a barrenmountain the greater part of those vast plantations which surround itthe collection of books and of rare specimens of art and the superbfurniture which gives such peculiar dignity and splendour to theinterior of his residence speak at once the immensity of his means andattest the propriety and gracefulness of their applicationwe ought to have taken a trip there to have seen this earthlyparadise rejoined tallyhoho but now i suppose it is all overcertainly was the reply and it is a circumstance for which thepeople in the neighbourhood appear to have been totally unprepared theywere led to believe from the beginning that the mere luxuries ofthe place were to be sold and the public announcement of this had theeffect of filling the county of wilts with pleasurehunters from allquarters he was fortunate who for some time past could find avacant chair within twenty miles of fonthill the solitude of a privateapartment was a luxury which few could hope for and an old friendof mine informs me in one of his letters that coming from londontravellers first met their troubles about salisbury the languages offrance of holland and of germany the peculiarities in tongue ofscotland and ireland the broad dialect of somersetshire the tinklingaccent of wales and the more polished tones of metropolitan residentswere all at the same moment to be heard clashing and contending therewere bells ringing and chambermaids screaming horses prancing andpostboys swearing wheels clattering and waiters jostling gueststhreatening and hubbub and confusion the orders of the day and allthis to see something which half of them when they got there if theywere so fortunate could not obtain a sight of so that perhaps wehave been quite as well off in remaining at home that was spoken like a philosopher said sparkledryly but pray who is to be the future possessor of this fineestatea mr farquhar who according to the best information i have obtainedis a man of an extraordinary character and has given l for itas it stands with every article in the abbey except the family plateand pictures and a few very favourite rarities some interestingparticulars of the purchaser have recently been made known from whichit appears that he is a native of aberdeen and went out early in lifeto india where he was employed in the medical department chemicalresearch was his favourite pursuit there was some defect in the mannerof manufacturing gunpowder and mr farquhar was selected to give hisassistance by degrees he obtained the management of the concern andfinally he became the sole contractor to the government in this waywealth and distinction rapidly poured in upon him after some years oflabour he returned to england with half a million of money and it issomewhat curious that a man possessed of so much money upon his arrivalat gravesend should merely to save the expense of coachhire walk uptolondon which however it appears he did when his first visitvery naturally was to his banker without waiting for refreshment oralteration of attire full of dust and dirt with clothes not worth aguinea he presented himself at the counter and asked for mr courtsthe clerks not much prepossessed in his favour by his appearancedisregarded his application and he was suffered to remain in thecashoffice under the idea of his being some poor petitioner until mrcourts passing through it recognized his indian customer the man whomhe expected to see with all the pomp of a nabob mr farquhar requestedto have five pounds which having received he took his departure thisanecdote strongly marks the character and habits of the man he soonafterwards settled in upper bakerstreet where his house was to bedistinguished by its dingy appearance uncleaned windows and generalneglect an old woman was his sole attendant and his apartment towhich a brush or broom was never applied was kept sacred from her carehis neighbours were not acquainted with his character and there havebeen instances of some of them offering him money as an object ofcharity an admirable tenant for such a place as fonthill trulyobserved sparkle why what the devil will he do with it now he hasgot itperhaps said dashall i ought to refer you to the man himself foran answer to such a question for i am at a loss to guess he is nowsixtyfive years of age and still in single blessednessa very enviable situation remarked sparkle however continued tomhe has done some good in the world and may live to do more he becamea partner in the great agency house in the city of basset farquharand co besides which he purchased the late mr whitehead's share inthe brewery part of his great wealth was devoted to the purchase ofestates but the great bulk was invested in stock and suffered toincrease on compound interest he is deeply read in ancient and modernliterature and has a mind of extraordinary vigour and originalityhis conversation of a superior order impressive and animated on everysubject his sentiments are liberal and strangely contrasted with hishabits his religious opinions are peculiar and seem to be influencedby an admiration of the purity of the lives and moral principles of thebrahmins it is said that he offered l to found a college inaberdeen with a reservation on points of religion to which howeverthe sanction of the legislature could not be procured and the planwas dropped he has been residing in gloucesterplace where hehas furnished a house in a style of modern elegance and so faras appearances are concerned indulges in several luxuries but hisdomestic habits are still the same and his table seldom labours withthe pressure of heavy dishes he has one nephew to whom he allows ordid allow l per year has but few other claims of family and itis probable that his immense wealth will be bequeathed to charitablepurposes as the great object of his ambition is to leave his name toposterity as the founder of some public institution to that passionmay perhaps be attributed the purchase of fonthill abbey for his ageand infirmities totally unfit him for the enjoyment of such a place he is diminutive in person and by no means prepossessing inappearance his dress has all the qualities of the antique to recommendit and his domestic expenditure until the last year has not exceededl per annum although his possessions money in the funds andcapital in trade are said to amount to a million and a halfwhy he is an oddity indeed exclaimed tallyhoho and i think he oughtto be exhibited as the eighth wonder of the worldcertainly we cannot look upon the like every day there are instancesit is said of his having returned letters merely because the postagewas not paid although he has on more than one or two occasions givenaway at once for praiseworthy purposes ten and twenty thousandpoundsthen rejoined sparkle he is a trump and deserves to berespected but where are we bound tonay replied tom i have no choice upon the subjectnor i neither said gayfield stepping smartly up to him and catchinghim by the hand so come along i'll guide you to good quarters andcomfortable accommodation dine with me and we

culinary artist of established reputation this club was adiversified assemblage consisting of some sprigs of the nobility anda few old standards several members of parliament who became verytroublesome by repeating the speeches that had been uttered in thehouse and were besides always attempting to reform the club but thiswas less offensive to me than others as i make it a rule neverto attend to conversation unless it relates to improvements in cookerythe remainder of our club was composed of a few hungry querulouslawyers two or three doctors who had increased the means of gratifyingtheir appetites by destroying the digestive faculties of their patientsthere is nothing permanent in the world therefore in about two yearsthe club dwindled away a set of rascally economists complained ofexpense the cook a very honest man and skilful professor wasaccused of peculation by the reformers and turned adrift for modestlydemonstrating that he could not make turtle out of tripe nor convertsprats into red mullet several members moved off without payingtheir arrears the managing committee disposed of the premises platefurniture and wines and pocketed the money and thus the club wasdissolvedit was on this occasion that the doctor proposed his celebrated'committee of taste with the proceedings of which i shall perhapshave occasion at some future time to make you acquaintedgayfield's humorous epistle amused the party much and bob feltcomplimented by the attention paid to the finish of his studies ofmetropolitan life and manners the fine appearance of the morningdetermined them on a stroll through the leading thoroughfares as itwould afford tallyhoho the opportunity of completing such purchases aswere necessary prior to his departure for the country in passingcovent garden their attention was attracted by a numerous and grotesqueassemblage in which they soon mixed and were highly diverted by thefollowing whimsical exhibition displaying the astonishing sagacity andfeelings of the monkey species an itinerant showman who for some timepast exhibited two dancing monkeys about the town had pitched his stagein a part of the market when his poles and cords were fixed and themonkeys in their full dress were about to commence the celebratedflying pitman came by with his basket and having furnished himselfwith a bottle of gin he leaped upon the stage and treated the showmanand one of the monkeys with a glass each the other monkey howeverdeclined taking any and was leaping about to avoid it but the pitmanserved out the second glass and the former monkey took his withapparent gladness the pitman again seized the monkey whodeclined it before but he still scorned to take any the bysanderscalled out to the pitman to throw it at him and the pitman flung itin his face instantly the monkey who drank the gin and who was halfdrunk by this time to resent the injury sprang upon the pitman seizedhim by the arm and would have torn that piece of the flesh entirelyout only for its master who with much difficulty made him relinquishhis hold the pitman was dangerously wounded and was carried to adoctor's shop to get his arm dressedpassing on the next object of attention was the police office bowstreet here the party determined to rest for a short time and afterlistening to several uninteresting cases relating to hackney coachfares they were at length rewarded for their lost time and patienceby a case in which the tables were completely turned upon mr jehu andwhich we hope will act as a caution to others of the profession who havea

all the worldby riot and incontinence the worstthe arrival of the day for separation was anticipated and the morningarose upon dashall with a gloomy aspect originating in the temper ofhis mind for he was by no means pleased with the adventure of laconicwhich operated to prevent his departure with his friends sparkle andtallyhoho were however upon the alert and determined on pursuing theiroriginal intentions tom had none of his usual vivacity about himin vain he tried to muster up his spirits his attempts at wit werepointless and did not escape the notice of sparkle who secretly enjoyedhis chagrin feeling assured that as it was created by their departurehe would not delay joining them longer than necessity absolutelyrequired why how now tom said sparkle you are out and seem to bein queer stirrups as if you had an uneasy saddle you seem to partwith your cousin as a young man would with the beloved of his heart iconfess i am disappointed replied tombut since grieving's a follywhy let us be jolly i am determined to spend the last moments with you so startoff the rattle traps the upper toggery's and travelling caps we willtake a last turn together and a parting dinner and glass of wine atthe bull and mouth and i'll warrant you i won't be long behind all iregret is i can't accompany you at present upon this intimation theremainder of their luggage and clothing were despatched by a servantwith an order to provide a good dinner for them at half past fivethings were now all m a fair train and this business being despatchedall was anxiety for the arrival of the moment though with differentsensations sparkle to meet his wife bob to return to his native homeand tom displeased and disappointed in every way although he determinedto be as agreeable as he could under existing circumstances timehowever being heavy on their hands but as bob was anxious to make a fewmore purchases for presents on his return home they started early forthe bull and mouthyou have now said dashall to his cousin had some experience in reallife in london and i have reason to think you will not return to thecountry a worse man than you left it variety is charming and thechange from one to the other will give additional zest and pleasurei have reason replied bob to feel myself under a very particularobligation to you for the excellent care kindness and attention aswell as information i have derived and it cannot easily be obliteratedfrom my recollection but i at the same time must observe that i haveno very great relish for london as a continual residence when youarrive in the country i will try if i cannot be as explanatory andamusing at all events i expect you will give me the triali'll give you a chevy over the hills a pop at the pheasants and apick at them afterwards besides which you know we have some verypretty lasses in our neighbourhood to whom you have already beenintroduced and to whom you shall be better knowni know i know said tom in a hurried manner which stronglyindicated some other motive for regret than that which arose from meredisappointment at not being a partner in their journey and from whichsparkle did not fail to draw an inference that some roguish eyes hadbeen darting their beams into the bosom of his friend i see how it is now cried sparkle tom is not cut butcaught and i'll sport a fifty that the evergreen tom dashall oflondon will be transplanted to entwine with some virgin blossom of thecountry before another twelve monthstom was silenttallyhoho smiled in accordance with the sentiment of sparkle and declaredhe would not take the betit's of very little use cried dashall recovering himself after ashort pause i may as well make a merit of necessity i confess ihave a sort of a liking for the gay and sprightly lydia forcetext theparson's daughter and if but curse if's i hate if i wish there wasno such word in the english languageha ha ha exclaimed sparkle i thought we should find you out butcome i think i may say there is not much for you to fear if you arebut seriousit is a serious subject and if we continue this conversation i shallgrow downright sentimental so no more at present we have not much timeto spare and as i mean to make use of every minute let us look aroundfor any novelty that may occur before your departurewell said sparkle i must say i do not know of any thing so new tomeas the very subject we were upon but as you wish it dropped whye'en let it be so i have no desire to be either particular orpersonaland as london's the object we've long had in viewas long as we can we'll that object pursueand as visions we know have been for an old grudge meantwe'll make ours a view not a vision of judgmentgood said tom and as the lines are extemporaneous we will not beovernice in the criticismat least continued sparkle you will admit it is better to be a badpoet than a bad managreed agreed replied tom but who in the name of wonder havewe here the emperor of hairdressers and headcutters turnedprintseller why this was money's where i have before now had aclip nay nay said sparkle don't be in a hurry to form yourjudgment his ingenuity is at work and really it will be worth whileto have a cut all round for i find he gives a portrait displayingthe most fashionable parisian dresses to every customer some youknow present bank or more properly speaking flush notes upon theseoccasions but certainly this is a less exceptionable plan what sayyouwith all my heart and into the magazine de mode they marched towhich they were welcomed by the artist himself ushered up stairswith all due politeness and in two minutes sparkle was under hisincomparable hands while tom and bob amused themselves with a peep atthe newspapers and the gazette of fashionfine morning gentlemen said the friseuris there any news asked sparklewe have the paris papers sir regularly and a constant supply ofdrawings of the newest fashioni am more for domestic or home news continued sparklenot aware sir of any thing particular oh yes i recollect i wastold last night over at the haunch that the mermaid is discoveredwhat said tom discover a mermaid over a haunch laying down thepaperbeg pardon sir beg pardon a trifling mistake sir nothing more iusually pass a recreative hour after my daily studies at the haunchof venison over the way the landlord is an intelligent accommodatingand agreeable sort of man and we have many gentlemen of considerableconsequence both literary and scientific who meet there of an eveningto pass a convivial hour to hear and impart the news and sir as iwas saying the mermaid is stated to be a fine hoax upon the credulityof john bull being nothing more than the body or skin of a smokedriedold woman ingeniously connected with the tail of a fish i don't vouchfor the truth of the report i only state what i hear and can onlyassert with confidence what i am acquainted with in my own businessi suspected the mermaid from the first answered tom i thought therewas some deceit in itthere is a great deal of deceit in the world sir replied the activeclipper a little circassian cream sir acknowledged to be the bestarticle ever produced for the preservation and restoration of haircertainly said sparkle in this way our friends obtained a portion of amusement anda corinthian clip from the intelligent and communicative mr money offleet street notoriety in return for which he touched their coinnow said dashall we will make the best of our way and just callby way of taking a lunch among the lads of newgate market there isa house where i have been before in which we can have some veryfine homebrewed ale c and besides according to the landlord'sadvertisements he has opened an academy and gives instruction inthe art of brewing the college of physicians is just opposite and isuppose this wag of a landlord has taken the hint and opposed his beerto their physic perhaps you may wish to carry his valuable receipt intothe country with youi have no inclination to turn brewer replied sparkle but imust confess i like the idea of a little genuine beer free from thepoisonous ingredients of the public brewerand so do i continued tallyhoho come along then said tom thebell in warwick lane is the shop where you may be served to a shavingin passing along warwick lane bob observed he thought his friend wasleading him through a not very agreeable neighbourhoodthis place is filled with slaughterhouses and is to be sure a greatnuisance to the city yet such places are necessary therefore bear upa few minutes and you will have comfortable houseroom and agreeablerefreshment entering the bell they were met by the landlord of thehouse a roundfaced goodnatured real johnbulllooking manwho knowing his customer dashall immediately ushered them into thecoffeeroom where being supplied with stout and muttonchops in highperfection they enjoyed themselves with their regale this done theyhad an opportunity of looking about themin one corner

author bargaining with a bookseller of paternoster rowfor the sale of a manuscript by which he expected to realise a dinnerwhile near them was an undertaker and a masterbuilder vociferating ateach other for interference with their respective trades andso far attracting the attention of the bookseller from the work of theauthor that he wished from the bottom of his heart that one wouldbuild a coffin to bury the other while the salesmen laughed so loud atthe observations of the controversialists as almost to make them wishthe subject dead without the hope of resurrectionbob liked the stout

treatment comfortable beds happy to see youat all times at the bell breweryhaving proceeded on their journey they shortly found themselves nearbull and mouth streeton their way to the bull and mouth sparkle made a proposal which wascordially acquiesced in by dashall and his cousin and a mutual pledgewas given to carry it into effect this was no other than an agreementto take a trip over to dublin in the course of the ensuing winter inorder to acquire some knowledge of life in irelandi have lately said sparkle been almost convulsed with laughtereven to the danger of a lockedjaw by the perusal of a work underthis title the author nephew to a late irish chancellor is an oldacquaintance added to which and the genuine irresistible humour thatruns throughout the work i feel determined to visit and have oculardemonstration of some of the places where these scenes of humour are soadmirably describedon entering bull and mouth street bless me cried bob this is avery confined street for such an innhoy cried a coachman rattling along the street in double quick timeby your leave bawled a porter with a heavy chest on his backwe shall certainly either be knocked down or run over

about us on the rightafter passing the gate is the coachoffices for receiving booking and delivering parcels and taking places for passengers by thevarious vehicles which start from this place on the left is the hoteland coffeehouse where every refreshment and accommodation may beobtained the remaining part of the building together with severalothers adjoining which almost occupy the whole of this side ofthe street are devoted to stables waggon and coachhouses andoutofficesillustration pagejpg bull and mouth innit is an extensive concern then said tallyhoho though it stands insuch an out of the way obscure situationwhy you are already aware that situation is not absolutely necessaryto success in all cases in london was the reply the extensivecirculation of a name or a sign are sometimes sufficient to obtainbusiness and who has not heard of the bull and mouth or the name ofwillan from the former runs a considerable number of long stages andmail coaches daily and nightly the proprietor being a contractor withgovernment and upon one occasion it is said he was in treaty to supplyan immense quantity of horses to convey troops to the coast on thethreatened invasion by buonaparte so that the epithet patriotic mightproperly be applied to him he however is lately deceased and supposedto have left a considerable fortune but come dinner is ready now forthe parting meal and then heaven speed ye to your destined homesafter partaking of a hearty dinner and a bottle or two of generouswine come said dashall it is time we are alive and look out forthe yard is all in a bustle here are lots of coaches preparing for astart so let us get out look around and see what is going forwardupon this intimation they sallied forth to the yard where theconfusion created by the arrival of one coach heavily laden andthe preparation of two for departure afforded a scene for a quietcontemplation which however it is not easy to describecoachman said an antiquated lady just alighting i paid my fareyes ma'am that's all fair said coachmind how you hand my dear little boy out of the coach poor littlefellow he is quite dizzy with riding i thinks as how you had better have brought a man with

you can afford an inside birthpart of the journeyi'll see what i can do but can't promise now gentlemenhere coachman said the person desirous of obtaining a passagetipping coach some moneyaye aye that's the way to look at the matterby this time tom discovered it was no other than van butchell whomhe observed to bob there was little doubt had been summoned on somedesperate case and must go at all events it is fortunate for the rising generation that the latemartin van butcher not more celebrated for hiseccentricities than his utility has not departed from theworld without leaving an able successor to his practiceedwin martin van butcher is now almost as well known as hislate father such indeed is the estimation of his abilitiesthat a large society of journeymen tailors have entered intoa weekly subscription among themselves in order that theirafflicted brethren may have the benefit of his practicalknowledge and abilitiesnow gentlemen you brush in and i will brush on shut the door dickall right ya hipadieu dear tom exclaimed bob zounds exclaimed tom the coachman will hardly allow him tosay good bye well the dearest friends must part so good bye heavenprotect you bothby
