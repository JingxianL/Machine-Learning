on visiting those disinterred remains of an ancientcity which more perhaps than either the deliciousbreeze or the cloudless sun the violet valleys andorange groves of the south attract the travellerto the neighbourhood of naples on leaving stillfresh and vivid the houses the streets the templesthe theatres of a place existing in the haughtiestage of the roman empire â it was not unnaturalperhaps that a writer who had before laboured iioaaever unworthily in the art to revive and to createshould feel a keen desire to people once more thosedeserted streets to repair those graceful ruins toreanimate the bones which were yet spared tohis survey to traverse the gaulish of eighteencenturies and to wake to a second existence âthe city of the dead and the reader will easily imagine how sensiblythis desire grew upon one who felt he could perform his undertaking with pompeii itself at thedistance of a few miles â the sea that once bore hercommerce and received her fugitives at his feet âand the fatal mountain of vesuvius still breathingforth smoke and fire constantly before his eyes i was aware however from the first of thegreat difficulties with which i had to contendto paint the manners and exhibit the life of themiddle ages required the hand of a master genius yet perhaps the task is slight and easy in comparisonwith that which aspires to portray a farearlier and more unfamiliar period with the menand customs of the feudal time we have a naturalsympathy and bond of alliance those men wereour own ancestors â from those customs we receivedour own â the creed of our chivalric fathersis still ours â their tombs yet consecrate our churchesthe ruins of their castles yet frown over our valnearlythe whole of this work was written at naples lastwinter on ray return to england i was indeed too muchoccupied with political matters to have a great deal ofsuperfluous leisure for works purely literary except iu thosenot unwelcome intervals when the parliament going to sleepallows the other objects of life to awake â dismissing its weariedlegislators some to hunt some to shoot some to fatten oxenand others â to cultivate literature less we trace in their struggles for liberty andfor justice our present institutions and in theelements of their social state we behold the originof our ownbut with the classical age we have no householdand familiar associations the creed of that departedreligion the customs of that past civilization presentlittle that is sacred or attractive to our northernimagination they are rendered yet more triteto us by the scholastic pedantries which first acquaintedus with their nature and are linked withthe recollection of studies which were imposed asalabour and not cultivated as a delightyet the task though arduous seemed to meworth attempting and in the time and the scenei have chosen much may be found to arouse thecuriosity of the reader and enlist his interest inthe descriptions of the author it was the firstcentmy of our religion â it was the most civilizedperiod of rome â the conduct of the story liesamidst places whose relics we yet trace â thecatastrophe is among the most awful which thetragedies of ancient history present to our surveyfrom the ample materials before me my endeavourhas been to select those which would be mostattractive to a modern reader â the customs andsuperstitions least unfamiliar to him â the shadowsthat when reanimated would present to himsuch images as while they represented the pastmight be least uninteresting to the speculations ofthe present it did indeed require a greater selfcontrolthan the reader may at first imagine toreject much that was most inviting in itself butwhich it might have added attraction toparts of the work avould have been injurious tothe symmetry of the whole thus for instancethe date of my story is that of the short reignof titus when rome was at its proudest andmost gigantic eminence of unbridled luxury andunrivalled power it was therefore a most invitingtemptation to the author to conduct thecharacters of his tale during the progress of itsincidents from pompeii to rome what couldaflbrd such materials for description or such fieldfor the vanity of display as that gorgeous cityof the world whose grandeur could lord so brightan inspiration to fancy â so favourable and sosolemn a dignity to research but in choosing formy subject â my catastrophe the destruction ofpompeii it repaired but little uniiht into thehigher principles of art to perceive that to pompeiithe story should be rigidly confinedplaced in contrast with the mighty pomp ofrome the luxuries and gaud of the vivid campanianncity would have sunk into insignificanceher awful fate would have seemed but a pettyand isolated wreck in the vast seas of the imperialsway and the auxiliary i should have summonedto the interest of my story would only have destroyedand overpowered the cause it was invokedto support i was therefore compelled to relinquishan episodical excursion so alluring in itselfand confining my story strictly to pompeii toleave to others the honour of delineations hollowbut majestic civilization of romethe city whose fate supplied me with so superband awful a catastrophe supplied easily from thefirst survey of its remains the characters mostsuited to the subject and the scene the

of vesuvius for the existence of the blindgirl i am indebted to a casual conversation with agentleman well known amongst the english atnaples for his general knowledge of the manypaths of life speaking of the utter davloiessavhicli accompanied the first recorded eruption ofvesuvius and the additional obstacle it presentedto the escape of the inhabitants he observed thatthe blind would be the most favoured in such amoment and find the easiest deliverance thisremark originated the creation of lydiathe characters therefore are the natural offspringof the scene and time â the incidentsof the tale are equally consonant perhaps to thethen existent society for it is not only the ordinaryhabits of life the feasts and the forumthe baths and the amphitheatre the commonplaceroutine of the classic luxury which wepreface xirecall the past to behold equally important andmore deeply interesting are the passions thecrimes the misfortunes and reverses that mighthave chanced to the shades we thus summon tolife we understand any epoch of the world butill if we do not examine its romance â there is asmuch truth in the poetry of life as in its proseas the greatest difficulty in treating of an unfamiliarand distant period is to make the charactersintroduced live and move before the eyeof the reader so such should doubtless be the firstobject of a work of the present description â andall attempts at the display of learning should beconsidered but as means subservient to this themain requisite of fiction the first art of thepoet the creator is to breathe the breath of lifeinto his creatures â the next is to make theirwords and actions appropriate to the era in whichthey are to speak and act this last art is perhapsthe better effected by not bringing the artitself constantly before the reader â by not crowdingthe page with quotations and the margin withnotes perpetual references to learned authoritieshave in fiction something at once wearisome andarrogant they appear like the author's eulogiesxu prefaceon his own accuracy and his own learning â theydo not serve to elucidate his meaning hut toparade his erudition the intuitive spirit whichinfuses antiquity into ancient images is perhapsthe true learning which a work of this naturerequires â without it pedantry is offensive withit useless no man who is thoroughly aware ofwhat prose fiction has now become of its dignityof its influence â of the manner in which it hasgradually absorbed all similar departments of literatureâ of its power in teaching as well as amusingcan so far forget its connection with history âwith philosophy â with politics â its utter harmonywith poetry and obedience to truth as to debaseits nature to the level of scholastic frivolities he raises scholarship to the creative and does notbow the creative to the scholasticwith respect to the language used by thecharacters introduced i have studied carefullyto avoid what has always seemed to me a fatalerror in those who have attempted in moderntimes to introduce the beings of a classical ageâ what the strong common sense of sir walter scott hasexpressed so well in his to ivanhoe st

stiltedsentences â the cold and didactic solemnities ofme avail myself of the words i refer to and humbly and reverentlyappropriate them for the moment it is true that ineither can nor do pretend to the observation observance ofcomplete accuracy even in matters of outward costume much lessin the more important points of language and manners but thesame motive which prevents my writing the dialogue of thepiece in anglosaxon or in normanfrench in latin or ingreek and which prohibits my sending forth this essay printedwith the types of caxton or wynken de worde writleii with areed upon jive rolls of parchmentastened to a cylinder andadorned with a boss prevents my attempting to confine myselfwithin the limits of the period in which my story is laid it isnecessary for exciting

itrust devour this book with avidity liem i have so far explainedancient manners in modern language and so far detailedthe characters and sentiments of my persons that the modernreader will not find himself i should hope much trammelled bythe repulsive dryness of mere antiquity in this i respectfullycontend i have in no respect exceeded the fair licence due to theauthor of a fictitious compositionit is true proceeds my authority that this licence is confinedwithin legitimate bounds the author must introducenothing inconsistent with the manners of the zgsâ prefaceto ivanhoei can add nothing to these judicious and discriminating remarksâthey form the true canons of criticism by which allfiction that portrays the past should be judgedxiv prefacelanguage which they find in the more admired ofthe classical writers it is an error as absurd tomake romans in common life talk in the periodsof cicero as it would be in a novelist to endoavhis english personages with the longdrawn sentencesof johnson or burke the fault is thegreater because while it pretends to learning itbetrays in reality the ignorance of just criticismit fatigues â it wearies â it revolts â and wehave not the satisfaction in yawning to thinkthat we yawn eruditely to impart anything likefidelity to the dialogues of classic actors we mustbeware to use a university phrase how wecram for the occasion â nothing can give to awriter a more stiff and uneasy gait than the suddenand hasty adoption of the toga ave mustbring to our task the familiarized knowledge ofmany years â the allusions the phraseology âthe language generally â must flow from a streamthat has long been full the flowers must be transplantedfrom a living soil and not bought secondhandat the nearest marketplace this advantagewhich is in fact only that of familiarity aithour subject is one derived rather from accidentthan merit and depends upon the degree in whichpreface xvthe classics have entered into the education of ouryouth and the studies of our maturity yet evendid a writer possess the utmost advantage of thisnature which education and study can bestow itmight be scarcely possible so entirely to transporthimself to an age so different from his own butthat he would incur some inaccuracies some errorsof inadvertence or forgetfulness and when inworks upon the manners of the ancients workseven of the gravest character composed by the profoundestscholars some such imperfections willoften be discovered even by a critic in comparisonbut superficially informed it would be far too presumptuousin me to hope that i have been morefortunate than men infinitely more learned in awork in which learning is infinitely less requiredit is for this reason that i venture to believe thatscholars themselves will be the most lenient of myjudges enough if this book whatever its imperfectionsshould be found a portrait â unskilfulperhaps in colouring â faulty in drawing âbut not altogether an unfaithful likeness of thefeatures and the costume of the aofe which ihave attempted to paint â may it be what isfar more important a just representation of thexvi prefacehuman passions and the human heart whoseelements in all ages are the same oneword more â let me be permitted to remind thereader that if i have succeeded in giving some interestand vitality to a description of classic mannersand to a tale of a classic age i have succeededwhere all hitherto have failed a necessary corollaryfrom this proposition is one equally consolatorythough less triumphant viz if i have failedin the attempt i fail where no one has succeededafter this sentence i can hut conclude at once âcan i say anything more effectually to provethat an author never shows half so much ingenuityas in making

mydevotion my prayer gushed from my heart to mylips and i wept as i prayed i was startled inthe midst of my devotions however by a deepsigh i turned suddenly round and just behind mealas a female she had raised her veil also inprayer and when our eyes met methought acelestial ray shot from those dark and shining orbsat once into my soul never my clodius havei seen mortal face more exquisitely

we followed the priestin his ceremonial prayer together we touchedthe knees of the goddess â together we laid ourolive garlands on the altar i felt a strangeemotion of almost sacred tenderness at

houses of pompeii which he mill find to resemblestrongly the plans of vitruvius but withallthose differences in detail of caprice and tastepompeii which being natural to mankind have alwayspuzzled antiquaries we shall endeavour to makethis description as clear and pedantic as possibleyou enter then usually by a small entrancepassage called vestibule into a hall sometimeswith but more frequently without the ornamentof columns around three sides of this hall aredoors communicating with several bedchambersamong which is the porter's the best of thesebeing usually appropriated to country visitors atthe extremity of the hall on either side to theright and left if the house is large there are twosmall recesses rather than chambers generally devotedto the ladies of the mansion and in thecentre of the tesselated pavement of the hall is invariablya square shallow reservoir for rainwaterclassically termed impluvium which was admittedby a hole in the roof above the saidaperture being

robber todetach it from its position this chest was supposedto be the moneybox or coffer of the masterof the house though as no money has been foundin any of the chests discovered at pompeii it isprobable that it was sometimes rather designed forornament than usein this hall or atrium to speak classically theclients and visitors of inferior rank were usuallyreceived in the houses of the more respectablean atriensis or slave peculiarly devoted to theservice of the hall was invariably retained and hisrank among his fellowslaves was high and importantthe reservoir in the centre must havebeen rather a dangerous ornament but the centreof the hall was like the grassplat of a college andinterdicted to the passers to and fio who foundample space in the margin right opposite thepompeii entrance

term a cabinet ofgems containing whatever curiosities were deemedmost rare and costly and invariably a small passagefor the slaves to cross to the farther parts ofthe house without passing the apartments thusmentioned these rooms all opened on a squareor oblong colonnade technically termed peristyleif the house was small its boundary ceased withthis colonnade and in that case its centre howeverdiminutive was ordinarily appropriated to thepurpose of a garden and adorned with vases offlowers placed upon pedestals while under thecolonnade to the right and left were doors admittingto

the house was large it did notend with the peristyle and the centre thereofwas not in that case a garden but might be perhapsadorned with a fountain or basin for fishand at its cud exactly opposite to

peristyle communicatingwith each other in all you find the wallsrichly painted and in all the evidence of a peoplefond of the refining elegances of life the purity ofthe taste of the pompeians in decoration is howeverquestionable they were fond of the gaudiest coloursof fantastic designs they often painted the lowerhalf of their columns a bright red leaving the restuncoloured and where the garden was small itswall was frequently tinted to deceive the eye asto its extent imitating trees birds temples cin perspective â a meretricious delusion which thepompeii graceful pedantry of pliny

â a look of resigned sorrow of tranquil endurancehad banished the smile but not the sweetnessfrom her lips something timid and cautiousin her step â something wandering in her eyesled you to

veil seemed lifted from his eyes he saw thatimmeasurable distance between himself and hisassociates which the deceiving mists of pleasurehad hitherto concealed he was refined by asense of his courage in aspiring to lone he feltthat henceforth it was his destiny to look upwardand to soar he could no longer breathe thatname which sounded to the sense of his ardentfancy as something sacred and divine

richly endowed âjulia the daughter of the wealthy diomed whosegold the gamester imagined he could readily divertinto his own coffers their conversation didnot flow with its usual ease and no sooner

from this trite and commonplace earth youwere in a land in which your eyes saw everythingthrough an enchanted medium in her presenceyou felt as if listening to exquisite music youwere steeped in that

was peculiarly formed then to commandand fascinate the less ordinary and the bolder naturesof men to love her was to unite two passionsvol i l the last days ofthat of love and of ambition â you

alike enthralled himsot apart himself from the common world heloved that daringness of character which also madeitself among common things aloof and alone hedid not or he would not see that that very isolationput her yet more from him than from thetilgar far as the poles â far as the night fromday his solitude was divided from hers he wassolitary from his dark and solemn vices â she fromher beautiful fancies and her purity of virtueif it was not strange that lone thus enthralledthe egyptian far less strange was it that shehad captured as suddenly as irrevocably the brightand sunny heart of the athenian the gladnessof a temperament which seemed woven from thebeams of light had led glaucus into pleasure heobeyed no more vicious dictates when he wanderedinto the dissipations of his time than the exhilaratingvoices of youth and health he threwpompeii the brightness of his native over every abyss andcavern through which he strayed his imaginationdazzled him but his heart never was

sympathy that united him to them he feltit is true the impulse of nobler thoughts andhigher aims than in pleasure could be indulged but the world was one vast prison to which thesovereign of rome was the imperial gaoler â andthe very virtues which in the free days of athenswould have made him ambitious in the slavery ofearth made him inactive and supine for in thatunnatural and bloated

independent in her choice oflife so was her modest pride proportionably vigilantand easily alarmed the falsehood of theegyptian was invented by a deep knowledge ofher nature the story of coarseness â of indelicacyin glaucus stung her to the quick she felt it areproach upon her character and her career a punishmentabove all to her love she felt for thepompeii first time how suddenly she had yielded to thatlove she blushed with shame at a weakness theextent of which she was startled to perceive sheimagined it was that weakness which had incurredthe contempt of glaucus she endured the bitterestcurse of noble natures â humiliation â yet herlove perhaps was no less alarmed than her prideif one moment she murmured reproaches uponglaucus â if one moment she renounced she almosthated him â at the next she burst into passionatetears her heart yielded to its softness and she saidin the bitterness of anguish he despises me â hedoes not love me from the hour the egyptian had left her shehad retired to her most secluded chamber â shehad shut out her handmaids â she had deniedherself to the crowds that besieged her doorglaucus was excluded with the rest he wonderedbut he guessed not why he never attributedto his lone â his queen â his goddess â thatwomanlike caprice of which the lovepoets of italyso unceasingly complain he imagined her in themajesty of her candour above all the arts thattorture he was troubled but his hopes avere not the last days ofdimmed for he knew already that he loved andwas beloved vhat more could he desire as anamulet against fear at deepest night then when the streets werehushed and the high moon only beheld his devotionshe stole to that temple of his heart â her home andwooed her after the beautiful fashion of his countryhe covered her threshold with the richestgarlands in which every flower was a ofsweet passion and he charmed the long summernight with the sound of the lycian lute andverses which the inspiration of the moment sufficedto weavebut the window above opened not no smilemade yet more holy the shining air of night allwas still and dark he knew not if his verse waswelcome and

in that delicate flattery ancav affronti said she was denied to all but there was oneexception â there was one person who would notbe denied assuming over her actions and her housesomething like the authority of a parent arbacesfor himself claimed an exemption from all theceremonies observed by others he entered thethreshold with the licence of one who feels that heis privileged and at home he made his way toher solitude and with that sort of quiet andapologetic air which seemed to consider theright as a thing of course with all the independenceof lone's character his art had enabled himto obtain a secret and powerful control over hermind she could not shake it off sometimes liedesired to do so but she never actively struggledagainst it she was fascinated by his serpent eyehe arrested he commanded her by the magic ofa mind long accustomed to awe and to subdueutterly unaware of his real character or his hiddenlove she felt for him the reverence whichgenius feels for wisdom and virtue for sanctityl the last days ofshe regarded him as one of those mighty sages ofoil who attained to the mysteries of knowledgeby an exemption from the passions of their kindshe scarcely considered him as a being like herselfof the earth but as an oracle at once dark andsacred she did not love him but she fearedhis presence alas unwelcome to her it dimmedher spirit even in its brightest mood he seemedwith his chilling and lofty aspect like some eminencewhich casts a shadow over the sun but shenever thought of forbidding his visits she waspassive under the influence which created in herbreast not the repugnance but something of thestillness of terrorarbaces himself now resolved to exert allhis arts to possess himself of that treasure heso burning coveted he was cheered andelated by his conquest over her brother fromthe hour in which aacides fell beneath thevoluptuous sorcery of that fete which wehave described he felt his empire over theyoung priest triumphant and ensured heknew that there is no victim so thoroughlysubdued ass a young and fervent man for thepompeii âłfirst time delivered to the thraldom of thesenseswhen apaecides recovered with the morninglightfrom the profound sleep which succeeded tothe delirium of wonder and of please he was it istrue ashamed â terrified â appalled his vows ofausterity and celibacy echoed in his ear his thirstafter holiness â had it been quenched at so unhalloweda stream but arbaces knew well the meansby which to confirm his conquest from the artsof pleasure he led the young priest at once tothose of his mysterious wisdom he bared to hisamazed eyes the initiatory secrets of the sombrephilosophy of the nile â those secrets plucked fromthe stars and the wild chemistry which in thosedays when reason herself was but the creature ofimagination might well pass for the lore of adiviner magic he seemed to the young eyes ofthe priest as a being above mortality and endowedwith supernatural gifts that yearningand intense desire for the knowledge which isnot of earth â which had burnt from his boyhoodin the heart of the priest â was dazzleduntil it confused and mastered his clearer the last days ofsense he gave himself to the art which thusaddressed at once the two strongest of humanpassions that of pleasure and that of knowledgehe was loth to believe that one so wisecould err â that one so lofty could stoop todeceive entangled in the dark web of metaphysicalmoralities he caught at the excuse by whichthe egyptian converted vice into a virtue hispride was insensibly flattered that arbaces haddeigned to rank him with himself â to set himapart from the laws which bound the vulgar â tomake him an august participator both in themystic studies and the magic fascinations of hissolitude the pure and stern lessons of that creedto which olinthus had sought to make him convertwere swept away from his memory by thedeluge of new passions and the egyptian whowas versed in the articles of that true faith andwho soon learned from his pupil the effect whichhad been produced upon him by its believerssought not unskilfully to undo that effect by atone of reasoning half sarcastic and half earnestthis faith said he is but a borrowed plagiarismfrom one of the many allegories invented bypompeii our priests of old observe he added pointing toa hieroglyphical scroll â observe in these antientfigures the origin of the christian's trinity hereare also three gods â the deity â the spirit â andthe son observe that the epithet of the son is'saviour â observe that the sign by which hishuman qualities are denoted is the cross notehere too the mystic history of osiris how he puton death â how he lay in the grave and how thusfulfilling a solemn atonement he rose again fromthe dead in these stories we but design topaint an allegory from the operations of natureand the evolutions of the eternal heavens butthe allegory unknown the types themselves havefurnished to credulous nations the materials ofmany creeds they have travelled to the vastplains of india they have mixed themselves upin the visionary speculations of the greek becomingmore and more gross and embodied as theyemerge farther from the shadows of their antiqueorigin they have assumed â human and palpableform in this novel faith and the believers ofthe believer will draw from this vague coincidence a verydifferent corollary than that of the egyptian the last days ofgalilee are but the unconscious repeaters of one ofthe superstitions of the nile this was the last argument which completelysubdued the priest it was necessary to him as tofull â to believe in something â and undividedand at last reluctant he surrendered himselfto that belief which arbaces inculcated and whichall that was human in passion â all that was flatteringin vanity â all that was alluring in pleasure âserved to invite to and contributed to confirmthis conquest thus easily made the egyptiancould now give himself wholly up to the pursuit ofa far dearer and mightier object and he hailedin his success with the brother an omen of histriumph over the sisterhe had seen lone on the day following the revelwe have witnessed and which was also the dayafter he had poisoned her mind against his rivalthe next day and the next he saw her also andeach time he laid himself out with consummateart partly to confirm her impression against glaucusand principally to prepare her for the impressionshe desired her to receive the proud lone tookcare to conceal the anguish she endured and thepompeii pride of woman has an hypocrisy which can deceivethe most penetrating and shame the mostastute but arbaces was no less cautious not torecur to a subject which he felt it was most politicto treat as of the lightest importance he knewthat by dwelling much upon the fault of a rivalyou only give him dignity in the eyes of your mistress the wisest plan is neither loudly to hatenor bitterly to contemn the wisest plan is tolower him by an indifference of tone as if youcould not dream that he could be loved yoursafety is in concealing the wound to your ownpride and imperceptibly alarming that of the umpireavhose voice is fate such in all times willbe the policy of one who knows the science of thesex â it was now the egyptian'she recurred no more then to the presumptionof glaucus he mentioned his name butnot more often than that of clodius or of lepidushe affected to class them together as things ofa low and ephemeral species as things wantingnothing of the butterfly save its innocence and itsgrace sometimes he slightly alluded to someinvented debauch in which he declared them com the last days ofpassions sometimes he reverted to them as theantipodes of those lofty and spiritual natures towhose order that of lone belonged blinded alikeby the pride of lone and perhaps by his own hedreamed not that she already loved but he dreadedlest she might have formed for glaucus the firstfluttering prepossessions that lead to love andsecretly he ground his teeth in rage and jealousywhen he reflected on the youth the fascinationsand the brilliancy of that formidable rival he pretendedto undervalueit was on the fourth day from the date of theclose of the previous book that arbaccs and lonesate togetheryou wear your veil at home said the egyptian that is not fair to those whom you honourwith your friendshipsbut to arbaces answered lone who indeedhad cast the veil over her features to conceal eyesred with weeping â to arbaces who looks onlyto the mindwhat matters it that the face is concealedi do look only to the mind replied the egypttian show me then your face â for there i shallsee it you grow gallant in the air of pompeii saidlone with a forced tone of gaietydo you think fair lone that it is only atpompeii that i have learned to value you theegyptian's voice trembled â he paused for a momentand then resumedthere is a love beautiful greek which isnot the love only of the thoughtless and the young âthere is a love which sees not with the eyes whichhears not with the ears but in which soul isenamoured of soul the comitesman of thy ancestorsthe cavenursed plato dreamed of sucha love â his followers have sought to imitate it but it is a love that is not for the herd to echo â itis a love that only high and noble natures can conceiveâ it hath nothing in common with the sympathiesand ties of coarse affection â wrinkles donot revolt it â the homeliness of feature does notdeter â it asks youth it is true â but it asks it onlyin the freshness of the emotions â it asks beauty itis true â but it is the beauty of the thought and of the lear days ofthe spirit such is the love o lone which is aworthy offering to thee from the cold and theaustere austere and cold thou deepest me âsuch is the love that i venture to lay upon thyshrine â thou canst receive it without a blushand its name is friendship v replied lone her answer was innocent â yet it sounded like thereproof of one conscious of the design of the speakerfriendship said arbaces vehemently nothat is a word too often profaned to apply to asentiment so sacred friendship it is a tie thatbinds fools and profligates friendship it is thebond that unites the frivolous hearts of a glaucusand a clodius friendship i no that is an affectionof earth of vulgar habits and sordid sympathies the feeling of which i speak is borrowedfrom the stars â it partakes of that mystic and ineffableyearning which we feel when we gaze onthem â it burns â yet it purifies â it is the lamp ofnaphtha in the alabaster vase â glowing with fragrantodours but shining only through the purestvessels no it is not love and it is not friendshipthat arbaces feels for lone give it noplatopompeii soname â earth has no name for it â it is not ofearth â why debase it with earthly epithets andearthly associationsnever before had arbaces ventured so far yethe felt his ground step by step he knew that heuttered a language which if at this day of affectedplatonism would speak unequivocally to the earsof beauty was at that time strange and unfamiliarto which no precise idea could be attached fromwhich he could imperceptibly advance or recedeas occasion suited as hope encouraged or feardeterred lone trembled though she knew notwhy her veil hid her features and masked anexpression which if seen by the egyptian wouldhave at once damped and enraged him in fact henever meas more displeasing to her â the harmoniousmodulation of the most suasive voice that ever disguisedunhallowed thought fell discordantly onher ear her whole soul was still filled with theimage of glaucus and the accent of tendernessfrom another only revolted and dismayed yetshe did not conceive that any passion more ardentthan that platonism which arbaces expressedkicked beneath his words she thought that he the last days ofin truth spoke only of the affection and sympathyof the soul but was it not precisely that affectionand that sympathy which had made a part of thoseemotions she felt for glaucus and could any otherfootstep than his approach the haunted actus ofher heartanxious at once to change the conversation shereplied therefore with a cold and indifferentvoice whomsoever arbaces honours with thesentiments of esteem it is natural that his elevatedwisdom should colour that sentiment with its ownhues it is natural that his friendship should bepurer than that of others whose pursuits and errorshe does not deign to share but tell me arbaceshast thou seen my brother of late he has notvisited me for several days and when i last sawhim his manner disturbed and alarmed me much i fear lest he was too precipitate in the severechoice that he has adopted and that he repents anirrevocable stepbe cheered lone replied the egyptian itis true that some little time since he was troubledand sad of spirit those doubts beset him whichwere likely to haunt one of that fervent pompeii rament which ever ebbs and flows and vibratesbetween excitement and exhaustion but ac lonehe came to me in his anxieties and his distress he sought one who pitied and loved him i havecalled his mind i have removed his doubts ihave taken him from the threshold of wisdom intoits temple and before the majesty of the goddesshis soul is hushed and soothed fear not he willrepent no more they who trust themselves to arfacesnever repent but for a momentyou rejoice me answered lone my dearbrother in his contentment i am happythe conversation then turned upon lighter subjects the egyptian exerted himself to please hecondescended even to entertain the vast varietyof his knowledge enabled him to adorn and lightup every subject on which he touched and loneforgetting the displeasing effect of his former ordswas carried away despite her sadness by themagic of his intellect her manner became unrestrainedand her language fluent and arbaceswho had waited his opportunity now hastened toseize it you have never seen said he the interior the last days ofof my home it may amuse you to do so it containssome rooms that may explain to you what youhave often asked me to describe â the fashion ofan egyptian house not indeed that you will perceivein the poor and minute proportions of romanarchitecture the massive strength the vast spacethe gigantic magnificence or even the domesticconstruction of the palaces of thebes and memphis but something there is here and there thatmay serve to express to you some notion of thatantique civilization which has humanized the worlddevote then to the austere friend of your youthone of these bright summer evenings and let meboast that my gloomy mansion has been honouredwith the presence of the admired loneunconscious of the pollutions of the mansion âof the danger that awaited her lone readily assentedto the proposal the next evening wasfixed for the visit and the egyptian with aserene countenance and a heart beating with fierceand unholy joy departed scarce had he gonewhen another visiter claimed admission â but nowwe return to glaucuspompeii chapter vthe poor tortoise â new changes for lydiathe morning sun shone over the small andodorous garden enclosed within the peristyle ofthe house of the athenian he lay reclined sadand listlessly on the smooth giass which intersectedthe viridarium and a slight canopy stretchedabove broke the fierce rays of the summer sunwhen that fairy mansion was first disinterredfrom the earth they found in the garden the shell ofa tortoise that had been its inmate that animalso strange a link in the creation to whom natureseems to have denied all the pleasures of life saveâ i do not know whether it be sill preserved i hope so butthe shell of a tortoise was found in the house appropriated inthis work to glaucus the last days oflifers passive and dreamlike perception had been theguest of the place for years before glaucus purchasedit for years indeed which went beyond thememory of man and to which tradition assignedan almost incredible date the house had beenbuilt and rebuilt â its possessors had changed andfluctuated â generations had flourished and decayedâ and still the tortoise dragged on its slow andunsjinpathizing existence in the earthquakewhich sixteen years before had overthrown manyof the public buildings of the city and scaredaway the amazed inhabitants the house now inhabitedby glaucus had been terribly shatteredthe possessors deserted it for many days on their return they cleared away the ruins whichencumbered the viridarium and found still thetortoise unharmed and unconscious of the surroundingdestruction it seemed to bear a charmedlife in its languid blood and imperceptiblemotions yet was it not so inactive as it seemed it held a regular and monotonous course inch byinch it traversed the little orbit of its domaintaking months to accomplish the whole gyrationit was a restless voyager that tortoise â patientlypompeii and with pain did it perform its selfappointedjourneys evincing no interest in the thingsaround it â a philosopher concentred in itselfthere was something grand in its solitaryselfishness â the sun in which it basked â thewaters poured daily over it â the air which itinsensibly inhaled were its sole and unfailingluxuries the mild changes of the season inthat lovely clime affected it not it covered itselfwith its shell â as the saint in his piety â as thesage in his wisdom â as the lover in his hopeit was impetuous to the shocks and mutationsof time â it was an emblem of time itself slow âregalar â perpetual emitting of the passions thatfret themselves around â of the wear and tear ofmortality

he smiledjoyously and then as he turned from his place ofvigil and sought his couch he muttered ifdeath froatis so near i avill say at least that ihave lived â lone shall be minethe character of arbaces was one of those intricateand varied webs in which even the mindthat sate within it was sometimes confused and perplexedin him the son of a fallen dynasty theoutcast of a sunken people was that spirit of discontentedpride which ever rankles in one of asterner mould who feels himself inexorably shutfrom the sphere in which his fathers shone and towhich nature as well as birth no less entitled the last days ofself this sentiment hath no benevolence it warswith society it sees enemies in mankind butwith this sentiment did not go its common companionpoverty arbaces possessed wealth whichequalled that of most of the roman nobles andthis enabled him to gratify to the utmost the passionswhich had no outlet in business or ambitiontravelling from clime to clime and beholding stillrome everywhere he increased both his hatred ofsociety and his passion for pleasure he was in avast prison which however he could fill with theministers of luxury he could not escape from theprison and his only object therefore was to give itthe character of the palace the egyptians fromthe earliest time were devoted to the joys of sense arbaces inherited both their appetite for sensualityand the glow of imagination which struck lightfrom its rottenness but still unsocial in his pleasuresas in his graver pursuits and brooking neithersuperior nor equal he admitted few to his companionshipsave the willing slaves of his profligacyhe was the solitary lord of a crowded harembut withall he felt condemned to that satietypompeii which is the constant curse of men whose intellectis above their pursuits and that which once hadbeen the impulse of passion froze down to the ordinanceof custom from the disappointments ofsense he sought to raise himself by the cultivationof knowledge but as it was not his object to servemankind so he despised that knowledge which ispractical and usefid his dark imagination lovedto exercise itself in those more visionary and obscureresearches which are ever the most delightfulto a wayward and solitary mind and to which hehimself was invited by the daring pride of his dispositionand the mysterious traditions of his climedismissing faith in the confused creeds of theheathen world he reposed the gilatest faith in thepower of human wisdom he did not know perhapsno one in that age distinctly did the limitswhich nature imposes upon our discoveries seeingthat the higher we mount in knowledge the morewonders we behold he imagined that nature notonly worked miracles in her ordinary course butthat she might by the cabala of some master soulbe diverted from that course itself thus he purthelast days ofsued science across her appointed boundaries intothe land of perplexity and shadow from thetruths of astronomy he wandered into astrologicfallacy from the secrets of chemistry he passedinto the spectral labyrinth of magic and he whocould be sceptical as to the power of the gods wascredulously

theformidable and profound arbaces his fame andhis discoveries avere known to all the cultivatorsof magic they even survived himself but itwas not by his real and worldly name that he washonoured by the sorcerer and the sage he receivedfrom their homage a more mystic appellationand was long remembered in magna graecaand the eastern plains by the name of hermesthe lord of the flaming belt his subtle speculationsand boasted attributes of wisdom recordedin various volumes were among those tokens ofthe curious arts which the christian convertsmost joyfully yet most fearfully burnt at ephesusdepriving posterity of the proofs of the cunning ofthe fiendthe conscience of arbaces was solely of the intellectâ it was awed by no moral laws if manimposed these checks upon the herd so he believed the last days ofthat man by superior wisdom could raise himselfabove them if he reasoned i have the geniusto impose laws have i not the right to commandmy own creations still more have i not the rightto control â to evade â to scorn â the fabrications ofyet meaner intellects than my on thus if hewere a villain he justified his villainy by whatought to have made him virtuous namely â theelevation of his capacitiesas all men have more or less the passion ofpower in arbaces that passion correspondedexactly to his character it was not the passionof an external and brute authority he desirednot the purple and the fasces the insignia of vulgarcommand his pride his contempt for romewhich made the world and whose haughty namehe regarded with the same disdain as that whichrome herself lashed upon the barbarian wouldnever have permitted him to aspire to sway overothers for that would have rendered him at once thetool or creature of the emperor he the son ofthe great race of rameses â he execute the ordersof and receive his power from another â the morepompeii notion filled him with rage but in rejecting anambition that coveted nominal distinctions he butindulged the more in the ambition to rule the hearthonouring mental power as the greatest of earthlygifts he loved to feel that power palpably in himselfby extending it over all whom he encounteredthus had he ever sought the young â thus had heever fascinated and controlled them he loved tofind subjects in men's souls â to rule over an invisibleand immaterial empire â had he been less sensualand less wealthy he might have sought to becomethe founder of a new religion as it was his energieswere checked by his pleasures besides howeverthe vague love of this moral sway vanity sodear to sages he was influenced by a singularand dreamlike devotion to all that belonged to themystic land his ancestors had swayed althoughhe disbelieved in her deities he believed in theallegories they represented or rather he interpretedthose allegories anew he loved to keepalive the worship of egypt because he thus maintainedthe shadow and the recollection of herpower he loaded therefore the altars of osiris'bss
