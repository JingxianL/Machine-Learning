friends mrnw and mrs franklin the first day at dinner an old gentlemanobserved that the pie dishes of wedgeswood's ware were good contrivances forj keeping vegetables hot and remarked how very like real pie crust one of themlookedmr frankland who had been an intimatefriend of the late mr westwood saidthat he was present the first day when oneof these imitations of pie crust appearedat dinner the children of the family did notvol ii bmistake it for a real pie and mr wedgwoodhad new ones made repeatedlytill at last one appeared so perfect that ata little distance it could not be knownfrom pie crust when i took off thecover said mr frankland the childnext me was agreeably surprised to hear itjingle on the dishbesides this said the old gentlemanmr wedgwood made a number of littleeveryday useful contrivances that dishin which there is a well for the gravyin the olden times unhappy carvers wereobliged to poke under the heavy sirloinfor gravy or to raise and slope the dishat the imminent hazard of overturning thesirloin and splashing the spectatorsknife fork spoon slipping all the whileone after another into the dish and tento one no gravy to be had after all nothingbut cakes of cold grease but nowwithout poking sloping splashing thehappy carver free from these miseries oflife has only to dip his spoon into a wellof pure gravy thanks to the inventionof one man all men women and childrenmay now have gravy without stoopingthe dish so i give you gentlemen andladies for a toast the late mr wedgwoodand the comforts of life after he had drank his glass of winethe old gentleman continued speaking i remember that mr come the travellerwas pleased by meeting with a beautifulservice of wedgwood ware in russia idare say he might find one now in siberialast year when i was in holland i learntthat even the town of delft which formany years used to furnish all europewith crockery is now supplied from englandwith our staffordshire warethe conversation next turned on chinaand chinese artists they are very exact said mr frankland in imitating whatever is bespokenfrom them but sometimes they carry thisto a degree of provoking stupidityof this he gave an instance a ladywanted to match some of the plates of ab remarkably handsome service of chinawhich had been given to her husband bythe east india company she sent apattern to china and bespoke some dozensto be made exactly the same in duetime they arrived were unpacked butto her surprise and mortification the ladyfound that every one of the new plates hadthe appearance of a crack across it andon examining the plate which had beensent as a pattern it was found that therewas a crack in it which had been exactlyimitatedeven harry though he loved exactnessthought this was too muchlucy observed the beauty of the chinaon her plate there lay or there seemed tolie a convolvulus it looked so natural thatshe thought she could take it up on hermother's was a celia a geranium on anotherand on harry's a honeysuckle ofwhich she could almost fancy that shesmelt the perfume even as she eat herripe cherries she paused to examine theseflowers she thought it the most beautifulchina she had ever seen when shewent into the drawingroom she saw onthe chimneypiece flowerpots of the mostdelicate blue with white figures on themembossed like ivory and exquisitely carvedthe drapery on the figures was so light thatit seemed as if blown by the wind and sotransparent that she could see the blueground through itmrs frankland came to lucy as shewas looking at these flowerpots and toldher that they were wedgwood's ware aswell as the plates which she had admiredat the dessertwedgwood's ware repeated lucyi thought that wedgwood's ware wasalways black or creamcoloured such asthe common yellowish platesmrs frankland told her there was a greatvariety of wedgwood's wares she tookher into a cabinet at the end of the where she showed her severalvases made in imitation of antiques whichhad been dug up from the ruins of etruriain italy and thence called etruscan somehad red grounds with black figures othersred figures on black grounds others whichwere called jasper were very valuableafter lucy had examined and admired allthese mrs frankland said she would showher another which was more valuable thanall the rest the original from which itwas exquisitely imitated cost the presentpossessor four thousand guineas as shespoke she opened the case which containedthe vase and carefully raised it from itscrimsoncushioned bedi know it i have seen it before mammaexclaimed lucyseen it before lucy said her motherwherein a book when i was reading to youmammayou mean that you have seen an engravingof it said her motheryes mamma you remember the threeviews in the botanic garden of a vase justlike this with a dark ground and whitefigures i cannot recollect the name of itbut i know it was dug up out of ruinsher mother told her it was called thebartering or portland vase barteringfrom the name of the italian family to whomit had belonged and portland from theduchess of portland by whom it had beenpurchased and brought to englandlucy whose memory was now awakenedrecollected dr darwin's beautiful linesaddressed to mr wedgwood oh friendof art but she refrained from repeatingthem for which harry gave her creditduemr frankland who now came into theroom told her that the ancient etruscanor greek vases were produced by a differentprocess from that which mr wedgwoodused in making his they appearto have been made by covering the partsrepresenting the figures and ornamentsafter their outlines had been traced andthen dipping the red ware in a black paintthe lines of the drapery c were afterwardstraced in the same colour in thoseancient vases the colour which was redwas in the body of the ware itself inmr wedgwood's imitations both the redand black are painted on the porcelain orrather on the biscuit the name which isgiven to the ware after its first baking inthe furnace he was the first person whomade what are called dry colours or enamelwithout lustre without shiningharry thought that the smoothness andpolish of these vases was more beautifulthan any glazingand much safer and more durablesaid mr frankland these colourscannot be injured by damp or fire or airor acid and will last as long as the substanceitself you may have observedthat the glazing on common earthenwareruns into little cracksyes said lucy i have often observedthem covering a plate like networkthey look very ugly but what is much worse continuedhe in most kinds of glazing lead is employedwhich when dissolved in certainacids is poisonouslucy observed that glazing looked somethinglike glass and from the sound of thewords too she heqvedi glazing came fromglass it might at first have been calledglassingyes said mr frankland and thereis as you observe a resemblance betweenthe outside of some porcelain and glassbut the difference between glass andporcelain is that porcelain is but that means half turned toglass the managing the heat so asto stop the vitrification or turning toglass at the right time is one of themost important points in making porcelainlucy returned to admire the beauty ofthe wedgwood's ware repeating that shethought it much prettier than chinesechinabbesides the beauty of form and colourand texture continued mr frankland the utility is great it is not onlyperfectly safe for all culinary purposes butmost durable for some chemical experimentsin which the vessels must be exposedto great heatmr frankland showed them a crucibleand a retort made of wedgwood's wareand mrs frankland showed a white pestleand mortar which looked like marble butwhich was of wedgwood's ware and usedfor pounding medicinesharry asked whether the potteries whereall these were made was near franklandhallyes within a few miles of us saidmr frankland at a village to whichmr wedgwood gave the name of etruriaand where he established a manufactorywhose productions are probably moreknown and more useful to a greater numberof people than ever were those of theancient etruriamr frankland said that he would thenext day take harry and lucy to see theseworks in the mean time as harry seemedanxious to know more he told him all thathe thought could interest him concerningthe history of the staffordshire potteriesthe clay of this part of england being fitfor making some kinds of earthen warethere have been potteries or remains ofpotteries in staffordshire ever since thetime when the romans were in britain but they had continued in a rude state foragesas no person of industry or knowledgehad attempted their improvementtill about a hundred and twenty years agowhen two brothers of the name of elderscame from holland settled here and manufactureda red unglazed porcelain afterwardsthey made a sort of brown glazedstone ware coarse and heavy yet the glazingof these such as it was could notbe performed without great inconveniencethey used muriate of soda whichthey threw into the oven at a certain timeof the baking of the vessels the fumesfrom this were so odious that the neighbourhoodwere alarmed and forced thestrangers to abandon their potteries andquit the country soon afterwards aworkman who had found out the secret oftheir mode of glazing for even that was asecret pursued the same method in a potteryof his own and this was suffered to goonin spite of the nauseous fumes becausethe inhabitants found the jars theymade so useful for holding their butterthey were employed chiefly for this purposeand the manufactory was called thebutter pottery on glazing days howeverthe nuisance was terrible the offensivefumes spread to a distance of six orseven miles thick clouds from thesefurnaces rose over the hills and filled thevalleys with their dense vapoursthe first great improvement in our potterieswas made in the substance of theware itself by introducing ground flints intothe composition and then was made whatis still called white stone ware it is usedfor many purposes you may have seenit for instance for seltzer water bottlesi know what you mean said lucythis was the safest and best ware wehad continued mr frankland beforemr wedgwood's time it is said that thefirst idea of using powdered flints wassuggested to a poor staffordshire potterby accident by accident i am glad of it saidlucy i like to hear of discoveriesmade by accident especially by poorpeoplethere was a staffordshire potterwhose name is forgotten or whose name iforget he stopped on a journey to londonat dunstable in bedfordshire where thesoil is flinty and chalky he consultedthe hostler of the inn where he stoppedabout some disorder in his horse's eyethe hostler advised that powdered flintshould be put into the eye and for this purposehe threw a flint into the fire to calcinethat is to burn it that it might bemore easily pulverized the potter whowas standing by observed the great whitenessof the calcined flint and being an ingeniousas well as an observing man immediatelythought of applying this circumstanceto the improvement of his potteryhe first tried the experiment of mixingfinelypowdered flints with tobacco pipeclay he succeeded to his hopes andmade white stone ware which put all thebrown and coloured stone ware out of fashionugly as you think it lucy it wasmuch approved till wedgwood came andgave us something better that creamcolouredware which was called queen'sware because it was first patronized byqueen charlotte it was then and notmany years ago prized in palaces now itis used in every cottage and known inevery place where plates or dishes are tobe found after this queen's ware he inventedall the varieties which you haveseen and many moremrs frankland rang the bell and orderedthe servant to bring a plate of creamcoloured wedgwood ware another of thewhite stone ware a crock of the darkglazed kind and a common red gardenpot these she placed in the order inwhich they had been made beside wedgwood'sbeautiful vases to show harry andlucy the difference and contrastand all these improvements or atleast the greatest part of them were madeby one man thought harry thenmore was done by him during his lifetimethan had been done in hundreds ofyears beforelucy asked if any lucky accidents hadhappened to mr wedgwood which putimprovements into his head or gave himthe first idea of any of his inventions shesaid she should like very much to knowthe story of these if mr frankland wouldtell it to hermr frankland said he did not know ofany such and observed that though oneor two fortunate accidents might occur tothe same person it was not possible thatsuch progressive improvements as mrwedgwood had made could have beensuggested by accident or accomplished byany one who had not scientific knowledge i should like very much said harryto know what he did first and what hedid next and how he went on from oneexperiment to another of all this i cannot pretend to giveyou a history said mr frankland fori am not sure that i know it clearly myselfall can tell you is that he improvedthe potteries by the introduction ofsubstances which had not before been employedin the composition of these waresit had been found that some cornwallgranite is as good for making porcelainof a certain kind as the clay which thechinese use mr wedgwood introduceddorsetshire and cornwall claysperhaps you could tell me sir saidlucy how the delicate blue of theground of this flowerpot is made that is given by a substance calledcobalt said mr frankland but asyou have never seen it the word cobaltteaches you littlei wish i knew said lucy how thebeautiful colours of the flowers on thedessert plates and how the purple androse colours on this cup are produced the purple and rose colours are givenby the precipitate of gold dissolved in nitromuriaticacid the oxides of iron also producemany of the colours which you admiredbut as you are not acquainted with any ofthe oxides of iron or with nitric or muriaticacid or with the precipitate of gold youknow nothing more from my answer thananumber of names which probably youwill not be able to remember an hour andwhich unless you learn their propertiescould be of no use to you even if youcould keep them in your head all yourlifebut without telling us all those hardnames sir said lucy could not yougive us some general idea of how he didit allmr frankland smiled and answeredthat he did not exactly know what shemeant by a general idea of it all hecould tell her only that mr wedgwood inthe first place learnt the properties of differentclays and minerals and what effectwould be produced on these by fire inshort he applied to the study of chemistryand mineralogy to learn all the experimentswhich had been made by others andthen he tried new ones for himself but ifhe had not read and acquired this knowledgefirst he might have wasted his timeand ingenuity in doing what others haddone before him besides genius to inventnew and elegant things he had thefood sense to observe what is wantedevery day by the greatest number of peopleso that he not only produced whatpleased persons of taste but what was usefulto all classes and he continually consideredhow he could improve not only whatothers made but what he had himself producedit was by this attention to littleas well as to great objects and by steadilyadhering to one course of pursuits thathe succeeded in accomplishing all that hebegan no small praise for a man whoundertook so much the consequences ofhis success we all know continued mrfrankland turning to harry's father andwe all rejoice in them wedgwood made alarge fortune for himself and his childrenwith a character a reputation above allfortune he increased amazingly the industrywealth and comforts of the poorin his neighbourhood multiplied the convenienceselegancies and luxuries of lifefor the rich raised at home and abroadthe fame of the arts and manufactures ofhis own country extended her commerceand spread his own name with his productionsto the most remote regions of thecivilized worlda pause ensued after these words alllooked with admiration at his worksand those who had known him intimatelysighed for the loss of an excellent man anda kind friend the next day mr frankland took harryand lucy to see the works at etruriawe shall not follow them through all theprocesses but shall only mention whatharry and lucy recollected and told theirmother on their returnthe first thing i remember saidharry is the improvement in the way ofgrinding the flints but you must know mother in thefirst place said lucy that formerly thiswas very unwholesome work such a quantityof the dust of the powdered flint flewoff and as the workmen breathed it wentin at their mouths or up their noses andit brought on complaints in their lungsand stomachs and inflamed their eyesbesidesall this was remedied continuedharry by grinding the flints in waterwhich prevented the dust from flying offthe name of the man who made this improvementand who made the first mill onthis principle was brindled and the millis very ingeniousbut you had better not stop to describethat said lucy because perhapsmamma does not care as much about itas you do now let me go on harryand tell a little well mamma the flintsground in the great cauldron mill said harrymixed with water continued lucylooked at first like chalk and waterthickish then by mixing with clay and bystirring and beating and straining throughsieves this became first a sort of pulpand then about as thick as paste or doughr and then it was ready for the man to carryvto the potter's wheel you know the mamma i remember firstseeing the print of it in our book of tradesbut there is an improvement in this thevery common one which i once saw longago was only a circular board turning on aperpendicular stickaxis said harrya boy whirled it round for the manyou know mamma while he went onmoulding the clay upon it into a bowl andhe called to the boy to make it go sloweror faster but in this potter'swheel noboy to whirl the board is wanting for it isturned by a shaftand that shaft is turned by a steamengine said harry the steam enginemother at work again observe motheryes said lucy papa called it thegreat servant of all workbut there was an improvement in thispotter's wheel which you have not toldyet lucy said harryno no but i am coming to it let metell it said lucyif you understand it whispered harryin a very kind tone as he was onlyafraid for her not anxious to show what heknewi understand one thing about it andthat is all i want to tell my dear said lucythere was a sort of large roller in theshape of a cone mamma opposite to thepotter's wheel and a strap or band roundit that could slide or be pushed up anddown upon this cone from the narrowestpart to the thickest harry took notice ofthis the moment he saw it and asked theuse of it papa bid him find out and hedid mamma it was to make the wheelgo slower or quicker whenever the manwho was moulding the clay desired that itshould this was necessary because thesteamengine which keeps the potter'swheelin motion goes on always at its ownregular rate and would never mind hiscalling out faster slower slower faster therefore he must have somewayof slackening or quickening the wheelwithout interfering with the steam enginethis is done for him by a boy's simplyshifting that strap i described to youhigher or lower to the thicker or thinnerpart of the cone this was the usemamma of the cone and band and harryfound it outi am glad you remember this my dearlucy said her motherthank you said harry's eyeslucy went on with raised spiritsmamma i wish you had seen the manmoulding the clay and all the metamorphosesof the potter'swheel first inone minute the lump of clay turned intoa bowl then the instant after he squeezedthis soft bowl up in his hand dashed iton the wheel and again he turned andmoulded and in an instant it was aplate in another instant the plate wasgone and in its stead a cup stood beforeusa cup without a handle said harrythe handle if wanted must be madeseparately and stuck on afterwards onlycertain shaped things round or flat aremade on the potter'swheel those whichhave isis and outs in their shapes are madein moulds into which the moist clay issqueezed sometimes two parts of a thingthe spout of a teapot for instance aremade in separate moulds and the halvesjoined together afterwards but i daresaymother you know all this i knew most of this myself beforecontinued lucy from the printsand descriptions in our dear book oftrades and from some others of our littleand large books but i liked to see thereal work going on and the real thingsthere was always some difference betweenthe description and the reality or somethingthat i fancied larger or smaller thanit is or some little particular circumstancewhich i did not comprehend till i saw itmamma i did not tell you that we sawthe furnaces and kilns for baking firingthe porcelain as they call it these weremuch larger than i expected when theporcelain has been once baked it is calledfecwiy in which state it is ready for paintingmamma i have not told you how much was entertained in the painting room byseeing how dull the colours look when theyare first laid on and how bright and brilliantthey are after they have been fired vol ii cwhat was to be gold was quite dark beforehandpray lucy said harry did youobserve a man alio was standing besideone of the furnaces whose business seemedto be to regulate the heat he had somelittle bits of clay which looked like littlestoppers and he put these into the fire andmeasured them did you see how no i saw the man said lucy buti did not know what he was doing wellmamma there is one other thing i rememberand that is all you know the commonkind of blue and white cups and saucersand plates with windmills and housesand strange chinese looking figures andall manner of things upon themi do know luckily what you meansaid her mother laughing otherwise iam not sure that i should know it fromyour description mamma these were formerly paintedone at a time by hand but now there is amuch quicker way mr frankland showedit to me first the patterns whateveryou wish houses or churches or geese orturkies or shepherdesses or elephants orwindmills are printed on paperengraved on copper first said harryand the blue colour put upon the copperplateinstead of printer's inkand the blue colour oh let me tellthat harry cried lucy the blue colouris made of cobalt oxide of cobalt i believe said harry which differs from cobalt mr franklandtold us if you recollect lucy asmuch as rust differs from iron well oxide of cobalt it should be irecollect said lucy and this is mixedwith some earth and and linseed oil said harry likewhat is used in printer's inkand when it is altogether about asthick and soft as paste it is put on thecopperplate you know mamma youshowed me common engraving once andjust like any common engraving this isdone as many copies of patterns aretaken off on paper as you wantcyou forgot that the paper was smearedfirst with soft soap said harry then when you want to use thesepatterns said lucy the superfluouspaper is cut off and the printed part ismoistened and laid on the cup or whateveryou wish to put it on the cup must be in the state of biscuitremember said harrybiscuit to be sure said lucy thebiscuit instantly sucks in absorbs the colouringstuff from the moistened pattern then the paper is washed off and you seethecoloured pattern printed on the cupdirectly is not that nice and quick mamma then the cup must be let todry and afterwards it is dipped in somesort of glazing stuff and the cobalt i meanthe oxide of cobalt comes out a beautifulblue and there is the cup finishedpainted in this easy expeditious way ahundred thousand i dare say could bepainted in this manner while a personcould paint one single cup in the oldwaythe name of the ingenious person asmr frankland said who discovered thismethod of transferring engraving frompaper to earthenware has not been preservedand i am sorry for it added harry mr frankland told us that since thisinvention this blue and white ware hasbeen made in such quantities and so cheapthat now almost every body can afford tobuy it and it is in every cottage and thepoor people can have now what only therich and grand had formerly are not youvery glad of that mammayes i am my dear said her mother and i am glad added she smilingthat you give yourself time to take breathat last and that you allow me time tothank you for all you have told me youseem to have been very much entertainedat the potteries and you have entertainedme by your account of them mamma said lucy do you thinkwe have remembered enough i know icannot recollect half what i saw and heardbut i remember almost all that i understoodclearly that is quite enough my dear saidher mother i never wish you to remembermore than you understand of whatuse could it be good morning to you mamma saidlucy i forgot to tell you yesterdaywhen we were talking about the potteriesthat we saw the house in which mrwedgwood formerly lived and a verynice house it isgood morning to you father saidharry do you recollect yesterday seeinga man standing by one of the furnacesmeasuring some little stoppers of bakedclay which he slid in between two piecesof brass like the two parts of a hingedruler these pieces of brass were fixedbut not parallel to each other they werecloser together at one end than at theother the man took the bits of clay orstoppers out of a heated furnace and hetried each stopper between these rulesand looked at divisions which were markedon the brass plates what was he doingpapahe was using a sort of thermometerharry said his father a thermometer of clay papa saidlucyyes for measuring higher degrees ofheat than can be shown by that thermometerwhich you have seen if that wereexposed to heat beyond the highest degreemarked on its scale the quicksilver wouldexpand so as to burst the glass and theglass would melt if put into one of thosefurnaces which you saw yesterday butthese clay thermometers can bear and canmeasure the heat of the fire for whichreason it is called a pyrometer that ismeasurer of fire heati am glad i know the name and whatit means said lucy father said harry will you be sogood as to explain the pyrometer to me harry will you be so good as to useyour own understanding said his father from what you have seen and from whati have just told you you know enough tocomprehend or invent the rest withoutany further explanation from meharry was silent and considered firstits use he had seen the man put thestopper into the furnace and then measureit between the rulers and afterwards sayto another workman the man who wasfeeding the furnace this heat will donow thought harry what change couldhave been made in the clay after it hadbeen put into the furnace and how did hemeasure it when he pushed it in betweenthe two rulers he must have tried whetherit had grown larger or smaller afterhaving been put into the fire i think said harry that perhapssome sorts of clay either shrink or growlarger when they are put into the fire ifthey did so always regularly and if peoplefound this after a number of trials thenthey might know the heat of the fire bythe quantity which the clay had shrunk orincreased in size if this is the case withthose bits of clay that i saw they wouldbe promoters or measurers of fire heat asyou said i mean if you had the degreesmarked upon the ruler to measure themexactly so said his father you areright as far as you have gone still thereis a part of the pyrometer which you havenot explained to me you observed thatthe rulers were not parallel to each other do you think that was done by accident oron purpose vi think it must have been on purposethey seem to have been screwed down onthe plate firmly like a ruler partly openthen if they were placed so on purposefor what purpose asked his fatherthat the different degrees of shrinkingmight be measured as the stoppers arepushed in said harry the person whofirst made the pyrometer must have triedexperiments and must have marked thedifferent degrees which the clay shrinksc with different heats but i do not knowby what parts of an inch or by what scaleit is made the rulers seemed to me tobe about two feet longthey are said his father and theopening at the widest end is fivetenthsand at the narrowest threetenths of aninch and so that this proportion is keptit does not signify what inches or feet maybeused in the length of the rulers thebits of clay which you saw exactly fit intothe widest opening before they have beenused and they shrink according to thedegree of heat to which they are exposedif it is greater than that in which they werefirst slightly baked then papa they can only show agreater degree of heat not a lesser and ifthey do not swell out again to the formersize they are of no use after they havebeen in a great heat said lucyof none replied he fresh stoppersmust be continually used that is a great inconvenience saidlucy because you must drag about thisweight of stoppers not like a nice portablethermometer in its little case but it has so many convenienceslucy said her father that we may wellpardon that one disadvantageone great convenience i see saidharry the stopper always remains of thesame size after it is taken out of the fireso that there is no danger of making mistakesabout it you may measure it overand over again but the quicksilver variesso that if you do not write down the degreeaccurately you are undone this pyrometer continued his fatheris chiefly used in manufactories or bychemists in their laboratories it has beenof great use to mr wedgwood who madeit from feeling the want of such a measurein his potteries it was necessary that heshould know at what heats certain claysmelt or vitrify that is you know turn toglass the common workmen's expressionsfor this such as red heat or whiteheat he found so inaccurate that in tryingexperiments many things were spoiled forwant of that exact measure which his barometernow gives by it he has ascertainedwhat heat all kinds of porcelainscan bear without breaking or melting orturning to glass what is of still moreuse he can ascertain the exact degree ofheat required for baking or as they callit firing any kinds of porcelain or earthenwareof which he could obtain any specimenwhether made in this or in foreigncountries as mr wedgwood said in describingit it speaks the language of allnations the advantage of having an accurateuniversal measure in any casemuch as it pleases you now will pleaseyou more when your knowledge enlargesand when you see the further uses to whichit can be applied papa i remember seeing said lucyin scientific dialogues the descriptionof a pyrometer but i do not think that itws made of clay no that pyrometer is different saidher father that measures by the expansionof metal bars with different degreesof heat which is shown by the motiongiven to an indexlike the hygrometer said lucyyes and there are several differentkinds of promoters of which you can readthe description at your leisure continuedher father in any encyclopedia if youhave any curiosity about themyes said harry i should like tocompare them and see which is best if icouldthat would be a good exercise of yourjudgment harry said his father butthere are so many they might tire andpuzzle youthe clay of which mr wedgwood'spromoters are made continued his fatherpossesses some properties which fit itpeculiarly for the purpose to which it hasbeen judiciously applied those halfburntbits of it which you saw harrymay be dropped at once into intense firewithout cracking ands when they have receivedits heat may be plunged into coldwater without the least injury in aboutthree minutes they acquire all the heatfrom any fire which they are capable ofreceiving so as to contract as much asthey ever will from that degree of heatthey may afterwards be left in that heatas long as you please for they will notchange take them out and they can asyou have seen be cooled in a few secondsand are then ready for measuring in thegauge or scalehow very convenient said harrybut as each promoterbit can be usedbut once there ought to be a constantfresh supplythere are large beds of this clay incornwall said his father and to easeyour mind harry on this subject i can tellyou that mr wedgwood offered to givethe royal society a sufficient space of abed of that clay to supply the world withpyrometer pieces for agesi like that very much cried lucyi cannot bear that people who discoverscientific things should be covetous ofthem or afraid that others should have ashare how could you ever think of such athing said harryi never should have thought of itsaid lucy only that i heard a gentlemanonce at aunt pierrepoint's say buti believe i had better not tell it becauseit can do no good to any body butharry i hope and i am sure that if everyou invent or discover any thing you willbe ready to let others share with youthat i will said harry oh iwish it was come to that father thereis something else i want to say but i donot know how to express it it is thati think that a person who invents anypyrometer or hygrometer or barometeror new and exact instrument for measuringheat or cold or height or quantitydoes more service than a person whoinvents only a machine which will doonly for some particular purpose becausethose measuring instruments willassist a great many other people in theirexperiments for years perhaps for agesto come do you understand what imean papayes my dear and i think what yousay is very true but do not twist thepoor button of my coat any more or youwill pull it off and let me go now forthere is the breakfastbellwho will be down stairs first criedlucy letting go her button and runningforemost harry might have overtakenher perhaps in a race across the hall butthat he stopped to hold open a swingdoorfor mrs frankland she had in herhand two small packets one of which shegave to him and the other to lucy onopening the paper in which these werewrapped they found two cameos ofwedgwood's ware lucy's which wasblack on a white ground represented anegro in chains kneeling with his handsraised in a supplicating manner withthis motto engraved am i not a man and a brotherjharry's cameo was all of one colourbrown it represented three allegoricalfigures peace art and labour and itwas made of clay which had been broughtfrom botany bay mr wedgwood madeuse of this clay as mrs frankland toldharry on purposeto show the settlersand inhabitants of that country whatcould be made of their materials by industryand ingenuity and thus he encouragedthem to exert themselves ofthese cameos the late mr wedgwood distributedmany hundreds and no doubtconsiderable effect was produced by the poor fettered slave on bended kneefrom britain's sons imploring to be freelucy you have not seen our gardenyet said mrs frankland we had nottime yesterday but if you are fond of agarden come with us now your motherand i are going there oh thank you ma'am said lucy but i must call harry and we willfollow you directlythey followed and a gay garden itwas full of a variety of brightcolouredflowers rich beds of carnations and rosesin full blowroses moss roses in full blow inseptember cried lucy the day beforeshe had left home she had searchedtheir garden for a rose for her motherbut could find only one poor solitary budwhich had a yellow nightcap on sheasked mrs frankland to tell her howshe contrived to make her roses blow solate in autumnby pulling off some of the buds inspring said mrs frankland as soonas they begin to form and by transplantingsome of the rose trees early inthe spring so as to prevent them fromflowering at that time then they blow inautumnlucy said she would try this nextspring on her own two rose treesnot on both will you said harrylet us pull the buds off one and leavethem on the other then it will be a fairexperiment and besides you may then have achance said mrs frankland of thefirst rose of spring as well as the lastrose of summerlucy took notice of some large clustersof bright blue flowers aga pant has andvarieties of dahlias she thought thembeautiful but she supposed that thesecould not be had without a great dealof trouble and money and a hothouse oragardener at least but mrs franklandsaid these did not require a hothouseor even a gardener's skill indeedsaid she all the flowers in this gardenexcepting perhaps certain carnationswhich my gardener prizes highly though do not may be had by any body wltk alittle care and exertion of their ownby any body repeated lucy butma'am do you mean bodies like us likeharry and me with only our own hands yes bodies like you said mrsfrankland with your own hands providedyou use your heads as well as yourhandsin what way must we use our heads said lucy will it be very difficult no consult your gardener's dictionaryand follow its directions only rememberto do so at the right time of yearsaid mrs frankland she told lucythat she would give her the root of anagapantha and of some dahlias andthat she and harry were welcome toseeds roots cuttings or slipping ofany thing they liked in this gardenwrite down what you wish and i willhave them ready by the time your motherbrings you here again as i hope she willon your return homewardsjoy sparkled in their eyes and theythanked mrs frankland with warm gratitudebut an instant afterwards theylooked unusually grave for the embarrassmentof riches came upon them theywere left to make out their list and howto choose was the difficulty where allwere beautiful and when their littlegarden could not hold all harry wentto work prudently he measured out aspace of ground that was the size oftheir own garden lucy could hardlybelieve that it was so small as what henow showed her but he had oftenstepped the boundaries and was sureof the size of their territories rule andmeasure soon settled the affair andbrought their wishes into proper compassthey calculated what their garden wouldhold and made out their list accordinglytheir chief wish was to have a great bedof pinks and carnationsbut the moment they went near thesean old gardener who was at work in thegarden and who had long been eyeingthem approached he began to praisehis carnations which he said were thefinest in the county and he pointed outhis favourites there was the princeregent and the duke of wellington infull glory these every body knew butbeyond these he had two superlative newfavourites one he called the pride ofholland or the great van tromp theother the envy of the world or the greatpanjandrum harry and lucy did notmuch admire either of these van trompthey thought was of a dull colour andthe great panjandrum had burst and wasfalling to pieces in spite of his card supportharry preferred some othersthat which you are now at mastersaid the gardener is davy's duchessof devonshire that little duchess wasthought a great deal of some years agobut she is quite out of fashion nowharry did not care for that he liked her what does he say asked the deafgardener turning to lucy and leaningdown that he might hear the answer i say cried harry speaking loud inhis ear that i like my little duchessbetter than your great panjandrumindeed said the gardener smilingin scorn why master what you havetaken such a fancy to is not a carnationeven it is only a pinki do not care said hairy whatyou call it i like it whether it be calledcarnation or pinkthe gardener looked at him with contemptpray what is the difference betweenthem said lucy my mother has toldme but i forget itthe gardener told her that one chiefdifference is in the roundness of thepetals of carnations and the jagged orpinked edges of the petals of pinkslucy liked these edges and she reallythought some of the pinks prettier thanthe carnations she told harry so in alow voice but i am afraid said shethat the gardener would despise me ifhe heard me say sowhat signifies whether he despisesyou or not said harry there isnothing wrong in liking a pink betterthan a carnationthe gardener who did not hear whatwas said fancied that they were debatingwhether they should ask for one of hisgrand pan jan drums and he began to saythat he was sorry that he could not offerthis he could not give this to any bodyharry assured him that he need notmake any apology because they didnot wish for them piqued by harry'sindifference the gardener named severallords and ladies who had admired hispanjandrum above all things and whohad tried in vain to obtain it it was avery great rarity he said only two otherpeople in england had a real panjandrumharry liked flowers for being prettyand did not care whether they were rareor notthe gardener did not believe himsoon afterwards he offered harry somepinks of a kind which he liked particularlybut master i can let you have themonly upon condition that you promisenot to give any cuttings or layers of themto any oneharry drew back with disdain and saidhe would make no such promisethe gardener said that unless he wouldhe should not have the pinksthen said harry i will do withoutthemhe turned off abruptly and walkedaway but lucy stood still and said i believe we may have themmrs frankland told us we might haveany thing in this garden that we choose and here she is coming back from theorchardoh that alters the case said thegardener with a look of some mortification then master you must choosewhat you will to be surevol ir dharry turned back and walked composedlyalong the sides of the carnationbeds writing down the names of thosehe chose on a bit of paper thegardener breathed freely when harrypassed by the panjandrum and turned hisback upon the envy of the worldlucy whispered to her brother didyou see how much he was afraid thatyou should have chosen any of thosethat are really valuable and why didnot you because i did not like them and idespise his mean reasons for liking themsaid harry putting the paper and pencilinto her hands now go lucy andchooselucy admiring her brother's independencefollowed his example and chosewhat she liked without being influencedby the foolish wish of possessing whatother people cannot procure she did notchoose either the pride of holland or theenvy of the worldharry was quite right to adhere to hisown taste were was no trial of complaisanceor generositymrs frankland and their mother nowreturned from the orchard and harry andlucy gave mrs frankland their list shelooked it over said she thought they hadchosen well and had been moderate intheir requests she called to her gardenergave him the paper and desired him tohave the plants in readiness at the timeshe mentionedvery well ma'am he answered coollylooking over the list which he saw wasonly of common flowers but when sheadded that he must also give some dutchhyacinths and tulip roots the gardener'swhole countenance changed he exclaimedmy dutch tulips and hyacinths andthrowing down a hoe that he had in hishand he walked off muttering to himselfthat it was well his mistress's head wasnot loose or she would give it awaymrs frankland laughed goodhumouredat his anger she bore with himdrshe said because he was an old and faithfulservant who had been long in the familybefore she was married thoughyou might not think it said she he isgenerous to his relations of all that belongsto himself and covetous only of whatbelongs to the garden of which he considershimself as guardian against his mistress'sextravagance but i cannot bearthis sort of petty avarice and rivalshipabout flowers in persons whose educationought to have raised them above such illiberalityi have heard of a lady whowhen she was asked by a friend for theroots of some particularly fine flowerashamed to refuse yet unwilling to giveboiled the roots before she sent them toprevent the possibility of their growingharry expressed the greatest indignationagainst this meannessthey now entered the conservatoriesand observed the flowers of a plant whichhung over the entrance of the peachhousethey looked as if they were cut out ofthick velvet and were covered with honeytheir smell which had been pleasant atfirst soon became disagreeable and overpoweringmrs frankland told lucythat this plant is called hoy a carlos hoyafrom the name of mr hoy the gardenerwho introduced it into england and carnosefrom the fleshy appearance of theflower she had planted it at the door ofthe peachhouse because it is there a usefulguard wasps are so fond of its honey thatthey will for this leave untouched peachesand grapes after they had seen thepeachhouse they walked through theconservatory where mrs frankland pointedout a tree called the papaw tree caricapapaya which had been brought to herlately from the west indies the gentlemanwho gave it to her told herthat it will grow twenty feet in threeyears that its juice has the singular propertyof making meat tender if the juicebe rubbed on beef it makes it as tender asveal and if an old fowl be hung onthe trunk of this tree it becomes in a fewhours as tender as a young chicken thisit is affirmed is a fact which has been longknown to those who have resided in thewest indies but mrs frankland saidas she had not yet tried the experimentshe could not assert it to be trueat this moment harry put his hand tothe mouth of one of the flues or pipes inthe conservatory and perceived that warmair came through it but mrs franklandtold him that this air was not well heatedand therefore did not heat the buildingas it ought she said that a man wasjust going to alter and she hoped to improvethem harry heard his father talkingto this man at the other end of theconservatory and he went to see what wasdoingshis father turned to him and askedwhether if he were to place the pipe hewould put it at the top or the bottom ofthe buildingharry answered at the bottom becausei know that heated air is lighter thanair that is not heated and therefore if it isletin at the bottom of the building it willmix with the colder air and graduallywarm the whole house as it rises to thetopas lucy walked on with harry sheasked him how he knew that hot air islighter than cold as you might know said harry ifyou recollect a diversion we were fond ofwhen we were children and which i shouldlike this minute he puffed out his cheeksand blew through his hand as he turnedhis face up towards the sky blowing bubbles you mean saidlucy but what then what do you think makes the bubblego up said harryit goes up because it is lighter thanthe airand how comes that what is itfilled withit is filled with air from the mouthblown through a tobacco pipewell whether it is blown through atobacco pipe or not said harry is theair from your mouth hotter or colder thanthe outer air do you think when thebubble rises oh hotter to be sure now i knowwhat you mean the bubbles go up becausethey are filled with heated air indeedi might have known from this thatheated air is lighter than cold air but idid not recollect it at the right momenti wonder how you came to remember itso wellharry said that besides the bubblesanother thing fixed it in his mind athing which he had seen when she wasaway from home a fire balloon whichwent up because it was filled with heatedair he was one of the persons employedto hold the great bag of the balloonover a fire made of straw it wasall flaccid at first said he as myfather called the bladder which you mayremember he showed usyes said lucy and if your balloonwere filled with heated air it would expandi know that yes but you do not know how itpulled said harry i felt it beginningto pull against my hands as it filled outand at last when it was quite full it pulledso hard that i could scarcely hold it buti was desired to hold fast and i didthough my knuckles were burning theinstant papa cried let go we all loosed itand up it went to a great height quite intothe clouds oh the pleasure of seeing itgo up and the pain of my knuckleswhich were all blistered fixed the wholein my mind so that you need not wonderat my remembering itwhile they were talking in this mannertheir father was still speaking to the workmenabout the stove of the hothouse theyjoined him and listened to what he wassaying the man was asking mr franklandif he had seen the new method ofheating houses used in a neighbouringtownhe had and admired it muchit had been first attempted at the house ofthe gentleman by whom it had been inventedwhich it warmed most comfortablydthen it was tried at die county infirmarywhere it also succeeded to the satisfactionof the medical men and the patientsit was the invention of a gentlemanwho has for many years exertedhis great knowledge of mechanics forpurposes of domestic comfort and whohas in the most liberal manner devotedhis wealth his time and his inventivegenius to public works useful to his nativetown in particular and to mankind ingeneralat this moment they were interruptedsome visitors had arrived and they returnedto the house when harry wentinto the room he saw ladies with no bonnetson their heads and one with artificial flowersin her hair though not much skilled insuch matters he thought this looked as ifthese people were not merely morning visitorsbut would stay to dinner for whichas lucy knew by lies face he was verysorrythe next time they were alone togetherin their mother's dressing room inotheevening after the company were gonelucy asked her brother if he had not beenunhappy all day since the time they wereinterrupted at the stove but harry saidthat on the contrary he had been veryhappy and that he had heard several entertainingthingsat first said he when i saw thatwoman with the artificial flowers in herhead i thought it would be a companyday and that it was all over with usthat lady was very goodnatured tomesaid lucy in telling me somethingabout the artificial flower which she woredid you observe itnot i said harry yes i believei did see it it was like a lilac and i wasglad it had no smell for i dislike thesmell of lilac in a room but what did shetell you about itthat she brought it from italy sheasked me to guess of what it was made ilooked close and i touched it for she toldme that i might it was not paper norsilk nor gauze nor cambric i could notguess what it was though i had an indistinctrecollection of having seen somethinglike it somewhere it was made of thecocoons of silk worms in italy you knowthey have great quantities of these in thesilk worm's own country and it is well tomake use of them instead of throwingthem awayyes said harry if there must beartificial flowers and i suppose there mustthat lady gave also an entertaining accountof some travellers who were stoppedby banditti between rome and naplesyes said lucy and of the littlegirl who had her mother's jewels given to herto take care of and who concealed them inher doll's cradle and who kept rocking thecradle and talking to her doll all the timethe robbers were searching the carriage sothat they never suspected where the jewelswere and went away without finding themi do not think i could have had courage orpresence of mind to have done that iwish i couldyou do not know till you are triedwhether you could or not said harrybut what was i going to say i cannotrecollect said lucy oh i wasgoing to ask whether you heard what thatlady told me about straw bonnets not i said harry i heard herbeginning to say something about the priceand the fineness of hats women's businessthought i to which i need not listenyet it was worth hearing said lucythough it was about bonnets gentlemenlistened as well as ladiesi am ready to listen now said harry in the first place harry do you knowwhat leghorn bonnets areyes i believe i do a sort of strawhats i know the things when i see themsaid harryvery well and you must know toothat ladies think they are much better becausedearer than others said lucy noi mean much dearer because better which is it are you sure saidharry laughingquite sure said lucy they arereally better they wear much longer andbear wetting and crumpling they areinfinitely betteryou know best i am satisfied saidharry that is settled they are dearerbecause they are better go onand they must be much dearer thanthe common straw bonnets which are madein england you know because they arebrought from a great distance from italy aye from leghorn i suppose fromtheir name said harry yes at leghorn first i believe andfor a long long time hundreds of yearsi dare say ever since such hats have beenworn people never thought of its beingpossible to make them anywhere but initaly the straw is plaited differentlyand they thought that sort of straw couldbe got nowhere but there in short theynever thought of looking or trying whatthey could do till lately but now peoplehave found out first in america i believethen in england and at last in ireland poor ireland they have found a sort ofgrass the straw of which will do and theyhave learned how to plait it as well as theyplait it in italy that lady showed ustwo bonnets her own and her daughter's her own she brought from italy and herdaughters was made in ireland and as wellas i could see the irish one was the finestof the two and much better judges than iam and people who looked through spectaclesand held magnifying glasses tothem said the same several ladies inireland as she told us have taken a greatdeal of pains to teach poor girls this strawmanufacture one lady who learned howto do it herself from some directions in acommon newspaper set to work and triedexperimentssensible woman said harryand good said lucy for it was todo good and after a great many trialsshe made a bonnet from the very beginningwith her own hands from the firstpreparing the straw to the finishing andshe won the prize for this the best thatever was made i believeoh now lucy do not go too farhow do you know said harryi tell you just what was told me my dearthat a person who saw it and compared itwith one which had been sent from italyto some french princess declared that theirish hat was full as good as the finest offine leghorn hats which cost fifty guineasand this irish hat was made of a verycommon grass called crested dogstailwhich grows even on bad ground itsflower stalks are so remarkably harsh andtough that cattle will not touch themthough they will eat the dry stalks of manyother sorts of grass but these remain allwinter in the fields useless and they arecalled in irish trawnyeens when a thingcynosure cristatusis worth nothing the irish say it is not wortha trawnyeen but now trawnyeens are madegood for something and for a great dealtoowould you know the grass if youwere to see it said harryyes said lucy i know it verywell and i will show it to you the nexttime we are in any field where it isdo said harry i like the womanwho stuck to the bonnet till she had succeededshe succeeded in doing a great dealmore than making one fine bonnet thatwould have been no great matter only ingenioussaid lucy but i will tell youmuch more and much better this kindlady taught several poor irish girls to makethese hats and two not older than fourteenworking in their own cottages cabinsthey called them made in one yeartwelve bonnets and besides they did allthe work that was wanted in the houseas usual their twelve bonnets were soldfor a guinea a piece a great manysuch have been bespoken and are to besent over to london the children ofthose poor irish who as you knows weheard were almost starving last winterhave now one good way by which they mayearn guineas for their fathers and mothersthat is good indeed said harryi am sure that woman who made the firstbonnet and taught them all must be gladyes i am sure i should if i were inher place said lucy and harrymamma told me that if i can learn to dothis plaiting i may teach it to our poorwidow wilson's daughters today i sawa little bit of it which the lady who toldus all this brought in her workbag shelet me undo a bit of it to see how it wasdone and she gave us some straw and webegan to try now i know said harry why youwere all plaiting straw so eagerly i couldnot think what had seized you wheni saw you all so busy with straws wheni came back from playing but nowlucy to go to another thing for we havesaid enough about this did you observethe old gentleman who sat in the armchairby the fireside the same gentleman who the first dayat dinner talked of wedgwood's ware andof vegetable pie dishes said lucy yes i saw him indeed he took agreat quantity of snuff and i could notbearwhatit oh horrible harry his pockethandkerchief i did not see it said harry i am glad of it said lucy i donot like himyou do not like him my dear i assureyou said harry he is a very sensibleman for i heard him talking to myfather and mr frankland about stovesand flues and fire places and hot air very likely said lucy but i wishthat he had not had those two greatstreaks of snuff along the wrinkles of hiswaistcoatnever mind that said harry iwant to tell you something entertaining hetold me well do then i would rather hear itfrom you than from him said lucy ihope harry you will never take snuffno no my dear no dangerbut when you grow old my deargreat danger so many old people doand young too now i will tell you thenames of all the snuff takers i knowno no no my dear lucy saidharry stopping his ears pray do notbut let me tell you about a little birda little bird oh that is anotheraffair i thought you were going only totell me about stoves what about a littlebirdit was about stoves too said harryyou must hear that before you come tothe bird do you recollect some onesaid that there was a disagreeable smellfrom a stove in the passageyes said lucy and the people beganto debate whether it was a smell ofsmoke or of burnt airthen it was that my old gentlemanasked if they knew what is meant by burntairy and he began and told of a doctorsomebody who tried some experiments todetermine whether heated iron gives outany thing unwholesome to air that passesover it or whether it takes any thing awayfrom it so as to make it in short unfit forour breathingso he took a bird i suppose saidlucystay stay first he took a small cubeof iron and heated it to a great heat iam sorry i forget the degree said harrynever mind said lucy get on tothe birdand he put it into an exhausted receiversaid harrydr defaultersthe bird said lucyno my dear the cube of iron iwish i had never told you about thebirdwell well i will not be birdwittedsaid lucy papa you know told me iwas birdwitted once but harry i beg'your pardon now tell me he took asmall cube of iron and he put it into anexhausted receiveryes said harry he placed thecube of iron so that whenever he let inair it should all pass through a hole in thehot ironyou never told me of any hole in thehot iron said lucythere i was wrong said harry ishould have told you that he had made ahole through the iron cube then he letthe air into the receiver and it passedthrough and over the heated iron andwhen this receiver was filled with this airhe put a little bird into it and it breathedthe air without seeming to be in the leasthurt or showing that he felt any differencebetween it and fresh airbut the bird could not speak saidlucy and we are not sure it liked itnot sure certainly said harry butnow listen to the next experiment and youwill find what happened the man madethe same experiment with a cube of thesame size of heated brass and put thesame bird in the same receiver after it hadbeen again exhausted and filled with airwhich had passed through and over heatedbrasswell said lucy and what happenedthe bird died said harry in a fewminutespoor bird said lucy the manwas very cruel i mean the experimentwas cruelno said harry because he triedthe experiment for a good purpose to savethe lives and health of human creaturesthat was good said lucy but ithink he might have tried the experimentas well without killing the bird he shouldhave taken it out when he saw it gaspingfor breath as i am sure he did before itdied and he should have let it recoverin the fresh aircertainly said harry it was cruelas you say to kill the bird because it wasunnecessary but except that mistakewas not it a good experimentshe admitted that it was a good experimentbut she observed that the lungs ofbirds and of human creatures are differentand she thought it not quite a certain proofthat because a bird cannot live in such orsuch air that therefore it must necessarilybe unwholesome for human creatures hermother to whom she appealed thoughtthis was true and so did harry how much we have had to say andthink of from what passed today saidlucy and how many curious facts andentertaining stories we heard in conversationthough we were so vexed at beinginterrupted when the visitors first cameinyes said harry i thought of thatand thought how right my father was intelling me that we may often learn as muchfrom conversation as from booksa boating party was proposed by mrfrankland on the third and last day oftheir visit and harry and lucy were invitedto be of this party at which theymuch rejoiced they had never been inany boat this had not a sail it was tobe rowed with oars they walked downto the side of the river which ran throughthe grounds and they found the boat in alittle creek moored to a post in the banklucy thought it a little dangerous to walkover the board that was laid from the landto the edge of the boat one of the boatmenwould have taken her by the arm butas she saw harry walk on fearlessly she followedwithout assistance they were desiredto sit down as soon as they were invol ii ethe boat and something was said abouttrimming it how or why a boat was tobe trimmed lucy could not guess and shewas curious to see what would happennothing happened but that every body satstill in their places except one of themen who was to row and who stickinghis oar against the ground pushed offfrom the shore then crossing over lucy'shead with his oar and bluntly saying by your leave miss he succeeded ingetting the boat out of the little creek inwhich it had been moorednow they were fairly out in the riverand all the boatmen began to row exceptingone who sat at the end of theboat watching the way it was going andguiding it by means of the rudder or helmof which he held the great handle underhis armafter they had rowed a little way thisman made one of his companions changeplaces with another who was muchheavier and then seeming satisfied said she is well trimmed now lucy perceivedthat she meant the boat and nowunderstood that by trimmed he meantthat the weight on each side of the boatwas balancedall was new and amusing to lucy shelistened to the sound of the oars andwatched the sparkling drops hangingfrom their edges as the men lifted themfrom the water they raised them out ofthe water not edgeways but with the flatpart or blade horizontal as you wouldraise a spoonful of any liquid the useof this as harry perceived was to diminishthe resistance of the air againstthe oars as they were moved forward inorder to plunge them in the waterhis father told him that this motion iscalled feathering the oarsnow i understand said lucy thatverse in the song of the jolly young watermanwhich you used to sing papa did you not hear of a jolly young watermanwho at blacksmiths used for to ply he feather'd his oars with such skill and dexteritywinning each heart and delighting each eyee as they rowed along they saw a prettyvilla on the banks of the river lucy suddenlystarted up in the boat and askedharry if he should not like to live in thatbeautiful place with the gay verandasit still my dear said her mother for if you overturn the boat you willnever live anywhereeffectually quieted by this suggestionlucy sat down instantly and quite stillsilently enjoying the fineness of the dayand the pretty prospect of houses gardensparks and woods as they rowed on andobserving the reflection of the trees andbuildings in the clear river a bird withwhite out spread wings was skimmingover the water which lucy wanted harryto see but he close at his father's elbowwas intent on hearing what mr franklandwas saying of some foreigners whohad lately been at his house in thecourse of a tour they were makingthrough england he had taken themout boating and in going down this partof the river they had been particularlystruck not merely with the picturesquebeauty of the scenery but with the appearanceof wealth comfort cheerfulness andelegance in the residences of our englishgentry the great territories and palaces they called them of our high nobilitydid not surprise them so much as the vastnumber and variety of the lawns and pleasuregrounds and parks of our countrygentlemen one of these foreigners wasfrench the other italian in italy there arefine places and fine gardens belonging tothe nobility but none of these comfortablehabitations fit for persons in the middleranks of life the frenchman said thatthese country houses were amazingly differentfrom the comfortless chateaux infrance they had paid visits to severalof our country gentlemen and liked theirmode of living so much that even thefrenchman protested that if he had not hadthe honour of being born a parisian heshould prefer the lot of an english countrygentleman to that of any other being inthe universe the italian was furtherstruck by the liberty enjoyed and theequal justice done to all as far as he couldsee in england he found that many ofour most distinguished men have madetheir own fortunes many risen by theirown talents and exertions from the lowerranks of life he found that in this countrythough birth has great advantageseducation does more and industry andgenius have the road to fame and wealthand honours open to them he vrouldtherefore as he declared rather have beenbon in england even in a lower rankthan in the highest class in any countrywhere such equal laws and liberty andsuch strong motives for exertion are not tobe foundharry understood all this though itmight seem a little above his years andliked it the better perhaps on that accountbesides he enjoyed the praises ofdear old englandthere was in the boat a sailor who wasnow called upon to sing for them as hehad a good voice and knew many sailor ssongs and there was a boy who played onthe flute this boy was scotch and sangfor them several pretty scotch boat songsthe singing was interrupted by the manat the helm calling out rather unceremoniouslyto the boy with the flute biddinghim have done with his noise for they hadsomething else to mind now they werecoming as he said fast upon the weir andthe men who had been resting upon theiroars letting the boat float with the currentwhile they listened to the musicnow began to row across the stream whichwas carrying them forward with increasedvelocity lucy imagined there was somedanger but what it was she did not knowfor she had never seen a weir nor hadharry nor if he had known was it anytimefor talking all were silent theman who steered seemed intent on passingquickly through the current and allhands joining in the pull they reachedand brought the boat safely into a littlecreek where they moored her by throwinga rope from her round the stump of atreewhen they were all safely lodged on thebank and while the boatmen were wipingtheir foreheads harry inquired if therehad been any danger and asked what wasmeant by the weir mr frankland saidhe would show it to him soon but theycould not see it from the place where theywere standing they walked on a littleway on the shore and presently heard asound as of waters falling but still couldnot see from whence the sound came itbecame louder and louder as they advancedtill having passed the overhangingbranches of a willow which interruptedthe view they saw what caused the noiseof falling waters the stream was rushingdown a step formed by a long ridge ordam which lay obliquely across the riverthis ridge was the weir and there mighthave been some danger if the boat hadbeen carried too near it by the force ofthe currentthey were now to walk on to a placewhere they were to get into another boaton a canal as they passed along thebank opposite to the weir they had a fullview of it as the waters arching over itsrounding brim formed a length of lowwhite and greenish cascade sparkling inthe sun and by its fall indented withchanging lights and shades while lucywatched and admired these harry inquiredwhat was the use of this ridge or weirwhich he saw was not a natural step inthe bed of the river but which seemed tobe built of masonwork for some particularpurposemr frankland directed his eyes to amill on the bank and told him that theuse of this weir was to dam up the riverso as to secure a constant supply of waterand to give a fall sufficient to keep thewheel of this mill in motion harrywished exceedingly to have a nearer view ofthe waterwheel and of the mill windmillshe had seen and examined but hehad seen waterfalls only from the roadmr frankland said it would not takethem above half an hour to walk to themill and back again and was willing togrant harry's request mrs frankland didnot like to refuse him yet she seemededoubtful she looked at her watch fearingthat they should scarcely have time shesaid that she was anxious to be home ingood time for dinner because she did notlike to keep an old friend waiting howeverif the mill could be seen in half anhour there would be time she promised towait for harry and his mother said thatshe would sit down on the stump of a treeand make a sketch of the pretty situationof the mill while he went to look at itno sooner was permission granted thanharry darted off and was sure he shouldbe back again in less than half an hourbut time passes quickly when we areamused and when we are following ourown particular tastes first the greatwaterwheel was to be seen with all itsvanes and he stood observing how thewater turned it it was as the millwrightwho came out to them said an overshotwheel then it was to be explained toharry what is meant by an overshot wheeland the difference between this and anundershot wheel this was a mill forgrinding corn he had seen flour millsturned by wind and as the construction ofthe mill work was as his father told himnearly the same in this as in those whichhe had seen there was no occasion to goover it indeed he would have returneddirectly but that he wanted to look at acrane which was used for lifting up thesacks of corn from out of the boats to thegranary in the upper part of the mill andfor letting down the sacks of meal whenground harry thought he had been butafew minutes looking at this and a fewmore minutes were spent in seeing a sackdrawn up and five minutes more in examiningthe motions of a certain boltingor sifting machine the operation of whichwhen explained by the overseer particularlydelighted himthe overseer showed him that thoughthe wheat when it had passed through themill stones came out crushed or groundyet that the finer parts were mixed withthe coarse flour as well as with the branor outer coat of the grain in this state itwas first spread out on a loft in order tocool and then it was poured down througha wooden funnel or hopper y into the upperend of the bolting machine this was along hollow cylinder surrounded with asort of net work of wire resembling gauzebut of three different degrees of finenessit was fixed in a sloping direction and theoverseer having kindly stopped the motionof the machinery showed harry that withinthe cylinder there was a frame work ofbrushes attached to a small iron axis whichpassed through its whole length theoverseer by pulling a cord set this ironaxis again in motion and harry perceivedthat the flour when rapidly whisked roundby the brushes was forced out through themeshes of the wire the finest flour passingthrough the upper and closest division ofthe gauze and so on till nothing remainedbut the bran which fell out at the lowest endof the cylinder each species of flour wasreceived in separate boxes from whencethey were taken away in sacks accordingto the various uses to which they were tobe applied the finest flour being employedin making the whitest sort of breador in pastry the coarser in householdbread and the bran in a variety of domesticpurposeshighly interested with what he had seenbecause the patient overseer had made himcomprehend it thoroughly harry hastenedback to his mother and was not a littleastonished to find that they had been awayan hour instead of half an hourmrs frankland however who alwayshoped the best said that they could makeupfor lost time by walking quickly to theplace where they were again to get into aboatquick time march said mr franklandand on they marched in as quicktime as they could till they reached thecanal a long level stripe of still waterwhich as lucy said to harry looked nobetter than a broad ditch full of watershe saw many large boats on this canalloaded with coals others with goods ofvarious sorts and some crowded withpeople to her mortification they wereto go on in one of the canal boats andslowly they now went nor was there anypleasant sound of oars instead of beingby men this boat was drawn on bya horse who was fastened to it by a longrope and who walking on a path on thebank the trackway as they called ittugged on with his head down and asslowly as his feet could step lucythought he looked quite stupefied and asif he was walking in his sleepwhy do people make canals papasaid shehe explained to her that canals aremade to supply the want of rivers wherethey cease to be navigable or in placeswhere they do not naturally flow he saidthat canals are extremely useful for carryingeasily and cheaply heavy goods andnumbers of passengersharry supposed that canals could bemade only through flat countries and inground that was quite level but hisfather told him that they can be carriedthrough ground that is not leveland how do they manage saidharry when they come to hills becausewater cannot go up hill we couldnot i think go safely in a boat down hillor down steps you know we were obligedthis morning to get out before we cameto that ridge that little step in the riverthe weir yes said lucy one of the boatmensaid and my own sense showedme that it would have been very dangerousto attempt it the boat would havepitched forward and filled with waterand we should all have been drownedthen how do people manage whenthey come to uneven ground repeatedharry perhaps they do as we havedone today get out and walk till theyhave passed over the hill and then taketo the water againthat was the case formerly saidhis father and is still practised in someplaces for instance in america and evenin this country in some of the fens oflincolnshire they not only are obligedto get out of their boats harry and walkbut must carry their boats along withthem over land or over marsh from oneplace where the canal stops to anotherwhere the ground being nearly level itcan go on but this is inconvenientharry even to passengers and considerwhat it must be where heavy loads are tobe carriedvery inconvenient said harry theni suppose people take great care in thefirst place to choose the most level partsof the country for their canals and to goround the hills instead of going over them true said his father but sometimesthey cannot go round them what isto be done then harryi see nothing that can be done butto cut through them as we saw one ofthe hills we passed over in our journeywhere from the height of the banks itappeared to have been cut doom severalfeet to let the road go through the samemust be done i suppose for canals andwhere great stones or rocks come in theway these must be blown up with gunpowderas we saw men blasting away arock where they were making a newroad then the rubbish and stones andearth must be carried away and a levelbed left for the canalmust is a word easily said harryobserved his father but all this diggingand blasting and carrying away ofstones and earth is extremely tediousand expensive so much so that it wouldbe impracticable to have carried canalsacross parts of the country where theynow go if it had been necessary to makethe whole bottom or bed of the canalupon one level the difficulty is obviatedby means of an ingenious contrivancecalled a lock we shall come to oneon this canal soon and then you will seehow it is managed that we pass overinequalities of ground without beingobliged to gi out of the boat and withoutdanger of its being overset that is the best of it said lucyis it quite safe papa quite safe my dear if your eyesand your ears were shut you would notperhaps know that you were passingthrough a lockharry determined however to keep hisears and eyes well open presently theycame to two large wooden doors whichwould have stopped the way across thecanal had they been shut but they wereopen and flung quite back their boatpassed on between the doors withouttheir feeling any difference in the motionor perceiving any change in their positionthe doors were then closed behindthem and they found themselves in a sortof box or reservoir filled with waterjust large enough to hold their boat withoutstriking against the stone work oneach side or the wooden doors at eachend there were two doors opposite tothose through which they had entered these they found shut but a sluice orsliding door was immediately after theirentrance drawn up and this graduallylet off the water that was in this basinor reservoir and the surface of the watergently sunk sunk sunk down with theboat upon it with an imperceptible motionlucy could as she said only knowthat they had moved by seeing the heightabove and observing on the stone sides ofthe lock the marks of where the vaterhadbeen on their entrance the continuedthus gently sinking till they came to thelevel of the water in the canal at theother side of the gates through whichthey were now to pass when it cameto this level the men opened the gatesand the boat was drawn out and wenton without difficulty on the canal hisfather bid harry look up to the part ofthe canal where they had been beforethey entered the lock that he mightsee the height from which they hadsunknow harry said he tell me howit happened that when we first came intothe lock we found the water in it upona level with the water in the canal aboveon which we had been goingharry answered that he supposed thatbefore they had come up to the lockmen had opened the great gates and hadlet the water from the canal rush into thereservoir till it rose to a levelnot the great gates harry said hisfather the rush of the whole body ofwater from the canal would be too violentthink againharry thought again and said he supposedthere were small sluices on theside of the lock next the upper part ofthe canal similar to those next the lowerwhich he had seen opened and he supposedthat these sluices had been openedbefore they came up to the lock and hadgradually let the water inhis father told him that this was exactlywhat had happened and reminded himof a whistle which he had heard fromone of their boatmen some time beforethey came to the lock which was thesignal for the man at the sluice to openit and get ready the water for the comingboatharry was much pleased with thismost ingenious contrivance it seemedso easy he said that he thought evenhe might have invented itthis is the case with almost all goodinventions said his fatherhow nicely and gently we sunk downdoom in the boat said lucy on thelevel water in the lock while it was flowingout as my father said i am sure ifmy eyes had been shut i should not haveperceived that we were going down whata depth we sunk what a step that wouldhave been harry for a boat to comedown impossible without a lock but ifyou can go up and down stairs in canals stairs i do not know that saidharry but one step certainlyher father told lucy that he hadseen in scotland on the caledonian canalseven or eight locks immediatelyfollowing each other and the peopleof the country called these neptune'sstairsmr frankland was glad to see thatharry and lucy had been so much pleasedwith the lock as it was for the purpose ofshowing it to them that he had come homeby the canal soon after passing throughthe lock they landed by the side of a roadwhere their carriage had been appointed tomeet them mrs frankland rejoiced tosee it ready waiting for them and againshe looked at her watch as if afraid theyshould be latelate they certainly were and very late and cross and very cross was the old gentlemanwho had been kept waiting andstarving as he said an hour and a half beyondthe regular dinner time mrs franklandbore all he said and all he lookedwith such gentleness and goodhumourthat lucy wondered how he could continueangry she thought however thathe must be terribly hungry and that whendinner came and when he had satisfiedhis hunger he would grow goodhumouredagain no at dinner he grew worseand worse every thing was wrong thefish was overdone and the venison wasoverroasted and some fault he foundwith every one of the many good thingswhich mrs frankland with persuasivewords recommended try this my dear sir or try thatbut nothing he tried would do mrsfrankland looked sorry and still kindlysoothed him but at last he said somethingvery provoking about ladies neverbeing punctual and seldom thinking oftheir absent friends harry could not bearthis and his natural bashfulness quiteconquered by indignation he called out inaloud voice that is very unjust the old gentleman looked up from hisplate at harry whose face was red alloverwell done my little turkeycock said he half laughing what have youto say or to do with the businessonly that it was all my fault saidharryhe explained and said that he hadstaid too long looking at a mill and talkingabout an undershot and overshotwheelmighty well for you and your millsaid the old gentleman in a tone betweenpleasantry and reproach but prayyoung gentleman what was that you saidabout very unjust it was unjust to say that ladies neverthink of their absent friends sir repliedharry because mrs frankland who isa lady did think of her absent friends andof you in particular for she was very anxiousto get home in time lest you shouldbe kept waiting for dinner which she saidsir that you do not likewho does sir said the old gentlemannow joining in a laugh but sinceit was all your fault i must be satisfiedand must be obliged to mrs frankland forher anxiety about me this hare is verytender and not overroasted which consideringall things is wonderful mrsfrankland let us make up our quarrel bydrinking a glass of wine togethermrs frankland's good temper andsweet smile conquered him his foreheadun wrinkled and he became quite goodhumouredand talked of old neighboursand of his good old friend mr wedgwoodagain and of the staffordshirecanal the grand trunk as he called itof which the late mr wedgwood wasthe first proposer and which has enrichedso many individuals who had shares inthe original undertakingafter dinner when the ladies left theroom harry followed them for he didnot understand what was saying aboutshares in navigation and the interest paidupon them while the ladies were drinkingcoffee the conversation turned uponthe cross old gentleman and bore ratherhardly upon him one lady in companydeclaring that she thought mrs franklandhad been too kind to him that forher part she should not had she been inmrs frankland's place have thought herselfbound to submit to his rudeness or tobear his illhumour she went on to laughat him for his epicurismvol ii fbut mrs frankland stopped her shesaid that she was much attached to thisgentleman that he was an old friend ofher husband's and of his family and hadlong shown them kindness for which shefelt grateful and that the only way inwhich she could prove her gratitude wasby trying to make him comfortable andhappy in his declining years which couldnot be done without bearing with hislittle foibles his real benevolence andexcellent sense and information madeamends for them his pettishness wassoon over and his kindness of heartalways remainedlucy admired and liked mrs franklandfor speaking in this manner she resolvedthat when she grew up she wouldbe equally goodtempered and wouldbear with the foibles of old friends evenif they happened to be a little crossabove all she resolved that she wouldbe as steady as mrs frankland in defendingthem in their absencein the evening after the old gentlemanhad taken his nap and was sittingin his arm chair by the fire side hecaught hold of harry's arm as he waspassing and said to him in a gruff butgoodnatured tone tell me little man why you are socurious about mills are you to be amiller or a millwright pray or whatare you to be harry who generally understood whatwas said to him quite literally answeredgravely that he believed he was not tobe either a millwright or a miller thathe did not yet know what he was to be but whatever he was to be it could dohim no harm to get all the knowledgehe could and he wished tolearn all about mills because it entertainedhimand what do you know about themsaid the gentleman can you tell mewhat keeps a mill goingwind keeps a windmill going repliedharry and water a waterfallthere are other kinds of mills whichfarekept going by horses and some aremoved by men and many by steamupon my word you know a vastdeal said the gentlemanno sir i know very little saidharry bluntly and looking ashamed andnot well pleasedwell i will not affront you any moreby flattering you since i find you do notlike it said the old gentleman comeadded he drawing harry towards himwe shall be good friends yet you willsee i saw you playing with my grandsonat marbles yesterday do you knowhow marbles are made no sir said harry taking one outof his pocket and looking at it i shouldlike to know how they are made so veryround and smooth i should think it mustbe difficultit is my friend mr wedgwood toldme that he had found it one of the mostdifficult things he had ever attemptedand when i was on the continent i inquiredhow they were made and how are they made sir saidharry first they cut a certain sort of stoneinto bits of any irregular shapes nomatter what nearly the size of a commonmarble these they throw into an ironmill in which there is a number of partitionsand to each partition strong raspsare fixed in a slanting direction the mill isworked by water and is turned with greatswiftness the rubbing of the stonesagainst the rough rasps and against eachother rounds them and by degrees smoothsand polishes them in the same manner asthe gravel becomes rounded in the bed ofa river when they are formed to the propershape they fall through circular holesmade in the bottom of the mill of the rightsize to let them through from nurembergthe town where they are made theyare brought down the river rhine to rotterdamand thence sent all over europe to allcountries and places where boys play atmarbles and where do they not and nowyou know more about marbles than ninein ten of the hundreds of boys of your agewho have their pockets filled with themthe backgammon table was now setfor the old gentleman usually played agame with mrs frankland about thistime every evening but instead of goingto it he staid talking to harry and tellinghim of various things which he hadseen when he was in holland when first i went to amsterdamsaid he i remember as i approachedthe city counting fortysix windmills allin motion the dutch have long beenfamous millwrights and many of the contrivancesnow in common use in our millsin england were brought from holland for instance one which you may have seenin your journey here did you take noticethat on some windmills there is a verysmall sort of fan wheel which stands outa little from the top yes i know what you mean sirsaid harryso do i said lucy when firsti saw it i thought it was a little windmillto frighten away birds from the cornand do you now know the use of it i do said harry for my fathershowed me one and explained it to me the use of that little wheel is to turn thegreat sailwheel towards the wind bymeans of the wind itself so that whicheverway it blows the mill continues to workin those which have not this ingeniouscontrivance the mill must stand stillevery time the wind changes and themiller cannot set it in motion again withouta great deal of trouble he must haulround the whole top of the mill in anawkward waywhy how said lucy doharry explain the two ways in which thesedifferent windmills turn or are turnedi have some idea but still i forget exactlyhow it isoh i am sure you know saidharryperhaps i did know but go on asif i did not begin from the beginningfirst if you please with the awkward waywith that windmill which has no littlefanwheelthat common mill said harry iscalled a post windmill because it is supportedupon a post which is fixed firmlyat bottom and which goes up throughthe middle of the inside of the woodenbody or towerpart of the mill thistower is separate from the mason workand from the grinding wheels underneath it hangs on the top of the post and canbe turned round upon it this way do you mean like thissaid lucy holding her pencil upright andhanging her thimble on its pointsomething like it said harry butthe great sailwheel is fastened to thewooden tower and one cannot be movedround horizontally without turning themboth suppose the wind changes fromnorth to south then the tower itself must beturned so as to bring the front of thesails to the side opposite to that onwhich they had stoodhow inconvenient and how does themiller do this for that tower and thesails and all must be a great weightsaid lucyhe could not do it without thehelp of a lever said harry there isa huofe ladder which is fastened to theupper part of the tower and whichreaches from that to the ground slopingoutwards so as to be a prop and stayto keep the mill fixed in the position inwhich it is to stand with the sails facingthe wind but the wind changes andthe mill must turn then the miller liftsup from the ground the lower end of thisgreat ladder which he then uses as a longhandle or lever by which he turns roundthe mill till the sails are again properlyplaced so much for the post windmill nowfor the other said lucy that withthe little fzin wheel as you call itf that does the business cleverly andwithout any trouble to miller or manonly the top not the whole body of thiskind of windmill is moveable the axisof the great sail wheel goes through thismoveable top and therefore can be shiftedround horizontally along with it this toprests on rollers so that it can move easilyon the top of the solid stone wall of thetower now for the little wheelaye the little ingenious wheel saidlucythat is so placed at first that itsvanes catch the wind whenever it does notblow upon the sails of the great wheelso as soon as great wheel stops little wheelsets agoing and it sets in motion a trainof wheel work all which i need not describeto you i need only say that ithas the power gradually to turn the moveabletop round till it brings great wheelwith its sails facing the wind then greatwheel sets agoing and little wheel bythis time having worked away from thewind stops its business is done andit rests till it is wanted when thewind again changes so as to blow on itsvanes then it sets off again and worksthe great wheel round to the right pointand so on continuallyvery well you understand it i seesaid the old gentleman if i may say thatmuch without your thinking that i meanto flatter youharry smiled but said he there isa thing i do not at all understand aboutwindmills i saw some standing stillwhile others nearly in the same situationwere going with the same wind i wasthinking what the reason of this could beand i suppose that there must be somethingdifferent in the way in which thevanes or sails themselves are sloped or set believe i should call it you think rightly i believe said theold gentleman i have a friend in francea scientific man who made a windmillwhich continued working when all theother windmills in the neighbourhoodremained motionless the common peopleused to gather round and stare atit and say that it went by enchantmentfor they could not conceive how it couldofo with less wind than their own butthis arose from the judicious position ofthe vanes which had been placed so thatthe wind should act upon them with thegreatest possible forcei wish i knew that judicious positionsaid harry i have often tried to discoverit in making little windmills but icould only place the sails by guess ishould like to know the rule and the reasonand the best possible wayand i should be very glad if i couldtell you all this my dear but that is beyondme learned men have thought andwritten much upon this very question buti am not a man of science or a mathematiciantherefore i cannot explain it to youi can describe only the things which ihave seen and which i understandhe then gave harry an account of severalthings he had seen in amsterdamharry knew that this city is built uponpiles lucy said lie recollected readingthe number of these piles which wasprodigiousharry asked whether any of them hadgiven way or whether the houses stoodupright upon themno said the old gentlemanthefirst idea i had when i entered amsterdamwas that many of the houses were tumblingdown they were so much out of the perpendicularline but still they do notfallharry was going to ask the reason ofthis but another question occurred to hismind which he was afraid he should forgetif he did not ask it first pray sirsaid he do you know if the dutch areacquainted with the use of steam enginesoh yes certainlythen why said harry do not theyuse steam instead of wind to keep theirmills at workwhy should they said the old gentleman because said harrv wind is uncertainthey cannot have it when theyplease and if they have not wind theirmills must stand still if there is astorm they cannot make the wind less ormore just as they want more or less forceor quickness but we can manage steam aswe please at all times of the year and inall weathervery true my little mechanic saidthe gentleman the dutch are now beginningto use steam engines and what ismore what more he said lucy was in nocondition at this moment to hear for onthe scattering of the snuff which he threwfrom his fingers she was seized with a fitof sneezing that seemed as if it wouldnever end when she recovered she heardthe old gentleman speaking of the embankmentsor high and broad banks which thedutch have been obliged to raise to protectthe country from inundations these embankmentsare secured chiefly by matsfastened downy willows which are twistedtogether and which remain after theillmats decay and thus form the best barrieragainst the force of the seawillows said she such yieldingthings which i can bend with the leasttouch can they withstand the whole forceof the sea yes exactly for that reason said theold gentleman because they do not resistjust as you may have seen the mostyielding manner do best against the torrentof anger and the gentlest of women subduethe most violenttempered menlucy smiled she was always ready forasimile but she liked this extremely andwas pleased with its particular applicationharry's heart now opened he drew closeto the elbow of the arm chair from whichhe had before kept at a certain distanceand he began to use his privilege of askingquestions freely which he had till nowdone only with great reserve his mothersoon called him away and advised him andlucy to go to bed as they were to set offearly the next morning to pursue theirjourney they were sorry to go and everybodyseemed sorry that they were goingthe old gentleman asked which road theyintended to take and when harry's fatheranswered by coalbrook dale he said thathe was very glad of that for the sake ofhis young friendsperhaps i shall not be up when you setoff in the morning said he so shakehands young gentleman and fare you wellit is happy for you that so early in lifeyou have acquired such a desire for knowledgetomorrow you will see mr frankland interrupted him mydear sir do not tell him what he will seeleave him the pleasure of surprisegoodbye it was come to that melancholyword and as lucy put her head outof the carriage window to say the lastgoodbye to mr and mrs frankland whowere on the steps at the halldoor shuttersopened in a bedchamber above the sashwas thrown up and the old gentleman putout his head and repeated goodbyegoodbye and a good journey to you thank you thank you sir and prayshut the window or you will catch coldsaid lucy he was very kind to youharry after all continued she as theydrove away and told you a great manyentertaining and useful things and at lasti liked him very well though he did takeso much snuff and though he was a littlecrass yesterday at dinner he made up forit afterwards i do believe harry that heloves mrs frankland in his heartwho can help it said harryi wish said lucy that when i growup i may be such a womani wish you may said harry in a tonethat sounded gruff because it was as muchas he could do to command his voice tospeak at all he was so sorry to part withthese kind friends lucy indulged him inhis taciturnity and began to examine alittle red morocco memorandum bookwhich mrs frankland had put into herhand at parting and which she had heldtill now unopened on turning over theleaves of this book she found some of thepages filled with close writingdear good mrs frankland exclaimedlucy look mamma she haswritten all this for us with her own hand and what do you think it is the juvenile gardener's calendardedicated to harry and lucy by their sincefriend e frankland spring summer autumn winterall in four little pages said lucyi am always puzzled with the long directionsin gardening books about heaps ofthings too which i have not but here i seeare only such flowers and plants as we haveor ought to have in our gardens anyand continued she after looking over thecalendar it tells me exactly all iwanted to know about the times and seasonsfor planting and transplanting andsowing seeds and how to have successionsof pretty flowers i must read it to youany she read and when she hadfinished he joined in her delight at findingthat it contained all and no more thanthey wantedand you read it much better lucythan you sometimes read writing saidharrybecause said lucy this is muchplainer than writing is sometimes do yourecollect harry how i stumbled in tryingto read to mamma your translationyes i knew you wanted to read itparticularly well said harry but youboggled terribly it made me very hotnot hotter than i was said lucy iwanted to read it particularly well indeedthat was the very reason you couldnot said harry you were too anxiousand frightened but what frightened me was that icould not make out the writing i knew iwas making nonsense of what i was readingand i could not help it since youhave set up to write a running hand likepapa's you run all your letters into one anotherso that at last in some of yourwords there is not a single plain letterah my dear i can show you in thatvery translation several possibly but then you make threekinds of rs and when i have learned toknow one of them then comes the otherquite different and all your ws and nsand us and vs are so alike no humancreature in a hurry can tell them asunder and you never cross your s so how can itell them from s but i do dot my fs said harryyes you do but you never put thedots over the right letter i can never guessto what heads the hats belong and thenworse than all you half scratch out andhalf write over and half turn one letterinto another and then repent and leave itno letter at all but all this i could bearif you did not make vulgar flourishesoh lucy be just i have left offflourishing you must acknowledge eversince you told me it was vulgar i havenever flourished since that daybut that day was only last tuesdaysaid lucy i do not know whether it wa tuesdayor wednesday replied harry but iknow it was the day you read or could notread my writing to mamma and i havenever flourished sincepoor harry i beg your pardon forreading your translation so badly saidlucy the next i well read better if ican the next i will write better if i cansaid harry let me look again howdoes mrs frankland make her writing soplain and so pretty too said lucy ttlooks pretty because it is so even andstraight audit ig distinct because letme see she always makes the same lettersthe same way that is one good thing for then i know them aoain when i meetwith them and she leaves a little spacebetween her words so that we may seethey are separate words and she finisheseach letter and does not make her ms andais so very much alike that people cannottell the difference the little es too are alittle different from the zsvery little said harry if i hidethe other letters i defy you mrs lucy totell even mrs frankland's i from her ebut look at the difference harry theeis a little open at top or at worst iknow the i by the dot over it lookthe hat is always on the right head and iknow the head by the hata woman's way indeed of knowing ahead said harry laughingoh harry when you come to laughingat women said lucy i know youhave nothing else to sayyes i have replied harry sinceyou are so fond of reading mrs frankland'swriting here is a little bit more foryou here is a page in your book whichyou have not readlucy took the book but was disappointedwhen she saw this page was only a catalogueof the botanical names of the flowersand shrubs mentioned in the juvenilegardener's calendar she did not knowthe use she said of calling flowers andshrubs by latin names when they havegoodenough english names by which allpeople may know them if they please sheconfessed that the only thing she had notliked in all that mrs frankland ever did orsaid was her having that day in the gardenalways told the latin names of theflowers after the english harry i know you think as i do thatyou thought so at the time that mademe dislike it the more because i was afraidyou would think it was you know whati know said harry and i did notlike it i ownwe will ask mamma said lucythey had been all this time talking toone another on their own side of the carriageand their father and mother on theirswere conversing on something perhaps asinteresting to themselves it was necessaryto wait for a pause at the firstwhich occurred the case was laid beforethem lucy stating it with some hesitationand ending by sayingam i wrong father to think it waspedantic am i wrong mamma to sayany thing about it not at all wrong to speak your opinionfreely to us my dear said her motheryou would be foolish said her fatherif you blamed without inquiring whetheryou were right or wrong but you wouldbe wrong if you spoke to any stranger of afault that you saw or thought you saw inthose who had been kind to youyou do not think it was pedantic thenmammano my dear i do not but before wecan understand one another we must settlewhat we mean by pedantic what do youmean lucy said she knew what she meant butshe could not exactly describe it sheturned to harry first he said that it wastalking greek or latin in the wrong place he added that it was trying to show thatwe had any sort of learning that other peoplehad not but this lucy thought wasrather vanity or ostentation than pedantrythey had heard people call things pedanticwhich they did not think were so for instance a boy had once said that harryhimself was a pedant for talking of thesiege of syracuse and of the machines usedthere because the boy knew nothing aboutthem and disliked readingthen you perceive said his motherthat the meaning of the word varies withthe different degrees of knowledge of thosewho use it i remember when it wasthought pedantic for a woman to talk ofsome books which are now the subject ofcommon conversation sometimes oldfashionedlearning and sometimes uselesslearning is called pedantry and it isgenerally thought pedantic to produce anykind of learning that is so unusual that itis not likely that the company is acquaintedwith it or can be pleased by itin short pedantry may be said to be anilltimed parade of knowledgevol ji gto go back to mrs frankland mammas'said lucy she knew that we werenot acquainted with those latin namesyes but she did not consider you ascompany she did not display her knowledgeto excite your admiration she usedthose names in speaking to you becauseshe thought it might be useful to you tolearn them the knowledge of the botanicalnames of plants is not now unusual most people we meet with are acquaintedwith themi did not know that said lucy andnow i recollect mamma when mrs franklandwas talking of plants to the artificialflowerwoman who did not seem to knowany thing about the matter she called themonly by their common english names therefore i am sure she told the latinnames to us because as you say shethought it would be of use to us if shehad wanted to be admired for her learningshe would have displayed it in companyso it is proved harry that she was notpedantic and i am very glad of itbut still said harry who did not seemquite satisfied remember what mammasaid that useless learning is pedantrythen the question is whether this beuseless learning or not said hisfatherthat is the very bottom of the questionto which i want to get said harrywhat is the use of knowing all those longlatin names when people may know theplants they are talking of as well bytheir own english names they may know them and describethem as well to english people but not toforeigners said his father most welleducated foreigners french spaniardsgermans italians danes or swedes understandlatin therefore it is a sort of universallanguage in which botanists andpersons of science can make themselvesunderstood by each other in all books ofbotany the latin is given along with thecommon name and then the description ofthe plant to which this name refers can beapplied by people in different countriesgi have a friend at paris who could not understandwhat was meant by a cowslip becausein french there is no distinguishingname for cowslip it goes under thegeneral word for primroses primeverej yet a cowslip and a primrose are verydifferent said lucybut said her father if this frenchlady had been acquainted with the botanicname she would have known the differencethe moment it was mentioned and the deficiencyin the french vocabulary wouldhave been rectified i remember hearinga french lady talking to a gentlemanabout the beautiful laurier rose thegentleman understood french but he happenednever to have seen a laurier rosein france therefore he could not understandwhat she meant she described itbut still he mistook it for a rhododendron at last somebody mentioned its botanicname nerium oleander and the momentthe gentleman heard this latin name heunderstood what was meant and he knewit was the common oleander which he hadoften seen in english greenhousesharry now understood the use of learningthe latin botanic names and he wassatisfiedremember my dear harry addedhis mother that i mean no more thanthat it is useful as a lanouaoe and as ameans of acquiring knowledgelucy said that she would learn by heartall the botanic names of the commonflowers in the garden calendar whichmrs frankland had been so kind as towrite in her pocketbook and she beggedharry to tell her whether many of themhad any particular meaning like those twowhich she had been told hindrance thewater lover or acanthus the beautifulbecause she thought she could then learnthem more quickly by heart and rememberthem betterharry said that he would if he couldbut that he would rather do it at anothertime he wanted to look at a broadwheeledwaggon which was coming downthe hill and while he watched the shapeand motion of the wheels and asked hisfather some questions concerning themlucy was pitying the poor dog whowas chained underneath the waggon andwho as he waddled along apparentlyhalf dragged by the neck looked verymournful she was told that his use wasto guard the waggon and that his beingchained to it secured his always being nearit she wished very much that the mancould be persuaded to loose him a faithfuldog she thought would guard his master'sgoods without being chained her motherobserved that it would be useless to talksentiment to an english waggoner lucywished that she had some money that shemight give it to buy this dog from his masterand set him free her mother toldher that even supposing she could buy thisdog the man would get another and thisdog would not perhaps be better ois as henight not find anybody to feed him youknow my dear lucy we could not takehim with us what should we do for thenext dog we meet under the next waggonlucy saw the impossibility of freeingthem all and sighed her mother was gladto see that she had such humane feelingsfor animals but said there is much wemust bear to see in this life that we cannotremedy all we can do is to take as goodcare as possible of those creatures of whichwe have the chargelucy blushed i will take care not toforget to give poor dash water when i havehim again mamma i recollect one day here she was interrupted by harry exclaiming father pray look out of thewindow this instant do you see thatstreak of black powder in the track of thewaggon papa i saw it dribbling from abarrel is it not gunpowder may i getout and lookhe spoke as fast as he could utter thewords and his father instantly called tothe waggoner stopped the carriage andjumped out harry following him it wasgunpowder they ran after the waggonerwho either did not hear or would not stopwhen they overtook him and showed himthe gunpowder running out of the barrelhe being a sulky fellow was very angrywith the barrel and with the man whopacked it and with the man to whomit was going and with every body buthimself he had no clear idea of thedanger he had run till harry's father toldhim that he had some years before knowna waggon to have been blown to pieces andmen and horses killed by just such an accidentsome gunpowder had been shakenout of a barrel in the waggon and hadtaken fire as it is supposed from a sparkstruck from a flint in the road this communicatingwith the gunpowder had blownup the whole the waggoner scarcelycredited the story till he heard the nameof the hill down which the waggon hadbeen going and then as harry observedwithout any further question he believedit to be true so it is that ignorant peoplebelieve or disbelieve without any reasonablegrounds they staid to see thebarrel well packed and safely stowedsome of the passengers who were sittingwithin the canvas roof of the waggon andwho had looked out and listened now expressedmuch gratitude and said theymioht have lost their lives but for thistimely discovery of danger the waggonerthen grew warmer in his thanks and as hewas repacking the barrel said in his tone to harry master you've done uz a mortal goodturn i finds and if zo be it was in my powerto give you a lift any ways fd not bebehind you'd zee but the likes of i cando little for the likes of you gem'menharry thanked him he wanted nothinghe said but he was glad that he and hiswaggon were safe how well it was father said harryas they walked back together to the carriage that i saw the gunpowder runninggoutand recollected what you had told meabout the blowing up of the waggonyes said his father you see howuseful it is to observe what passes beforeyour eyes and to recollect what you knowat the right timewhen lucy heard what had passedafter rejoicing that waggon and waggonerwere safe she regretted that when the manoffered to do harry a good turn he had notsaid a word for the dogi forgot the dog cried harry fatherwill you stay for me three minutesi will run and speak for the doghis father smiled and back he ranwhat he said or in what words the waggonerreplied we cannot tell for harrynever could remember either the words heused or those said to him but the resultwas as he informed lucy that the doglion was unchained that the waggonerpromised that lion should have liberty torun after him by day and that he shouldbe chained only by nightlucy was proud of her brother's share ofthis affair and as was ever her custom whenshe was happy she went on talking ofevery thing she could think of and of allthat she saw upon the road while harryaccording to his custom when he was wellpleased with himself and particularly happywas quite silent after lucy had exhaustedevery thing she could say sheperceived harry's silencewhat are you thinking of harry areyou still thinking of lion and the waggonersaid she not i for there is nothing more to bedone about them said harry i am consideringwhat that very bright thing can bewhich i see out yonder sparkling in thesunshinei see it said lucy it looks like amonstrous diamond twinkling betweenthe trees what is it papa look atither father thought it was the reflectionof light from some weathercock or polishedglobe on the top of a building as theyapproached nearer they saw it was fromthe glass roof of a conservatoryreflection of light said lucy whatdo you mean papa by the reflection oflight and what is the difference betweenreflection and refraction of which i haveheardher father answered when the raysof light are thrown back from the surfaceof any polished substance on which theystrike for instance from a polished pieceof metal or of glass they are said to bereflected when the rays pass through anytransparent body and in doing so areturned from their direct course they aresaid to be refracted and this light is calledinfracted lightdo you recollect lucy said harryyesterday in the boat you observed thatthe oar in the water looked as if it wasbroken that was because you saw itthrough the water mr frankland toldyou that was the effect of refractioni remember said lucy that he toldme so and that i did not understand at thetime what he meant i was ashamed to askhim more about it and afterwards i forgotit but you harry can explain it to mecannot youindeed i cannot said harrybut papa will you be so good as tomake us understand itmy dear i cannot be so good as tomake you understand it yet till you havemore knowledge i am glad howeverlucy that you observed the appearance ofthe oar in the water and that you wish toknow the reason of what you saw seeminglyslight observations of this sort lead toimportant discoveriesdo they indeed papa said lucyyes but often observations such asthese though they might lead to great discoveriesif pursued remain hundreds ofyears useless because people do not try tofind out the reason of what they have seenas long ago as the time of aristotlewhich is above two thousand years amongother questions in his works on naturalhistory he asks why a stick appearsbent when it is held obliquely in waterthis question was never rightly answeredtill about four hundred years afterwards byptolemy the fame of several great philosophersamong the moderns rests upontheir discoveries of the rules or laws formeasuring that refraction of light on whichthe appearance of the bent stick in waterdepends and not till the time of ourgreat newton was the whole satisfactorilyexplained or all the knowledge obtainedto which it has led he by pursuing thisand other seemingly slight observationsand by trying experiments carefully to findout the cause of what he had observed madehis great discoveries of those propertiesand laws of liorht which we call the lawsof reflection and refraction even fromconsidering the colours on a soap bubblewhich many others had observed beforehim but of which they had made no usehe was led to some of the most importantconclusions respecting vision and coloursbut here all philosophical conversationceased interrupted by the sound of the hornof a mail coach harry and lucy quicklydarted their heads out of the window for though oftentimes seen lucy neverwillingly missed the passing of a coachstage or mail this was as harry guessedthe royal mail with its guard behind thescarlet man with the gold laced hat blowingthe authoritative trumpet to clear theroad proud as a king on his thronesat the manycaped manycravatted coachmanon his box with his four fine horseseven in hand who kept on in full trotregardless of the load behind the whipidle in the master's hand except that oncehe flung out the long lash with a lighttouch to remind one careless horse that hemust draw fairly and to bring him intotrue trotting time as they passed lucyadmired the horses much but the harnessmorenice said she and nicer than anygentleman's harness bright brass ringsstanding upon the horses foreheads withtwinkling mammals glittering in the sunregardless of the harness and the twinklingmammals harry had eyes only for thehorseswhat fine creatures and how theygo oh father look how they turn thecorner cried harry leaning out of thecarriage to watch them till they were quiteout of sightthe road for the rest of this stage wasas lucy observed a stupid straight lineshe could find nothing to do but to countthe carriages they met in the last fivemiles her father told her that on thebath road he had once met eleven stagecoaches in five miles but on this roadshe met in five miles only one heavyladen waggon and twelve coal cartsharry wondered that she continued stilllooking out of the window when therewas nothing to be seen but coal carts she said she had a reason for this andhe left her to take her own time to tellit which did not happen this stageharry do you remember that theold gentleman told us last nioht saidlucy that we should be surprised beforethis day's journey should be overso he did said harry but i havebeen so happy all day that i neverthought of it till this minute i have been very happy too saidlucy but i have thought of it sometimesand now that dinner is over andthat evening is coming on it is time tothink about it i wonder harry what itcan belucy was standing in the parlour ofthe inn where they had dined and shelooked all round the room and then outof the window as she spokethere is nothing surprising here iam sure said she but i heard papaorder that the horses should not be putto yet not for two hours what can bethereason of that harrywe are to walk through some parknear this town i believe said harryand the carriage is to meet us at thefarthest gate and we are to see somehouse come come lucy papa iscalling to us to follow himlucy followed with great alacrity certainthat they were now going to be surprisedbut they walked up an avenueof beech trees and reached the housewithout meeting with any thing surprisingand lucy was disappointed whenshe found that her father and mothercame to this house only to look at somepictures neither harry nor lucy hadyet any taste for pictures and their mothertherefore advised them to divertthemselves by running about the pleasuregrounds which amusement theywere permitted to enjoy upon her answeringfor them that they would not touchany of the flowers or shrubs first theywent through all the flower gardens thenthrough the park and by the river side andup again through a wood on the banks tillthe red light of sunset which they saw onthe stems of the trees warned them to returnfrom whence they came they were afraidof being too late and of keeping their fatherand mother waiting but luckily they metthe woodranger going home from hiswork and he showed them a path whichtook them the shortest way to the houseinstead of being too late they found thatthey need not have run so fast for theirfather and mother had not yet finishedlooking at the pictures let us sit down then and cool ourselvesquietly said lucy harry onlythink of papa and mamma having been allthis long time looking at pictures howtired i should have been if i had beenstanding all this while with my neck bentback staring up at them harry do youthink that when we grow up and set outupon our travels that we shall ever be sofond of pictures as to stand looking atthem so long perhaps we may said harrythough we do not care about them nowi remember some time ago i neverthought of looking at prints except ofmachines but ever since the day i sawthe prints in don quixote i have grownfond of themyes and how happy we were togethersaid lucy looking over the printsin pine's microcosmtrue i forgot them said harry ialways liked those because they are solike things and people we see everydayand the prints in the arabian talessaid lucy though they are not likethings we see every day or any day orthat we can ever see in reality you likethose do not you harry i do said harry some of themsome of them repeated lucy veryright so do i those that are like my ideasof what the sultans and viziers and fatimaand their turbans and come hassanmight be but some others i do notlike such as aladdin's genius of the lampand the african magician because they donot come up to my imagination of themharry do describe to me your image ofthe african magicianit was a difficult task and harry wasglad to be relieved from it by his father'scalling to him to desire he would see ifthe carriage was come to the parkgateit was there waiting and by the time theygot into it the sun was set and it wasgrowing dusk by the time that theyreached the end of the next stage and haddrank tea it was quite dark they werehowever to go on another stage this nightlucy who did not much like travellingin the dark observed as her mother wasgetting into the carriage that the coachlamps were not lighted never mind my dear said her father we shall have light enough soonsoon oh no papa begging yourpardon cried lucy there drill be nomoonlight these two hours i can showyou when the moon will rise by my newpocketbook papavery likely my dear said her father but lucy do not stand talking on thestep of the carriageat the moment when her father wasgiving her this advice one of the horseswas startled by a light and giving a suddenjerk to the carriage lucy was thrownfrom the step backward and must havefallen under the wheel but that her fathercaught her in his arms and set herupright again into the carriage shewent directly and while yet tremblingwith the fright her father repeated hisadvicewhile you live child never againstand in that manner on the step of a carriagewithout holding by something iassure you that you put yourself into muchgreater danger at that moment than anyyou are likely to meet with from the darknessof this nightlucy hoped that her father did not thinkthat she was a coward and after some minutes'silent submission she expressed thishope and began to defend her character forcourage by reminding harry of all the instancesshe could recollect of her neverhaving been afraid in a carriage harrysaid nothing i cannot see your faceharry i hope you are agreeing withmeno i am laughing for i think you arealittle afraid at this minute i feel yousqueezing close to me because we aregoing down the hillthink and talk then of somethingelse said her mother and do not telllucy she is a coward or you will make herone lucy my dear there is no danger but if there were ever so much you cannotalter it no mamma only i wish he wouldnot go quite so fast said lucy wouldyou speak to him no t cannot teach the postillion todrive can you lucy no indeed mamma said lucylaughing or trying to laugh then we had better let him follow hisown business which he understands andwhich we do notvery well mamma i know you areright and that there is no danger nowwe are down the hill i feel and it is allovernicely but mamma suppose therewas danger and that the horses werereally what is called running away whatwould you do sit still the only thing whichwould not increase my danger answeredher mother could not you get out mamma saidlucyi could perhaps but i would not attemptit because know it is the most hazardousthing that could be done said hermotheryes said lucy's father i believethat more lives have been lost and morelimbs broken by persons attempting to getout of carriages when horses were runningthan ever were lost by overturnsall who have had experience can tell youthat the best thing you can do is to stayquietly in the carriage till the horses stopor are stopped if you make any noise orscream or call to the person who is drivingyou endanger yourself more because youdistract his attention and you may be surethat he is doing the best he can becausehe is probably as fond of his life asyou are of yours and as to driving probablyhis best is better than your bestcertainly papa but if said lucyand there she paused if whati am not sure whether it is right tosay it papa but i have heard that coachmenand postillions are sometimes drunkvol ii hand if he was drunk he would not knowhow to driveand do you think that his beingdrunk would make you know how todrive said her fatherlucy laughed again because harrylaughedbut papa i should know better thanhe did if he had lost all sense true but i would not advise you asalittle girl or even if you were a womani should not advise you to attempt to director argue with a drunken man forbesides the danger of his giving some rudeanswer either the coachman would betoo drunk to understand any thing or hewould not as long as he could understandany thing it is probable he wouldunderstand what he habitually knows besthow to drive if he be so far intoxicatedas not to know how to do that he would bestill less able to comprehend your reasons ordirections supposing them to be ever sogoodavery true said lucy she declaredthat she never should think of talking to adrunken coachman or postillion but shehoped that she never should be driven byonein which hope her mother joined herlucy my dear said she vrhen i viasyoung i was afraid in a carriage and i willtell you how i was curedhow mamma i was cured of my fear for myself bya greater fear for another person i usedto be sent out airing with a lady who hadlost the use of her limbs and i was somuch afraid for her that it took my attentionaway from myself she was verycowardly i was taken up in quieting herapprehensions and i saw that nine timesin ten when she was alarmed there was nocause for fear this encouraged me thenext time and so on besides the feelingthat if there were any danger i must actfor her was a motive to me to keep mysenses and presence of mindh as to that last said lucy i thinkat least i fear that it would have had acontrary effect upon me and that i shouldhave been ten times more afraid with thehelpless person in the carriageno said harry i think i shouldhave felt as my mother did what stops us what is the mattersaid lucymatter nothing in the world mydear said harry laughing only wearestopping till the turnpike gate is openedand till this old man with a lantern hasfumbled the key into the locklucy joined in his laugh and said afterwards laughing is very good forcuring people of being afraid foolishly forwhen you laugh harry i know that thereis no danger or you could not be somerry and now it is very extraordinary but i am no more afraid than youare harry i will prove it to you i willthink of any thing you please i can capverses with you if you will no thank you not yet i do not knowenough to cap with you yet my dear thelittle that i know is from shakspeare andthat is blank verse which will not do forcappingbut it will do for repeating saidlucy and i wish you would repeat someof the quarrel of brutus and cassias whichwe read togetheri will try said harry where shalli beginbegin said lucy with brutus'sspeechwhat shall one of usthat struck the foremost man of all this worldbut for supporting robbers shall we nowcontaminate our fingers with base bribes harry repeated this as if he liked it andwent on through all brutus's part of thequarrel he said he could not forget anyof this because he felt it he admiredbrutus and lucy pitied cassius his motherobserved that he liked dramatic poetrybetter than descriptive lucy howeverthought some descriptive poetry was beautifuland repeated to him the description ofqueen mab and her chariot of the hazelnutmade by the joiner squirrel timeout of mind the fairies coachman thisharry liked well also some of the fairiesin the midsummer night's dreamwho light their tapers at the fieryglowworms eyes and harry admiredariel in the tempest whose businessit is to tread the ooze of the salt deep to run upon the sharp wind of the north to dive into the fire or ride on the curled cloudsor put a girdle round the earth in forty minutesand he could conceive delicate ariel'spleasure in killing the canker in the rosebudsflying on the bat's back or lying in acowslip's bell but for pope's elegant arieland the fifty chosen nymphs of specialnote he cared but little he well knewthat his mother admired them but he wastoo sturdily honest to affect admiration whichhe did not feel he thought it was his faulthis mother told him that perhaps he wouldlike them hereafter and that in the meanwhilehe need not despair of his own tastefor poetryharry observed how much more easy hefound it to learn lines which he understoodthan to get by heart lists of nameshe said that he recollected having read inbaron trenck's life that when the king ofprussia wanted to try trenck's memory hegave him to learn by rote a list of fiftystrange names of soldiers in a regimenttrenck learned them quicklyi am glad said harry that i wasnot in his place for his majesty wouldhave thought me quite a dunce and wouldhave decided that i had no memory it ismuch more difficult to learn nonsense thansense continued harry there is somethingin sense to help one outunless it be droll nonsense saidlucy but when it is droll the diversionhelps me to rememberharry doubted even thistheir father said he would if they likedit try the experiment by repeating forthem some sentences of droll nonsensewhich were put together by mr foote ahumorous writer for the purpose of tryingthe memory of a man who boasted thathe could learn any thing by rote on oncehearing it oh do let us hear it cried lucy and try uslet us hear it said harry buti am sure i shall not be able to learnitit will be no great loss if you do notsaid his fathernow lucy pray sit still and listensaid harrybut harry's power of attention whichhe had prepared himself to exert to theutmost was set completely at defiancewhen his father as fast as he could utterthe words repeated the following nonsenseabruptly beginning with so she went into the garden to cut a cabbageleaf to make an apple pie and at the same time agreat shebear coming up the street pops its headinto the shop what no soap so he died andshe very imprudently married the barber and therewere present the picninnies and the joblillies andthe garyulies and the grand panjandrum himselfwith the little round button at top and they allfell to playing the game of catch as catch cantill the gunpowder ran out at the heels of theirbootsgunpowder at the heels of their boots horrible nonsense cried harry whilelucy rolling with laughter and laughingthe more at harry's indignation onlywished it was not dark that she might seehis facewell can either of you remember orrepeat any of this said their motherlucy said that if it had not been forthe grand panjandrum she was almost sureshe should have been able to say it butshe was so much surprised by meeting thegrand panjandrum himself again and sodiverted by his little round button at topthat she could think of nothing else sides laughing hindered her from hearingthe names of all the company who werepresent at the barber's marriage but sheperfectly well remembered the picking and she knew why she did becausetheir name was something like piccanini and this word had been fixed in her headby a droll anecdote she had heard of anegro boy who when he was to tell hismaster that mr gosling had called uponhim one morning and could not recollecthis name said he knew the gentleman wasa mr goosepiccanii so you see lucy said her fatherthat even with you who seem to be yourselfone of the numerous family of the piccannesor of the goosepiccaninies there isalways some connection of ideas or soundswhich helps to fix even nonsense in thememory papa will you be so very good as torepeat it once more now harry oncemore let us tryi would rather learn a greek verbsaid harry there is some sense in thatpapa could you repeat one i could son but i will not now saidhis father let your sister divert herselfwith the grand panjandrum and do notbe too grand yourself harry it is sweetto talk nonsense in season always sensewould make jack a dull boythe grand panjandrum was repeatedonce more and this time harry did hisbest and remembered what she went intothe garden to cut for an apple pie andhe mastered the great shebear and theno soap but for want of knowing whodied he never got cleverly to the marriagewith the barber but lucy less troubledconcerning the nominative case went onmerrily and she very impatiently marriedthe barber but just as lucy wastriumphantly naming the company presentfuture commentators will observe that this alslules to the ancient british adageall work and no play makes jack a dull boyall play and no work makes jack a mere toyand had got to the joblillies harry whoseattention was not so wholly absorbed asto have no eves for outward nature exclaimedfather father look look outof this window a fire a fire a terriblefire it must be the whole sky yonderred with itterrible said lucy looking outit must be a town on firefather repeated harry much astonishedby his father's silence and composure do not you see it do said his father but it is not atown on fire you will see what it is presentlya dead silence ensued and the grandpanjandrum was forgotten as though hehad never existed they drove on harrystretching out of one window and lucyleaning out of the other while her motherheld her fast lest the door shouldopenharry what do you see i see firesflames great sparks flying up againstthe sky now i see i do see mammaa house burning there there mammaat a distance flames coming out at thetop on my side i see flames coming outof the ground said harrylucy rushed tumbling over to her brother'sside of the carriage bidding him lookoutat her house burning fires indeed the whole country is onfire said lucy i suppose they are burning the grassor a wood said harry endeavouring toregain his wonted composure and to makesense of it but certainly there is a houseon fire father flames red as blood burstingfrom the top and we are coming nearer and nearerevery instant cried lucy the road i seeis going through the middle of these fires oh father mother will you call to theman he must be going wronghe is going quite right my dear saidher mother keep yourself quiet there isno danger as you may see by our notbeing alarmed for you or for ourselvesthese words calmly pronounced tranquillizedlucy and harry determined towait the event and not utter another wordwhatever he might see he was quitecertain by his father's composure thatthere was no danger either for themselvesor for other people but this security lefthis mind more at liberty to feel curiosityand very curious he was to know what wascoming how it would end and above allhow it would be accounted forthey were driving now along a raisedroad with fires on each side of themflames seemed to burst from the ground atintervals of a few yards their deepred colour and pointed shape appearedagainst the dark night far and wide as theeye could reach the fires near the roadmade it as light as daymy father might well say we shouldhave light enough thought harryi wonder the horses are not frightenedby the fires thought lucy she had beenfor some time breathing short in dreadevery instant that the horses would startoff the raised road and overturn thecarriage or plunge and throw the manorset off full gallop when none ofthese things came to pass and whenshe saw the postillion so inconceivablyat his ease as to lean over and pat hishorses and then to take off his hat andtighten the band and try it again andagain on his head till it fitted lucy beganto breathe more freely and she observedhow plainly they could see the man andhorses and the black shadow of the carriageupon the roadthen exerting herself to find somethingto say to show she was not afraid shelooked for the burning tower but it wasconcealed by a turn in the road or it wasconfounded with other distant flamesit is like the country of the fireworshippersin the arabian tales said she and there they are pointing to a groupof figures she saw by one of the fires nearestthe road figures with pale faces likespectres the light shining strongly on themshe could see the man's bare arms andhis shovel as he shovelled up the burningmass and the boy standing byand the woman with the child in herarms quite like a picture i have seensomewherebut never anywhere said harrydid you see such a real sight as thisall those lone fires for miles roundbumino how or for what i cannot it is like the infernal regions is notit harry said lucyi never saw them said harry norany thing like this it is very wonderfulwhat can the fires be for signal fires no thought harry there are too manyand on flat groundsignal fires are always on hills arenot they father i see these fires near usare from little heaps or hillocks of earth but whether they were artificial or naturalmade by men's hands or thrown upby subterranean fires harry could notdivine he wished to find out he desirednot to be told and yet he almost despairedof discovering father i have read in some book oftravels of fires that burst out of the groundof themselves and i have heard ofsome lake of pitch or some what do youcall it bitumen do you meanthe very thing i wanted father arethese fires of that sort from bitumen ordothey burst out of the ground of themselvesnot exactly either said his fatherbut those are both good guessesthe fiery tower again brother criedlucy they came near enough to it nowto see its dark form and even to hear theroaring of the fire the body of flame undiminisheddiminishing kept spoutingup from the top of the black tower blownto and fro by the wind nobody near orheeding it when the road brought themto the other side of the tower they saw anopen red arch underneath which seemedto be filled with a sloping bed of fireharry had often seen a limekiln burningin the night it is a lime kiln i dobelieve only of a different shape from whati have seenno said his father but that is asensible guessthen it is a founder i have it nowi remember the picture in the encyclopaediait is a founder for melting iron or brassnow i begin to understand it alland there are others of the same sortsaid lucy coming in view and whatis that black shadowy form moving upand down regularly and continually likethe outline of a steam engine like the great beam it is a steamengine cried harry i see othersthere they are going on all night longworking working working always doingtheir duty by themselves and of themselves how very sublime said lucyhis father told harry that he was quiteright in supposing that these were foundersas to the fires he said most ofthem were low ridges of coal which wereburning into coke for the use of the forgesthe process was very simple after thecoals were set on fire a man was employedto cover them with ashes throughwhich the smoke could escape till theywere sufficiently burned coke he toldthem gave out a more steady and intenseheat after the gas and smoke were drivenoff some of the fires he added mightperhaps proceed from the refuse smallcoal which were known occasionally to ignitespontaneously and were suffered toburn as there w as no danger of their doingany mischief in this waste landwhen this explanation was given lucy'sinterest a little diminished with the mystery but harrv s increased when lie consideredthe wonderful reality i shall like to see this country by daylightsaid harry and to learn whatthose numbers of steam engines are doinofthat must be for tomorrow said hisfatherwhen they visited the fiers moor bv daylightthey saw only a black dreamt wastewith half burning half smothering heaps ofdross coal and cinders clouds of smokeof all colours white yellow and blackfrom the chimneys of founders and forcesdarkening the air the prospect they couldnot see for there was none it was a deadflat the atmosphere laden with the smell ofcoal and smoke the rass the heroesthe trees all blackened the hands andfaces of expiry man woman and child theymet begrimed with soot the very sheepblackened not a lamb even with a lock ofwhite wool or a clean face lucy saidthat it was the most frightful country shehad ever beheld harry acknowledgedthat there was nothing beautiful here to beseen but it was wonderful it was a sort ofsublime he could not help feeling a greatrespect for the place where steam enginesseemed to abound and in truth to have theworld almost to themselves these labouredcontinually in vast and variousworks blowing the huge bellows of thefurnaces of smelting houses forges andfounders raising tune of water each minuteto drain the depths of the coal minesthe strokes of the beams of the steam engineswere heard at regular intervals andthe sound of the blast of the furnaces at adistance as they approached the foundersthe noises grew louder and louder tillas they entered the buildings the roaring ofthe draft was tremendous lucy involuntarilyholding her breath looked up to herfather she saw his lips move but she couldnot hear what he said she held fast byhis hand and stood still she saw an immensefurnace full as she thought of liquidfire but it was redhot liquid metal oneman with brawny arms bare up to theshoulders and a face shining with perspirationwas carrying this fiery liquid in alarge ladle another poured it out intomoulds of sand some men with whitecaps on their heads and pale firelightedvisages were hurrying to and fro carryingin longhandled tongs masses of redhotmetal others seen in the forge at a distancewere dragging out redhot barswhile two were standing with huge hammersraised waiting the moment to givetheir alternate blows lucy tried to makeharry understand that she thought themen were like cyclops but she could notmake him hear the words in this placeit seemed in vain for human creatures toattempt to make use of their voices herewind and fire the hammer the bellows themachinery seemed to engross the privilegeof being heard the men went onwith their business in silence only makingsigns when they wanted you to stand outof the waywhile they were seeing the founderthey were met by mr watson the masterof the works to whom harry's father hada letter of introduction he apologizedfor not having been able to attend themhimself but now he said he was atleisure for some hours he hospitablyinvited them to his house which was at alittle distance there he introduced themto his wife and sisters lucy and hermother staid with these ladies while mrwatson took harry and his father to seehis colliery they were one by one to belet down in a bucket into the shaft of thecoal mine which was like a deep wellmr watson turning his eyes upon harryasked his father if the boy would be afraidto go down harry colouring highlyanswered for himself no sir i am notafraid to go wherever my father goeshis father went down first with one ofthe colliers in the bucket it was let downby the rope from a steam engine in a fewseconds harry lost sight of him and soonthe bucket reappeared with only the collierin itnow you may go down or not just asyou will said mr watsoni will go down said harrythen do not be in a hurry let meput you into the buckethe took him by the arm and lifted himin and the collier bid him be quite stilland he was so the bucket was let downand it grew darker and darker as they descendedtill at last he could see only a littlespeck at the opening at top like a star oflipht he could but just distinguish themans hand and arm like a shadow as hepushed against the sides of the shaft to keepthe bucket from striking they landed safelyat the bottom where there was lamplightand harry sprung out of the bucketwith the assistance of his father's handand he was very glad that he had had thecourage to go down as soon as mr watsonhad descended and joined themhe took them through the galleries andpassages of the coal mines and showedharry where and how the men were atwork harry was surprised to see thenumbers of workmen and of carriages thatwere conveying the coal and here hehad the pleasure of seeing what he hadlong wished for the manner in which asteam engine was employed in pumpingout the water that collects in a mine beforesteam engines had been brought intogeneral use the master told him that itwas the labour of years to do what is nowperhaps done in a few dayshis father stopped to look at a kindof lamp which has been used for sometimein lighting mines and which fromits peculiar construction is called thesafety lamp as it completely preventsthe fatal accidents that formerly occurredfrom the explosion of inflammable vapourswhen ignited by the unprotected flameof a candle harry wished to understandit but his father told him he wouldvol ii iexplain it to him at another opportunitythat they must not delay now for mr watson'stime was precious which mr watsondid not deny however he did nothurry them he only spoke shortly passedon quickly and called to the man at thewindlass to let down they weredrawn up in the same manner by whichthey had descended and harry was gladto see the daylight again though it dazzledhim and to feel the fresh air next theysaw the iron rail roads on which smallcarts loaded with coal were easily pushedalong by one man sometimes by one childguiding or following them and presentlythey came to what mr watson calledthe inclined plane harry saw tworoads of railway placed beside each otherup and down a steep slope on one of themthere were several empty coal carts linkedtogether and on the other a cart loadedwith coal which as it ran down the slopedragged the empty carts up this was effectedby means of a chain which was fastenedby one end to the loaded cart andby the other to the empty carts and whichpassed round a large pulley at tee top of theslope or inclined plane so that the loadedcart descending by its own weight on oneroad made those on the other road ascend little man you may take a ride upand down if you will said mr watson safe enough and i see you are no flincherand not bred too daintily to sit in a coalcart a slave to a coat or a jacketharry jumped upon one of the emptycarts throw him a truss of that hay tosit on there hold fast now for your lifekeep an eye on him up with youand up he went and from the toplooked down upon his father and for amoment he felt afraid to go back again itlooked so steep a collier's boy who wasstanding by grinning told him he went upand down the same way ever so many timesa day and no harm never harry said tohimself if it does not hurt others whyshould it hurt me and thus conqueringhis fear by his reason he took his seatand down he went father cried harry as soon as hei had one leg out of the cart i am gladlucy was not with us she would havebeen frightened out of her wits at seeingme coming downlook to yourself now and take yourother leg out of the cart said mr watsonfor we want the cart to go up againit was lucky i drew my leg out of theway in time or i should have been thrownout of the cart along with that mountain ofcoal said harryyes people must take care of theirown legs and arms in these places saidmr watson and in all places it is nobad thing to dobluff and rough as he was harryliked mr watson who was very goodnaturedand whenever he had time tothink of the boy pointed out what wasworth his seeing but once nearly threwhim into a ditch by swinging him too farwith one arm over a stile at the nextstile harry said i would rather get over by myselfsir if you pleasedo so if you can and i see that youcan so i need not trouble myself moreabout youit was dinner time when they reachedmr watson's house here they dined atan earlier hour than harry and lucy wereused to but they were quite ready to eatharry especially after all the exercise hehad taken the dinner was plentifulthough plain and there were creams andsweet things in abundance for the masterloved them and his wife and sisters wereskilled in confectionary arts as soon asthe cloth was removed mr watson swalloweda glass of wine and pushing thebottle to his guests rose from table sayingi must leave you now to take care ofyourselves i must go to my businessharry jumped up directly and followedhim to the door his mother called himback saying she was afraid he would betroublesome mr watson did not ask youto go with him did he i did not think of the boy saidmr watson looking back from the door i am going only to see my workmen paidthis saturday evening this would be nodiversion to you my boy would ityes it would said harry if i shouldnot be troublesome he was going to saybut mr watson went onfollow then and welcome you willnot be any trouble to me i shall not thinkof you more than if you were not withmeso much the better thought harry wholiked to stand by and see and hear withoutany body's minding him mr watsonhastily swinging round his great coat as hespoke flung the flaps into harry's eyesbut harry not minding that ran after him mr watson strode across the court yard andup the office stairs three steps at a timethe room was full of men who made waydirectly for their master but the crowdclosed again before harry could passhowever he squeezed in under the elbowsof the great men till he got to a cornerbeside the desk of the clerk who was sittingwith a great open book and a bag ofmoney before him harry knew he wasnot to interrupt so he asked no questionsbut got up on a tall mushroomtopped leatherstool which stood beside the clerksseat and watched all that went on hewas amused with the countenances of themen who each in turn came to the deskhe observed that mr watson was in thefirst place very exact to see that they wererightly paid once when there was somedifficulty with a deaf stupid old manabout the balance of his account helooked into the books himself to see whetherthe old man or the clerk was right and harry looking and listening tried tolearn what was meant by this balance ofaccount mr watson was better than hisword for he found time between the goingaway of one class of workmen and thecoming of another to explain it to harrywhom he saw poring over the clerk'sshoulder and who once ventured to sawwhere is the balance that he is talkingaflook here the whole mystery is thislook at the top of these pages and of allthe pages in the book d and c thatis debtor and creditor debtor on theleft hand page creditor on the righthand page all that this man owes to meis put on the debtor or left hand side ofthe book all that is due to him is to beput on the creditor or right hand sidethen add together all the sums that belongto the debtor side and all the sumsthat belong to the creditor side and seewhich is the heaviest or largest and deductthe least or lightest sum from it thedifference whatever it may be is calledthe balance you may consider an accountas a pair of scales and the suratput on either side as weights thetwo sides are at last to be made tobalance each other as the weights in theopposite scales now for example lookhere at john smith's account debtorside two pounds creditor side fourpounds eight shillings you my boy maymake out what the balance is which iam to pay him write your answer downwhen you know it but take your headout of my way i must go on with mybusinessharry wrote his answer with a penciland put it on the desk before mr watsonbut it was long before it was seen orthought oftwo pounds eight shillings is the balancedue to john smithright said mr watson the samemethod is observed in keeping all accounts the money paid by the person who keepsthe account is put on the debtor side andthe money received by him on the creditorsideis that all said harry all in simple accounts said mr watsonbut bookkeeping though on the sameprinciple is much more complicatedharry was interested in listening to whatwas said to the people mr watson inquiredhow they were going on at homeand they told him all about their wantsand their hopes and their fearsseveral of the workmen left part oftheir money in his hands to be put intothe savings bank harry understoodi that by so doing the men obtained a provisionfor the time when they might besick or must grow old there was oneslovenly man in rags illpatched whenhe came up to be paid mr watsonlooked displeased and said what ashame giles to see you in such ragswhen you earn so much if you wouldput less of your money into your cupyou would have more on your backharry understood what he meant theragged man walked away ashamed whilehis companions laughed at him mr watsonwas steady as well as goodnaturedto the people the industrious and frugalhe encouraged the idle and drunken hereproved and he took pains to see thatjustice was done to them allwhile harry had been seeing theseworkmen paid and learning what ismeant by the balance of an accountlucy had been learning somethingequally interesting to her concerningsugar plums and sugarcandy one ofmr watson's sisters was well informedboth in the practice and theory of confectionaryas soon as harry came inlucy ran to him to tell him what shewas intent upon and he was obligedfor the present to keep his debtor andcreditor accounts to himself harry my dear you know thoselittle tiny sugarplums which are nolarger than the head of a minnikin pin i think i know the sugarplums youmean said harry but i do not knowa minnikin pin nor the size of its headthen never mind said lucy iforgot that you being a man could notknow minnikin pins as well as i do butas to the sugarplums you saw some thisvery day at dinner on the top of the trifle i remember said harry well well my dear harry you can haveno idea what hard work it is to makethose little comfits miss watson wastelling me how she made qinofer swear and afterwards i asked her if she couldtell me or show me how those littlesugarplums are made she said thatshe could not show me for that shecould not make them herself not beingable to bear the heat in which theymust be made she told me that thepan in which they are boiled must besetover a great fire and that the sugarof which they are made must be stirredcontinually in that heat a man with alonghandled shovel keeps stirring stirringstirring and sometimes strong menfaint in doing thisharry wondered that some way of stirringthe sugar in these pans by machineryjiad not been contrived and he was goingto question lucy farther upon thesubject but she was in a great hurry togo on to sugar candy harry do you know how sugarcandyis made i will tell you for ihave just learned when sugar is dissolvedit is poured into pots acrosswhich sometimes thin rods and sometimesthreads at a little distance fromeach other are stretched these mouldsand the liquid sugar in them must allbe covered up and kept in a greatheat for a certain time and nobody mustdisturb them they are placed in aroom which is one great stove care istaken that no wind should be admittedfor they say that the least disturbancespoils the whole and prevents the sugarfrom forming into those regularshapedcrystals which you have seen in sugarcandyif the vessels are not disturbedthey form on the little rods i mentionedto you or on the strings i dare say youremember often finding strings in sugarcandy and now we understand the use ofthem but what do you mean by crystalssaid harry will you explaini remember i once thought saidlucy that crystals meant only bits ofthat white substance which looks likeglass but miss watson has explainedto me that there are crystals of varioussorts and substances of sugar for instanceand sugarcandy and of i do not knowhow many kinds of salts in short of allsubstances that can be crystallised thosewere her words as well as i can remembervery likely said harry but stilli do not know exactly what is meant bywhat you call crystallisingturning into crystals said lucywhat more would you have here iswhat they call a crystal of sugarcandyhere are its regular sides crystals youknow have always regular sides and aregular number of them look at it andtouch it and taste it if you willharry looked and touched and tasted but still not quite satisfied he said iwant to know what difference there isin things before and after what you callcrystallisationthe difference in this tji'mg is veryplain said lucy before it was crystallisedit was syrup that is sugar andwater and now you see it has becomesolid very well so far i understand saidharry but how or why do fluids crystalliselucy did not know she confessed andwas well satisfied to let the matter restthere for the present some time afterwardsshe took notice of an ornament onthe chimneypiece a small basket whichlooked as if it were composed of crystalsof glass or of white sparmiss watson told her that it was notmade either of glass or spar i madeit said sheyou made it how could you makeit said lucy and of what is itmade it looks something like whitesugar candy perhaps it is made in thesame way perhaps it is a sort of sugarcandy the taste would soon decide thatsaid harry may i just try the experimentwith the tip of my tonguemiss watson gave him leave to tasteit but she warned him that he might perhapsnot like the taste then i guess what it is said harryafter having applied the tip of his tongueto one of the crystals he added by thetaste i am sure it is alumit was alum lucy had seen largepieces of alum but none large enoughto be hollowed out into a basket of sucha size and it would have been difficultto have carved it into such regular shapesshe recurred to her first idea of the resemblanceto sugarcandy and she continuedto think that it was made by the samemeans miss watson told her that shewas so far right in her guess that it wasmade in the same manner as sugarcandythat is by crystallisation she showedher the whole process which is very simplein the first place she put somewater into an earthen pipkin with as muchalum as could be dissolved in that quantityof water she boiled it till the alumwas dissolved by these means she toldlucy that she had obtained a saturatedsolution of alum that is that as much ofthe alum had been dissolved as the watercould hold then miss watson took alittle wicker basket and suspended itby its handle on a stick laid across themouth of the pipkin so that the baskethandle and all were totally immersed inthe dissolved alum the basket did nottouch the bottom of the pipkin as it wasvery light it would not have sunk in thewater had not a little weight been putinto it the whole was then covered witha coarse cotton cloth and put aside in acool place where it was not likely to bedisturbed she advised lucy to let italone during a day and night to givetime for the crystallisation to go on slowlyso as to form perfect crystals which canbe obtained only by the slow and regularevaporation of the waterthere still seemed to be some difficultyin lucy's mind after she had heard thisand looking at harry she saidi know what you are thinking ofharry and i am thinking of the samething that i wish i knew exactly whatis meant by crxjstallisationr that was what i was thinking of saidharry and i was wishing that i couldget at a book which we have at home inwhich i know that there is an explanationof itmiss watson asked if the book wasconversations on chemistrythe very book how quickly youguessed it and you have it how verylucky said lucy as miss watson tookthe book from her bookcase she foundfor harry the passage that he wanted itbegins with emily's saying i do not quite understand the meaningof the word crifstall'isatlon t that is exactly what i felt saidharry and what i ought to have felt saidlucy but i really did not know thati did not understand it till you asked meto explain it harry now let us readonafter readings a few lines she came toconversations on chemistry vol i p eighth editionthe word caloric and asked if caloricmeant the same as heatnot exactly miss watson said inthis book the difference is definedshe turned to another part of the bookand showed lucy the passage vhieh drfinesthe difference between heat and caloric the subject was new to lucyand almost at every lineije wanted explanationsshe stopped and whispered toharry that she was not sure she knewwhat was meant by the integral arts ofa body miss watson turned to the beginningsof the volume and showed her aperfect clear explanation of integralparts fhow well you know all this i saidlucy you know where to find everythingin this bookmiss watson said that was not surprisingfor that she had read it more thanonceconversations on chemistry vol i p eighth editiont ibid p the first time you read it did you findit difficult said lucyno she said she had not found it difficultbut very easy and clearah because you did not read it tillyou were grown up i suppose said lucymiss watson said that she did not thinkthis was the reason as she had seen readersnot older than lucy understand it perfectlywellit is very odd then said lucythat i am obliged to stop you see twoor three times before i have read a singlepage to ask the meaning of the wordsbecause you have begun in themiddle you have not read the book fromthe beginning said miss watson orelse you would have found all the termsexplained as you went onbut even so i am afraid i shouldhave forgotten them said lucy sighingyou must have a very good memory toremember them allmiss watson said that besides havingread the book from the beginning she hadoften looked back to the definitions of thewords and to the explanations whenevershe found herself not clear as to what wasmeantthe conversation afterwards turned upondifferent subjects in which lucy had noconcern therefore she followed harrywho took the conversations on chemistryto a comfortable nook in the room wherehe could be quiet and after his slow butsure manner he made himself understandthoroughly what he was reading lucyread more quickly and when her motherand miss watson were passing by themshe caught hold of the skirt of her mother'sgown and saidi understand this passage about crystallisationnow mamma i think it is veryclear i do not in the least doubt that itis very clear my dear said her motherbut are you very clear here mamma if you will just look atthe book at this passage mamma whichbegins crystallisation is simply i do not want to read it my dear'said her mother or to hear you read itbit tell me the sense of it in your ownwordsbut mamma though i do understandits said lucy you know it is impossiblethat i could put it in such good words i am well aware of that lucy saidher mother but explain it in any wordsthat will express what you mean thenyou will be certain of what you know ordonot knowwell mamma in the first place supposea body that is a substance what kind of a body what kind ofa substance said her mother it must be a fluid said lucy yesmamma before it can be crystallised itmust be a fluid therefore begin by supposinga fluid no i believe that first ofall before it becomes fluid the body shouldbe a solid hey harry which shall itell mamma to suppose a fluid or asolidsettle it for yourself lucy my dearsaid her mother it cannot depend uponwhat harry thinks but upon what really isthe facti recollect it all now mamma saidlucy after a short pause and i will beginagain with a solid body mamma supposea solid body sugar for instance oralum mamma is dissolved either byheat or by water and suppose that noneof its original parts that is the parts ofwhich it was originally composed arelost by being dissolved but only separatedas it were by the water or by theheat by which they are dissolved thenmamma if you could again take away theheat or the water the original parts of thesubstance the alum for instance wouldcome together again and adhere whenwhat separated them is gone this iscrystallisation you may take away theheat by cooling it and then the first partscome together again in a solid form oryou may evaporate the water which separatedthe parts by heat and then theywill come together again crystallisedwhatever way you do it whether by heator cold if it is not disturbed but allowedto go into its regular forms it is calledcrystallisation you have laboured through your explanationlucy tolerably well said hermotherbut there is one other thing more youshould say lucy said harry say it for me said lucy that different substances form intocrystals of different shapes crystals ofsubstances of different sorts as i have justbeen learning continued harry havealways a certain regular number of sides so that when you see the crystal aftercounting the sides you can tell of whatit is composed or you can tell beforehandthe number of sides and the shape ofthe crystals that will be formed from anyknown salt or substance which you havedissolved and left to crystallisefor instance alum cried lucy thealum which was dissolved in the hot waterand which miss watson has left there tocrystallise we know will be in the sameshaped crystals as these in this firstbasket i will count and tell you thenumber of sidesharry said he thought that miss watsoncould if she pleased tell the number ofsides without counting them and so shedid how difficult it must be said lucyto get by heart and to keep in the memorythe number of sides which belong toall the different kinds of crystals you need not do that said misswatson lists of them are to be foundin many books to which you can referwhen you want thembut you knew alum without lookingat any book said lucyyes because i had been accustomedto see its crystals said miss watsonas i told you before many of the factsin chemistry or mineralogy which it wouldbe difficult to remember separately ormerely from having read or heard an acvolii kcount of them are easily fixed in themind by trying experiments and by connectingthose facts with othersmiss watson told lucy that she had becomeparticularly fond of this study becauseher father was a chemist and shehad often been in his laboratory while hewas at work unless i had seen theactual things i should not have rememberedthe descriptions of them i am suresaid she and besides i was so muchinterested in my father's experiments andso curious to know whether they wouldturn out as he had previously expectedthat the whole was fixed in my memoryunless i had had somebody with whosepursuits i could sympathise and in whosediscoveries i felt an interest i shouldsoon have forgotten even the little i hadlearned but does not it make you happylucy askedare you or are you not happier thanif you had not this pursuit said harrymiss watson smiled at the earnestnesswith which they questioned her and answeredthat she thought she was muchhappier for having this taste and this occupationshe said it never prevented herfrom doing other things which were morenecessary to this her brother added histestimonyher beinsr something of a chemist hasnot spoiled her hand for being a good confectionersaid he on the contrary ithas improved it for she knows the reasonsfor what she is doing all confectionersand cooks must be chemists for so muchbut they do not know the reasons whythey succeed one time and fail anotherwith them it is all knack and haphazardor what we call iwactke at best nowcontinued mr watson here is an oldreceipt book which belonged to the greatgrandmotherof a noble family famous inher day no doubt for her cakes and puddingsand confectionaries and curesfor all manner of sprains and aches andk bruises look at any of these and you willsee what nonsense half of them are howmany useless ingredients are put into thereceipt either on purpose to puzzle otherpeople or from ignorance and a sort of superstitiousbelief that there was a viistoyin doing these thingsharry and lucy amused themselves bylooking at some of these old receiptswhich however were hard to decipherthe ink being yellow and the spelling oldand incorrectthe next day was sunday harry andlucy went with their father and motherand mr watson and his family to churchthe church was in the village near thehouse as they were walking home mrwatson asked if they would like to seesome of the houses in the village wherehis workmen lived and the cottages in theneighbourhood harry and lucy wereglad to take this walk and harry keptclose to mr watson wherever he wentin one cottage the master of the housea great fat man was sitting at his dinnerhot roasted duck and cauliflowers were onthe table before him while his wife apale starvedlooking soul was standingbehind his chair waiting upon him andhis children were huddled together in acorner at a distance he never let anyof them eat with him he laid down hisknife and fork as the company came intrying as much as he could to soften hissulky look mr watson spoke kindly to hiswife and children but took no notice ofthe man as he went out of the house hesaid loud enough for him to hear i should have no appetite for my roastduck if i were forced to eat it by myselfwithout my good wife to take a sharelucy wondered that mr watson did notinsist upon the husband's letting the wifeand the poor children sit down with himbut mr watson replied that he had noright to do this every man had liberty todo as he pleased in his own house and inhis own affairs he could not interferebetween man and wife farther than he haddone by laughing at the surly husbandand shaming him before company hesaid he had known this man buy for hisown eating the first green peas of the seasonwhen they were expensive rarities even when his children had not clothes tocover themthe selfish creature said lucy the brute said harryin the evening as they were walking in apretty lane near mr watson's house theymet a man who was endeavouring to comeup the lane but he could not by anyefforts he could make walk in a straightline he was so much intoxicated that hescarcely knew what he was doing whenhe met mr watson he started stammeredtried to take ojqfhis hat and to stand out ofthe way but he could not accomplish itlucy was very much shocked mr watsoncalled at his clerk's house and orderedthat this man john giles should be struckois the list of workmen and should not beadmitted to the founder for the nextweek and that markham who was a soberfellow should come m his placeharry thought this was very right tillsome time afterwards when the drunkenman's wife came to mr watson to beg himto pardon her husband and to readmit himto the work she said that if he did notshe and her children must suffer for itthat her husband would beat her and onlydrink the more if he was vexed thetears rolled down her face as she finishedspeaking harry wondered how mr watsoncould refuse her for it was not herfault that her husband was drunkenat night when harry was in his father'sroom he talked to him about thisand asked whether he thought mr watsonwas right or wrong right his fathersaid he did not think his refusal was hardheartedbut steady because it was hisduty to do what was just for a great numberof people as well as for this one manif he were to employ a drunken workmanin preference to a sober man this wouldencourage the drunken and be unjust to thesober i would not encourage the drunkenand idle upon any account said harryi thought mr watson was quite right atfirst in ordering that he should not be admittedto the works for a week butmight not mr watson have forgiven himfor the sake of the woman then any other workman might drinkand might hope that his wife would beghim off and obtain his pardon saidharry's fatherfather said harry after a long silenceand looking very serious i thoughtthat a great mechanic was only a personwho invented machines and kept themgoing to earn money and to make thingscheaply but now i perceive that there isa great deal more to be done and if ever igrow up to be a man and have to manageany great works i hope i shall be as goodto my workmen as mr watson is i willbe as just and steady too if lean butfather i see it is not so very easy to bejust as i should have thought it wasthere is a great deal to be considered asi find from all you say about forgiving ornot forgiving the drunken man for hiswife's sake i feel that i have much morethan i knew of before to learn harry i wish you would go to bedand to sleep said his mother for i amsure you must be tired after all you haveseen and heard and thought this daynot in the least mother i never waswider awake said harry howeveri will go to bed to please youour travellers were to set out beforebreakfast and very early in the morningthe family promised that they would notget up to see them off lest they should delaythem on their journey lucy did notforget to inquire for the alum basket whenshe wished miss watson good night andgoodbyeif it has succeeded you will see it inkthe hall as you pass through in the morningsaid miss watson but yesterdayone of the servants shook the vessel containingit and by that means preventedthe crystals from forming rightly i wasforced to begin the whole operation againthis time i locked the door to secure itsbeing undisturbedas soon as she was dressed in the morninglucy ran down to the hall to see whetherthe basket was there and there itwas standing beside her bonnet thewicker skeleton was no longer visible every part of it handle and all beingcovered with crystals of alum apparentlyperfectly formed she did not howeverstay to examine exactly or to count theirsides which is always a tedious business but seeing a note directed to herself tiedto the handle she tore it open immediatelyit told her that this basket was hers if sheliked itif to be sure i do said shemiss watson suggested that if lucyshould ever attempt to make such a oneshe might put into the solution of alum alittle gamboge which would give to thecrystals a pretty yellow tint or she mightmix with it any other colour she preferredwithin the basket nicely placed lucyfound several little paper cornucopiasfilled with sugarplums and rose andlemon and barberry drops with receiptsfor making each written within thepapers in which they were containedshe was so much delighted with hercornucopias and their sweet contentsand with the pretty crystallised alumbasket and with the goodnatured makerand giver of these good things that shecould think of nothing else during thefirst hour of the morning's journeynow mamma will you taste the barberrydrops excellent are not they andthe lemon better still oh mamma cannotyou taste any more here are sevenother kindsbefore breakfast it was impossible totaste all the seven even to oblige lucyand in honour of miss watson butharry was an indefatigable taster hewent on without resistance but withoutgiving what lucy deemed sufficient tributeof praise to each at last whenmuch urged by the repetition of is notit excellent harryhe confessed that the tastes of differentdrops were now all so mixed in hismouth that he could not tell one fromthe other lucy shut up her cornucopiasand reserved her plenty for time of needbut mamma said she when allthese are gone now that i have thereceipts i can make the same whenever ipleaseit is not quite certain her mothersaid that because you have the receiptsyou can make others equally good wheneveryou pleasepiqued a little by this observation andby a smile of harry's lucy began to formvarious schemes of trying experiments inmaking rose and barberry drops andsweetmeats like those which she hadtasted of miss watson's and which everybodyhad liked she enumerated suchnumbers of things which she intended tomake that harry at last laughed andsaidmy dear you will then turn cook andconfectioner quite and forget every thingelseher mother observed that it was usefulto know how these things should be done but that the propriety of making or notmaking them ourselves depends upon thecircumstances in which we are placedand on our rank of life those who haveservants that can make them would actfoolishly in wasting on such work their owntime which they may employ more advandangerously miss watson who perhapshad no servants that could make thesethings did wisely and kindly in makingthem herself for her friends who likethem and it was particularly obligingand amiable of her to condescend to doso because she has other pursuits and acultivated understanding lucy's mothertold her that if she persevered in her wishto learn how these things were made sheshould at the proper season of the yearsee and assist the housekeeper in makingsweetmeats this satisfied her and shewas at leisure to listen to harry whofor his part was anxious to become achemist and who had been struck withthe idea of the happiness of the personwho possessed a laboratory and could trychemical experiments his father toldhim that it was not necessary to have alaboratory and a great apparatus for thispurpose as one of the most ingeniousand successful of chemists and philosophershas observed many most usefuland excellent experiments can be triedin an easy and simple mannerhere his father was interrupted by anexclamation from lucy at the sight of atall finger post on one of the arms ofwhich she observed to birminghamharry and lucy anxiously watched tosee whether the driver turned down thisroad as they had both an ardent desire togo to birmingham to see some of the manufacturesof which they had heard mostinteresting accounts lucy's astonishmenthad been excited by some scissors whichmr frankland had shoti her which shehad tried and which though not of themost beautiful polish cut sufficiently wellfor all common purposes and yet oh wonderful mr frankland told her that thispair was one of a dozen which he hadbought for one shilling harry's curiosity had been raised byhearing of a knife with five hundred bladeswhich he had been told was to be seen atbirminghamthe knife came first to his recollectionan instant afterwards however he saidbut there are things there a thousandtimes better worth seeing than that oh father cried he turning to hisfather i hope we shall go to birminghamthat we may see the grand worksat soho mr bolton's i read an accountof them while we were at mrfrankland's in one of the notes to thatbotanic garden when you were lookingfor the bartering vase lucy it saidthat there is a magnificent apparatus forcoining all worked by one steam enginewhich cuts halfpence out of sheets ofcopper and at one stroke stamps both thefaces and edge of the moneyyes i remember your reading it tomesaid lucy and it was said thatfour boys of ten or twelve years old nobigger mamma than harry could by thehelp of this machinery worked by thatgreat giant enchanter the steam enginemake how many guineas do you thinkin one hour thirty thousand mammawas not it harry yes thirty thousand repeatedharry and besides this it is saidthat the machine keeps an exact accountan unerring account was the veryword said lucy it keeps an unerringaccount of all the money it coins papai do hope you are going to birminghamoh mamma i hope we shall see all thatwas described in those lines do you recollect i hope we may see hard dies of steel the cupreous circles crampand with quick fall the massy hammers stampher father told her that he believedthat these massy hammers are no longerat work at soho but that a far more magnificentapparatus for coining is nowestablished at the mint in london hehoped he said to show them all thesewonders of mechanism of which they hadread in prose and poetry at some futuretime for the present however he mustdisappoint them he could not go tobirmingham he must pursue the roadto bristol even on their account headded addressing himself to their motherhe did not choose now to go tobirmingham the general principles ofa few great inventions he hoped hadbeen clearly understood and fixed in theirminds by what they had already seenhe was glad to find that they had takenpleasure in following the history of theprogress and consequences of those noblediscoveries he would therefore take carenot to confuse their minds by showingthem the details of small ingeniouscontrivances in the birmingham workshopsand manufactories or by dazzlingtheir eyes with the sight of morethan arabian tale magnificence in theshow rooms of the great toyshop ofeuropeharry and lucy had not been so muchspoiled by their father's and mother's indulgencethat they could not bear disappointmentone sigh lucy was heardto give for the great toyshop of europeharry suppressed his rising sigh for sincethe steam engine coiner was not to be seenhe cared little for the rest they bothagreed that papa knew bestand this was not with them a merephrase said with a look of hypocrisy butwith honest faces and hearts and firmbelief from experience of the truth ofwhat they saidwhat is the name of the town to whichwe are to come next mamma said lucybridgenorth my dearbridgenorth repeated lucy i amsure there is something i have heard aboutbridgenorth but i cannot remember whatit isi know what it is i believe saidharry a famous leaning tower yes said lucy that is the verything i recollect reading about it inmy history of england which said thatthis tower of bridgenorth was not alwaysleaning formerly a great while ago itwas upright and like any other tower butit was shaken from the foundation whenit was bombarded during some siegein the time of the civil wars was not itmamma i read it to you and it hashung over in the same leaning state eversince looking as if it would fall and yetnot falling i am glad we are to passthrough bridgenorth that we may see itwith our own eyes yes i shall like very much to see itsaid harrytheir father desired the postillion todrive slowly when he came into the townand harry and lucy's heads were first outof one window and then out of the othereager for the first sight of the hangingtowerthere it is cried harryof red brick said lucy i see iti had fancied that it was of grey old stonei expected to see a fine venerable ivy mantledtower i cannot help it said harry butmy dear take your head out of my wayfor i cannot see what i want to seethere you may have it all to yourselfmy dear harry said lucy i think itis very ugly nobody ever said it was pretty didthey said harry but it is a curiousthin of not nearly so curious as i expectedsaid lucy not nearly so dangerouslooking as i fancied it must be i hadhoped that it would quite take away mybreath to look at it and that we could notdrive by without fearing that it would fallupon our headsharry had no such fears or hopes becausehe recollected distinctly having readan account of it he knew that at pisathere is a tower which overhangs feetmuch more than this of bridgenorth hisfather asked him if he could tell why thesesloping towers continue to stand whatprevents them from falling harry do youknowharry said he believed he knew becausehe had read in scientific dialoguesan account of them and an explanation ofthe principle on which they stand know you did said his father andyou understood it at the time you readit but let me see if you understand itnow father it is very difficult to express itin words as lucy says but if i had mylittle bricks i could easily show the thingto youyes said lucy very often webuilt towers which leaned over and yetstood and we used to try how much wecould venture to make them overhangvrithout their falling i recollect that perfectlythough i do not know the reasonwhy they did not fallif i had the little bricks i could showand explain it said harrybut as you have them not and as youcannot always carry a hod of little bricksabout with you harry said his father try what you can do to explain yourselfby words those you may always have atcommandmay i wish i had said harrybegin harry by thinking of what youwish to express till you are quite clear thatyou know what you mean and dependupon it you will then easily find wordssaid his father people often imaginethat their difficulty is in finding wordswhen the real difficulty is in having clearideas of thingsthen you must if you please fathergive me time said harryas much time as you please said hisfather and that i may not hurry you iwill go on reading this bookthank you father said lucy forharryharry looked back at the hanging towerwhich was yet in view and after he hadthought till he was clear of what he meantto say without considering about the wordswhich came when he began to speak hewent on fluently after the first word fatherhad made his father look up and layaside his booksuppose that a plumbline was letdown from the centre of gravity of thewhole mass of that leaning tower thebob of the plumbline would fall withinthe base or foundations the plumblinecould not hang outside of the base or elsethe tower must tumble down as long asthe centre of gravity is supported any partmay lean over or may hang out of the perpendicularline and yet provided the materialsstick together the tower will not falli think i understand that said lucy but i am not quite clearif you do not understand what ismeant by the centre of gravity said herfather you cannot be quite clear indeedyou cannot comprehend it at alllucy said she remembered seeing harrywhen he was a little boy standing uponher father's knees and leaning his body somuch to one side that she was afraid hemust have fallen and papa you thenexplained to me how far he might haveleaned over without any risk of tumblingdown you also told me something aboutthe centre of gravity but that i do not recollectexactlyand of course i cannot remember it atall said harry but my father has oftenshown us that the motions of our tumblertoy depended on the situation of thecentre of gravity by the bye there isa way of finding out where the centreof gravity is in a body or figure of anyshapeis there said lucy i do not rememberpapa's showing us that how didyou learn it and if it is not very difficultcan you teach it to me who taughtit to youa book said harry my own goodscientific dialogues and if i had butabit of card and a bit of thread and apin and a pencil and if we were not inthe carriage i think i could show it toyou nowvol ii lbut as all these ifs stood in the waythe matter was put off for the present andlike many good things that are put oifwasforgotten nor can we much wonder thatthis was driven from the recollection evenof the philosophic harry by the bustle hesaw in the next town through which theypassed it happened that there was aotcat fair in this town and it was filledwith such crowds of people and so manystalls and booths covered with canvaslined the streets that it at first seemed impossiblethat way for their carriage andhorses could be made through them withouttrampling on some of the people oroverturning some of the tents the postillionstopped and called civilly to the peopleto make way red cloaks and greatcoatsyielded on each side and those infront got from under the horses noses asthey advanced step by step lucy hadlet down the glasses and was looking outwithgreat interest not unmixed with apprehensionand listening to the universal hubbub wildof stunning sounds and voices all confusedand as little by little the carriage madeits way through the dense multitude shesaw many hairbreadth escapes which madeher shrink and cry oh and ah many a time for those who were all unheedfulof their danger in the ardour ofbargaining the pleasure of gossiping thevehemence of scolding the stupidity ofstaring or the anxiety of maternal affectionhere was seen a mother crossing beforethe very pole of the carriage which nearlyran into her ear in so much haste wasshe to snatch out of the way two childrenstanding unconscious the one withan apple the other with a whistle in hismouth and close to the wheel of thecarriage at one time there was a youngwith pink cheeks bargaining soearnestly for a pink ribbon with an oldwoman in her booth that the wheel mustas lucy thought have gone over her outstretchedfoot but that just in time lookingl up she drew it in and still holding thedear ribbon in her hand continued herbargaining next there was a group ofold women leaning on their sticks withtheir bonnets close to each other tellingand listening to something so eagerly thatthey never heard the carriage coming tillthe wheel went over the point of one oftheir sticks and begrimed the scarletcloak of the speaker before she wouldmove her shoulder out of the waythen came an awkward clown on horsebackwith elbows out lugging at the hardmouth of his shagmaned colt who knewno more than his rider the way he shouldgo but who with glassy eyes starting outof his frightened head seemed to have amighty mind to run straight in at thecarriage window seeing which lucyducked directly how they passed sheknew not but when she looked up againthey were gone and harry's body was far outof the window watching the operations ofman and horse at the farther end of thestreet there was the colt flounderingand struggling with his rider at the cornerof the street where both vanishedbefore it was settled which would be victoriousbut now lucy saw before them in anew street a huge wooden house or caravanon wheels on the outside of which inlargeletters were written the names of thewild beasts who lodged within and whowere all to be seen for the sum of oneshilling across this part of the street hungflapping furious portraits coloured to thelife of a lion rampant a hyena a tigerand a mountain cat with enormous whiskerslucy began to be a little afraid that thepoor horses would be very much frightenedbut either they did not think the portraitsstriking likenesses or they were not sufficientlyacquainted with the originals andtheir private histories to be as much afraidas lucy thought they ought to be theywent by quite quiet yet were as lucyobserved most foolishly frightened soonafterwards by a poor little boy poppingout from under the long skirts of a puppetshowone reared the other shed buttheir driver being a temperate whip pattedthem into good humour and brought themon safely to the inn turning under thearchway they knew where they werelowered their prickedup ears and stoodperfectly still at the bardoor neighingby turns to their acquaintance in the yardwho answered from their inmost stallslucy found on the chimney piece of theroom where they were to dine an advertisementinforming the public that there is now in this town a new fairyinfinitely surpassing the old corsican fairywho appeared in england in the last centuryand who was honoured with the approbationof the nobility and gentry but thenew fairy is full an inch less than the oldfairy and can speak three languagesfrench english and italian dances toadmiration and waltzes inimitably if requiredwhile lucy was reading this cardharry was perusing another which hehad found on the table and which informedthe public that this evening at sixo'clock a company of tumblers would atthe theatre in this town exhibit for theamusement of the public several curiousfeats in tumbling and rope dancing oneman promised to carry a ladder poised onhis chin and another to balance a tableon the rope and even a chair on whichhe was himself to be seated with his bottlebefore him and quite at his easeharry was curious to see these sights he told lacy that here would be fine examplesof all they had been saying aboutthe centre of gravity these wonderfulthings must be done from understandinghow to manage that properly he wishedmore and more the longer he thought ofthis to see these tumblers lucy it mustbe confessed was not so curious on thissubject and she would much rather hadshe been to choose see the new corsicanfairytheir father and mother had determinedto sleep at the inn where they now wereand they told harry and lucy that theywould in the evening let them see eitherthe corsican fairy or the tumblers but toboth they could not take them as they werein opposite parts of the town the tumblersat the theatre the corsican fairy to beseen at the court house between the acts ofa concert lucy was fond of musicharry did not care for itwell harry and lucy which do youchoose said their father take fiveminutes to consider but then you mustdecide that we may engage our places orbuy our tickets in timelucy recollected the resolution she hadmade when first she set out upon thisjourney that she would imitate her mother'skindness of which she had seen so manyexamples she therefore gave up generouslyher own wish to hear the concertand see the fairy she did this in so kind amanner that she put her brother quite atease she was very happy with himseeing the tumblers and when it was allovershe was quite content with them andwith herselfat the end of the next day's journey ourtravellers arrived at clifton harry andlucy were delighted with the place andwere glad to learn that they were to spendsome days here in order that their mothermight rest herself the next morningafter their arrival they walked with theirfather on the downs from the top ofwhich they looked down a steep cliffand saw the river avon below theydescended to the river down the cliff by anew road which a number of workmen werethen making the workmen were breakingsome hollow stones which had fallenout of the bank by the side of the roadthe hollows of these stones were linedwith shining crystals lucy picked upbits of this stone and added them to thecollection which she had made at matlockthe stone that sparkled with crystals wascalled she was told bristol stone and thel crystals themselves were called bristol diamondslucy afterwards saw at the houseof a lady in clifton a cross of these bristoldiamonds and another cross of real diamondsand on laying the two side by sideshe could scarcely tell the differencethey had now descended to the bank ofthe river where they stood some time toadmire the cliff called st vincent's rockthey then walked to view an extensivequarry where some miners were blastingthe rocks with gunpowder they inquiredof the head workman to what use the stonewas applied he showed them some ofit which had been hewn into blocks andwas intended for paving the streets of bathand bristol the chipping he informedthem were not thrown away as uselessbut were after being broken very smallemployed to mend the roads the rockwas limestone harry saw some of it burningin a kiln and he was informed that itwas hard and when cut and polishedformed a handsome marble some of itwas of a reddish colour some grey andsome black but all might be convertedby burning into white lime the lime burnt at our kilns saidtheir conductor is very much soughtafter not only in this neighbourhood butalso in foreign parts we send it in casksto the west indiesdo you know said their father towhat use lime is applied in the west indiesharry and lucy replied that they supposedthat lime served there as it did inengland to make mortar and to manurelandit is also employed in making sugarsaid their fatherharry and lucy begged to be informedin what manneri am glad he replied that our visitto the lime quarry has turned our attentiontowards sugarmaking for on that subjectduring our stay at clifton we shallhave the best opportunity of informingourselves in the port of bristol we shallsee ships from the west indies unloadingtheir cargoes of sugar and on board ofthose ships if we are fortunate we shallfind some stems of the sugar cane in themanufactories here we shall meet with theapparatus required for making sugar whichapparatus is to be exported to the west indies here too are extensive refining houseswhere they extract from brown sugar thatpure white substance that you see everymorning on the breakfast table let uswalk at once to bristol and try to satisfyouj curiosity but tell me childrenwhether you already possess any informationon the subject of sugar makingharry and lucy replied that they hadread in edwards's west indies an accountof the sugar plantations in jamaica of thesugar canes and sugar millslucy was asked what she remembered ofthis she recollected that the sugar cane isa sort of strawcoloured jointed reed aboutthe thickness of the handle of an umbrellait grows in general to about the height ofa man and at its top are leaves like flagsthe canes are cut in autumn and thesugarmaking time is a season of gladnessand festivity to man and beast especiallyto the poor negroes who work in the plantationshere lucy was near going off far awayfrom the sugarmaking to talk of the poornegroes but her father called her backagain by the question of what is to bedone to the sugar canes after they are cutthey are tied in small bundles saidlucy and carried to the mill where thesugar juice is to be squeezed out of themlucy looked to harry for assistance whenshe came to the millit consists said harry of three largeiron rollers turned by wind or water orhorses or oxen or perhaps now the peoplemay have learned to work them withsteam the bundles of cane are passedbetween the rollers and squeezed againand again till all the juice is pressed outit is caught in a wooden gutter lined withlead and runs into the house where it isto be boiled it is said to be of greatconsequence to boil it as quickly as theycan but i do not know the reasonthe reason is lest it should fermentsaid his father do you know for whatpurpose it is boiled lucythat the water which is in the juicemay evaporate replied lucy and thaton cooling the liquor the sugar may crystallisedthere not being water enough tokeep it dissolved just as we saw thecrystallising of the alum for my basketthe boiling is also necessary saidher father to cause the other vegetablematters contained in the juice to separatein the form of scum when they are removedby the skimmer and here it isthat lime is so serviceable in rendering theseparation of this scum complete it alsorenders the liquid thinner and less viscidso that the particles of sugar can movefreely and crystallise more readily doyou remember harry by what name theycall that ropy portion of the liquor thatwill not crystallisemolasses answered harry whenthe sugar has crystallised it is put intocasks with holes in the bottom the molassesdrains to the bottom of the casks andruns out at the holesharry lucy and their father were stillengaged in talking about sugar when theyfound themselves arrived at the wet docksof bristol the wet docks are a basin ofwater formed by throwing floodgatesacross the ancient bed of the avon theriver itself being turned into an artificialchannel the water within the basin wasprevented by the floodgates from fallingwith the tide so that the ships were keptconstantly afloat even at low waterour party found the basin crowded withships they distinguished the ships arrivedfrom the west indies by the hogsheadsof sugar that the crews were hoistingout and by the black sailors whomthey saw on board on the decks ofthese vessels they observed some of thesailors and boys sucking some pieces ofthe sugar cane on account of their sweetnessharry noticed in a warehouse ashewalked along the parts of a rollingmill for squeezing the canes and pans ofiron and copper for boiling the juicemen were employed in packing these forexportation our party continued theirwalk until they arrived at the end of thebasin and then turned homewards towardsclifton highly delighted with all that theyhad seen on their rambleon the following morning as they satat breakfast the subject of sugarmakingwas resumedthe art as practised in the westindies is still very imperfect said theirfather much of the sugar existing inthe juice is lost by injudicious managementtwo sweet substances are containedin the juice sugar which crystalliseseasily and molasses which is incapableof doing so the planter shouldendeavour to obtain from the juice all thesugar that it contains when first expressedwith as little of the molasses adhering tothe sugar as possible but sugar by beingoverheated loses its power of crystallisingand is converted into a substanceresembling the molasses much sugar istherefore destroyed in boiling the juicerapidly and the quantity thus destroyedincreases the proportion of molassesi have often burnt a piece of sugarin a candle said harry when burntit remains sweet but it becomes brownsoft and sticky the same change takes place saidhis father when a strong solution of sugaris heated in a vessel over the firewhen only a little hotter than boilingwater it begins to undergo this change sothat a part of it loses the property of crystallisingon coolingharry and lucy were sorry to learn thatso much of the sugar raised by the hardtoil of the poor negro was spoilt and expressedtheir hopes that some remedymight be devised for the evil much of the sugar brought to thiscountry used formerly to be wasted in thesame manner said their father but inconsequenceof late improvements that isno longer the case and what are those improvementssaid harry of which you now speakthat is what i propose to show you thisvery morning said his father for imean that we should see the new processof refining in one of the sugar houses atbristol so now let us talk about refiningthat you may understand what you seethepeople doing have either of youheard or read any thing concerning sugarrefiningharry said that he had heard that bullock'sblood was made use of at the sugarhouses but in what manner and for whatpurpose it was applied he did not knowwhen brown sugar has been dissolvedin water said his father the blood isemployed to clarify the solution that isto remove the impurities the blood ismixed in a liquid state with the cold solutionof sugar it coagulates on the applicationof a moderate heat and rises in theform of scum which is then removed fromthe surface but in the suoar house that wearegoing to see this clarifying process isdispensed with it being found that muchsugar is wasted by being mixed with thescum from which it cannot afterwards beseparateddo not you remember harry saidlucy a story concerning a process calledclaying by what an accident it was firstfound out that clay was good for sugar good for whitening sugar i mean i do not recollect said harry so much the better said lucy fori shall have the pleasure of telling it toyou it is a very curious thing about a hen tell it to us my dear lucy i adviseyou said her mother without raisingour expectations lest it should disappointus afterwardsthen you must know mamma thatone day a hen who had been walking insome wet clayey place and had clay stickingto the bottom of her feet happenedto tread on the top of a pot of sugarit was soon afterwards observed thatthe sugar beneath the marks of the hen'sfootsteps was whiter than elsewhere andfrom observing this and considering howit had happened people thought of usingclay to whiten sugar very ingenious said harry andlucy remembered it well just at the righttime for us did not she mamma i hadquite forgotten it but i recollect it allnow the sugar is put into a vessel ofthe shape of a sugarloaf which is placedon its narrow end then clay moistenedwith water is put over the top of the sugarand the water by slow degrees quitsthe clay and oozes very slowly downthrough the sugar the water mixes withand dilutes the molasses and carries itdown to the bottom i forgot to tell youthat there is a hole at the bottom of thevessel this hole is stopped at first by aplug but afterwards a man takes out theplug and lets the stuff run off that hadbeen oozing to the bottomso men learned from the hen to claysugar said lucy we are very muchobliged to the hen are not we mammawhen next i see very white sugar ishall say to myself thank you for thatmrs henyou will be doings mrs hen farmore honour than she deserves repliedher father for in the sugar house thatwe are about to visit the operation of clayingis laid aside the art of refining asnow practised is a new discovery andhas arisen not from mere lucky accidentbut from judiciously combining sound scientificprinciples with accurate observation how is that said harry drawingcloser and listening with great eagerness this continued his father is oneof the happy applications of science to thecommon purposes of life in improving themanufacture of a substance so agreeableand almost necessary we learnt yesterdayhow to extract brown sugar from raw canejuice we are now to be taught how to obtainfrom brown sugar the pure saccharinematter as white and as hard and as crystallineas that which you see daily on theteatable we should know the natureand properties of the foreign ingredientsin brown sugar to be able to producepure sugar completely separated from thembesides various impurities brown sugaras i have already told you consists of twosweet substances sugar forming smallcrystals and molasses which remains in asemi fluid state the latter being combinedwith a dark colouring matter which rendersthe sugar brown molasses differsfrom sugar in remaining semi fluid whereassugar remains solid now if a smallquantity of water be added to a mixtureof molasses and sugar the whole of themolasses will be rendered fluid and onlya small portion of the sugar so that bymeans of water the constituent parts ofbrown sugar may be separatedi see plainly said harry that bymixing a little water with brown sugarand by putting the mixture into a mouldsuch as they use in claying i should beable to free the sugar from a large portionof the molassesvery well said his father i seethat by stating to you a few facts and byputting to you a few questions we shalllead you to invent the new improvementsyourself there is nothing i like better than tobe taught in that way said harryit is a good exercise for you and foreverybody said his fatherpray help us when we cannot get onsaid lucy to help you then to get on said herfather some previous explanations arenecessary it is only the small crystalsof brown sugar that we have learntto free from molasses to come at thematter within the large crystals we mustdissolve them completely in water andbefore they are crystallised the syrupmust be freed from the colouring matterand from all impurities but how is thecolouring matter to be separated from thesyrup i know that alum is used by thedyers to separate colours from liquidssaid lucythat property depends on the earthwhich alum contains said her fatherand this earth being mixed with thesyrup attracts the brown colour to itselfcharcoal made of bones is sometimesemployed for the same purposewhen added to the deepestcoloured winesit is able to deprive them of their rednesswhen the process of discharging thecolour is completed the earth of alum orthe charcoal together with all the impuritiesare to be separated by means of thefilter and when the liquor has run throughit then requires to be evaporated i know papa said lucy fromwhat you before told us that the syrupmust not be heated in a vessel over anaked fire yet in what manner to boilaway the water if not over a fire i cannotimaginei told you said her father that thesugar would be injured if made hotter thanboiling water i think then i know how to contriveit said lucy i would boil it as theysometimes do things in the kitchen bysteam i have heard you say papa thatsome great buildings are heated by steami do not know exactly how to set aboutit but i think the sugar might be boiledby steam that is well thought of said harryvol ii mi would conduct steam through pipesunder the pan that holds the sugaryou are both of you on the right roadto the principal improvement in sugar boilingsaid their father but yet you havenot fully mastered the difficulty by the niethouthat you have suggested one might beable to heat the sugar but certainly notto boil it for you knows that a solution ofsugar if in an open vessel requires astronger heat to make it boil than waterdoesbut i should think said harry thatby confining steam it could be made muchhotter than boiling water and in that casewith compressed steam i might be ableto boil syrupyou might so said his father andsome persons do boil sugar in that way but highpressure steam as it is calledis hazardous to deal with and by thismethod also we risk the overheating ofthe sugar turn your thoughts thereforeanother way and instead of raising thetemperature of the steam consider whetherthere are not means of making syrupor any other fluid boil at a lower temperaturethan when exposed to the commonatmosphereharry considered for some time and atlength said i am not certain whether icould succeed with syrup but i have seenwater made to boil when only moderatelywarm by putting it under the receiver ofan air pumphow did that happen said his fatherbecause there was a vacuum saidharry there was no pressure of the atmosphereif we could place the sugarpan under the receiver of an air pump thatperhaps might do but the quantity ofsugar to be boiled puzzles me father thesugar vessels are very large i believe icould only boil a very small quantity inan air pump so that after all it wouldnot do i supposewhy will not it do said his fatherm do not give up your ideas too hastily till you are sure that they will not answernever fly off to any thing else do not fixyour imagination upon the particular receiverof the air pump you have seento be sure you could not conjure a sugarboiler into that small receiverno to be sure said harry laughingthen becoming quite grave again he wenton thinking how shall i manage itit is impossible to blow a glass large enoughfor the receiverwhy do you stick to the notion of aglass receiver harry said his fatherdo you think it essential to the havinga vacuum that it should be produced inglass certainly not said harry it is notnecessary by any means i only thoughtof the glass one because that was the onlyreceiver i had seen but i perceive thatany other substance that is airtight will doas well as glass how foolish i am iremember now the pump and the steamengine where the vacuum is large enough or a vessel might be made as large as couldbe required for the purpose now you have it harry the sugaris boiled in a vacuum and that vacuum isproduced by means of an air pump theexact details i do not knows having neverseen it done myself but i hope we shallsee it today and so now let us set outthe sugar house which harry and lucywent to see was a large building of eightstories high the first circumstance whichstruck them on entering it was that in severalspacious rooms through which theypassed and in which the work seemed to begoing on there were not many workmenlucy supposed that it was thehour of dinner as had happened in someother manufactories which they had seen but she was told that this was not the case and that all the men who were ever employedin this sugar house were nowthere few only were necessary becauseso much was done by machinery in truththe men seemed of little importance itappeared as if they were employed only asunderservants to the machines and to dotrifling things which the mechanic and thechemist had not thought it worth theirwhile to invent the means of affection inany other waythe large rooms and passages throughwhich they passed were all warm as lucyobserved and yet she could not anywhereperceive any fire she asked how theywere warmed and was told that she wouldsoon see as they were going to theplace from whence the warmth cametheir guide the gentleman who was sokind as to show them these works tookthem to a building separate from the restin which there was a steam engine thefire under its boilers was the only fire usedin these works all the rooms were heatedby steam that passed through pipes in thewalls or under the floorsharry was here perfectly satisfied andhe looked delighted and proud when heheard how much was performed by onesteam engine it sent over this vastbuilding equable warmth and suppliedall the water that was wanted in everypart of the works it put in motion a millfor crushing the sugar and other substancesused in refining it and it kept inunremitting action the pistons of a hugeair pumpafter having seen or heard what wasdone by this steam engine the greatmoving power on which all the rest dependedthey followed their guide into asort of outhouse in which the earth ofalum was prepared by adding quicklimeto a solution of itthey then entered that part of thebuilding where the preparatory operationsof cleansing the sugar were performedthey saw in the first place afew workmen with naked arms and inlight clothing suited to their hot workstirring with huge shovels in a great panthe raw brown sugar such as it is whenbrought from the west indies they werestirring it up with a small quantity ofwater not sufficient to dissolve it it lookedlike treacle this was afterwards pouredinto earthen moulds of which there weregreat numbers in the shape of sugarloaves such as those of which they hadread a description with a hole at thepoint which was turned downwards andin these moulds it was to be left twentyfourhours to filter in the course of that timethe molasses would pass through into jarsbeneath the sugar loaf moulds and thesugar left behind would be in solid lumpsof a light brown colour some of thesugar thus purified was put into lucy'shand she felt that it was soft enough tobe readily crushed it was now to bedissolved in water which was heated byhaving steam passed through it theearth of alum which they called finingswas then added to this solution and thoroughlystirred about by passing currentsof steam through itthis was performed in a great squarecistern which had a double bottom andsides with a space left between sufficientto introduce the steam the inner bottomand sides were perforated with minuteholes and through these holes the steampassed up into the liquid sugar theyheard a rapid succession of explosionsoccasioned by the sudden condensation ofthe steam and when the solution becamehot they saw immense volumes of steamrising through it after this treatmentthe syrup was allowed to run into the filterthe filter appeared on the outside like agreat square chest and the inside wasdivided into parallel compartments bycoarse linen cloth which was stretchedover frames of copper the liquor wasadmitted into every alternate cell and wasthus filtered in passing into the contiguouscells on either side which were empty thesyrup flowed out from the filter a transparentfluid of a pale straw colourthey were now conducted to the mostremarkable part of the new apparatus theevaporating pans in which the water wasdriven off from the syrup they werem made with double bottoms so as to admitsteam between the two for heating thesyrup and the pans were covered withdomes of copper these domes communicatedwith the air pump the great pistonsof which were kept at work by thesteam engine these served to pump outthe air so as to preserve as far as possiblea vacuum over the liquid the perfectionof the vacuum was shewn by a barometerthe master of the sugar houseinformed them that it required one hundreddegrees less heat to boil sugar invacuo than in the ordinary method andthat it was accomplished in less than onefifthof the time formerly requisiteafter having been evaporated the heatof the sugar was brought to a certaintemperature at which it was found mostdisposed to crystallise it was then pouredinto earthen moulds of the form of a sugarloaf such as were before described andin these it was allowed to consolidateit is then of a tolerably white colourand is finally purified by being washedo with a solution of the finest white sugarwhich is suffered to filter through it thetop and the bottom of the loaves as beingless pure are then pared off in a and the loaves are afterwardsdried in a stovelucy said that before she came tothe sugar house she had a general ideafrom what she had read and heard thatsuoar went through several processes offiltering and boiling and cooling andcrystallising before it could be white andfit for the teatable but still she was surprisedby seeing the number of the differentoperations the size of the vessels andthe power and time necessary she hadnot been tired by what she had seen becauseshe knew beforehand the generalpurpose and she had not been puzzled oranxiousharry was delighted at seeing that principlewhich he had before so clearly understoodcarried into practice with successin such great works i hope you will now acknowledgesaid he to lucy that the air pump is ofsome use in common life and i hope youare convinced now that the air pump is almostas useful as the water pumplucy acknowledged this and said thatharry might well triumph for the airpumpthink said harry of its being appliedto such different things as makingsugarand making ice and not only employedfor boiling quickly but for freezingquickly i do not think that otto garrickor mr boyle himself could have foreseenall the uses that were to be made oftheir own inventions i wish they couldsee all we have been shown this morning so do i said lucy wish theycouldall goes back to that one great principleof the vacuum said harrythe gentleman who had shown themthis establishment and who had with thegreatest patience and politeness explainedevery part of the business was glad to perceivethat he had given pleasure to the youngpeople and that they had attended to andunderstood what they had seen and heardhe begged that they would rest themselvesbefore they went away and showed theminto a room where they found refreshmentswere prepared he gave a cup of chocolateto lucy and another to harryyou must said he taste some ofthe sugar which has been refined by theprocess you have just seenit was in a black wedgwood ware basinwhich showed its whiteness but father cried harry eagerly can you tell me who invented the methodof applying the air pump so beautifully tothis use i can tell you said his father itwas the invention of edward howardbrother to the duke of norfolk he wasan honour to his family and i hopeaddressing himself to the master of thesugar house that he has been amply rewardedfor his ingenuity by the gentlemenof your profession the fruits have been ample said themaster but he did not himself reap themthey are enjoyed by his family he onlyjust lived to perfect his inventionthe master of the sugar house then enteredinto a statement of the prodigiousquantity of sugar saved by adopting the newprocess eight pounds of sugar he saidwere saved in each hundred weight andhe helped harry to make a calculation ofwhat that amounted to every year uponthe total quantity of sugar refined in greatbritainour party having finished their chocolatethanked their host for his attentionand took their leave of himas you go down the hill from cliftonto bristol you may see in the city belowa number of very high blacklookingbuildings in the shape of hugecones from which still darker colouredsmoke in thick black billows is continuallyissuing these conicalshapedbuildings are glasshouses lucy rememberedher father's having showed her andtold her of what glass is made sherecollected the taste of the alkali of theashes of weeds and the touch and sightof the sand she recollected also thestory of the accident by which it is saidthe making of olass was first discovered and above all she remembered the pleasurethat harry and she had had in seeingthe thermometer man blowing tubesand bulbs of glass with his blowpipeshe wished very much to see some moreolassblowino her father took her andher brother one day to a glassblower's herfirst feeling on entering the glasshousewas alarm on seeing a number of menwith ladles full of redhot liquid fire asit appeared running past her and everyminute crossing each other with theseburning masses with which they seemedin imminent danger of scalding oneanother to death but when she observedtheir dexterity and their fearlessnessand saw how much they were atease as to the danger she by degrees wasreassured and able to be amused shesaw in the first place furnaces fromwhich were taken earthen pots filled withredhot liquid glass she was puzzledat first by the workmen calling thecontents of these pots jiietal but thatwas only their name for what was inreality as harry said glass she wasmuch amused by seeing the operationsof the glassblower first the blowingof a glass bottle and of a wine glassone circumstance in the finishing of thewine glass struck her particularly whenhe cut its rim round with a pair of shearsthe glass being as yet soft yielded underthe pressure of the shears so that the wineglasswas no longer quite circular nor wasthe rim even the workman then heatedthe wine glass again and dextrously twirlingit round it was brought back to thecircular shape and its rim was evenharry's father asked him why this happenedhe said he thought that it was turnedinto a circular shape by the pressure ofthe air as it was whirled round while softas any other substance is made circularby the pressure of the tool when turninground in a lathe and he thought thatthe air with inside of the glass preventedits being driven in and squeezed togetherby the motionhis father told him that he was partlyright in his supposition but there was onereason one cause to which he had not advertedand which he had not yet perceivedhe would say no more becauseperhaps by observing further he would discoverit for himself in attending to anotheroperation the blowing of window glassor crown glass as it is called first agreat pearshaped bubble of glass about afoot in diameter was blown at the end ofan iron tube to which being soft and hotit adhered then by rolling the pearshapedbulb upon a smooth marble tableand blowing into it and by repeating theseoperations alternately several times and bywhirling it rapidly round near a hot firethe bulb was brought from its pear shapeinto that of a globe the globe was thencut open opposite to the iron tube andafter being whirled again with great swiftnessthe parts spread out still more tillby continuing this operation it became alarge circular plate of flat glassharry now perceived what he hadomitted in the case of the drinking glassthe centrifugal force or that force whicharises from the tendency the pails ofbodies have to fly from their centre whenturned round rapidlyas he left the glass house he continuedhis explanationi suppose father that the parts ofthe soft glass as they are whirled roundendeavoured to fly from the centre and byso doing the globe became a larger globeand the circular plates became largercircles and all the parts flying off equallyfrom the centre the rim of the drinkingglass became quite circularit is said lucy not exactly butsomething like a mop yes harry amop when the maid twirls it roundfast the threads of the mop all fly out asfar as they can go from the centre andif it was a wet mop out fly circles beyondcircles of drops well said harry you have madeout your likeness to a mop better than ithought you couldi remember continued lucy thefirst day i ever heard of centrifugal forceor had any idea of what it meant it wasfrom you harry when i was making apancake papa a pancake my dear i do not rememberyour ever making a pancakeperhaps it was a cheese said lucysome people i believe call it a cheesenot a cheese or a pancake to eat papa but i will show you as soon as we are inmammas roomlucy kept her word and whirling herselfround the moment she was in hermother's room the skirts of her petticoatsflew out and as she popped downwardswhile they swelled out she exclaimedthere is a pancake papa or a cheesewhichever you please and it is madeharry by centrifugal force is not iti have been very much amused continuedlucy seeing the glassblowingwere not you harry very much indeed and it has left agreat deal to think of and to inquire moreabout said harrywhat more said lucy a great deal repeated harry forone thing annealing i do not understandthati recollect said lucy that whenthe man had twirled the wine glass roundand finished it a boy came with a long pairof tongs and seizing the glass ran away withit as our man said to the annealing furnaceto be annealed and when i askedwhat that was and what was to be donemore to it the man showed me a pan inan oven and i saw our wine glass withmany others put into it to be heated againand then to be left to cool slowly theman told me they ought to take severaldays to cool this was done to make theglass less brittle he said and this is annealingwhat more harry would youknow about ita great deal more if i could saidharry in the first place i do not inthe least know icy annealing makes glasslessbrittle why oh that is another affairwhy nor i said lucyand i heard papa and the mastermanin the glass house talking of a curiousfact he said that when a glass vesselof a particular shape is allowed to coolimmediately after being made it will oftensustain the shock of a pistol bullet or anyother blunt body falling into it from a considerableheight but a small splinter offlint dropped gently into it makes it fly topieces with great violenceindeed said lucy that is verycuriousso papa said and they went off totalk about prince rupert drops ohmy dear there are a great many manymore curious things to be known aboutglass and all the whys more than in mylife perhaps i shall ever know but you need not know all the ivhyssaid lucy but as many as i can said harrythere was a man came in while we werein the glass house did you see himlucyi did a gentleman you meani do not know whether he was agentleman or not said harry he wasa manbut i know he was a gentleman saidlucy by his coat or his waistcoat or hishat said harry smilingby neither by none of those saidlucy by something better by the wayhe spoke by his tone his language iknew he was a gentlemanand i by what he said knew him tobe a man of sense said harry hecame to inquire for a person who grindsglasses for telescopesthen he must be a man of sense to besure said lucy smiling in her turn my dear you have not heard all hewas trying experiments to improve themaking of those glasses i did not understandall he said but it made me verycurious to know morepapa seemed to like him said lucyyes said harry papa and hetalked of what a fine useful discovery glassis and how long before people thought ofmaking all the uses that are now made ofitit happened that the next day harrywent with his father to the house of a physicianwho had a good library and whilehis father and the physician were busy heasked leave to look for something hewanted in some of the books the physiciangave him leave and to work hewent searching for a chemical dictionaryor encyclopedia in which he might findaymealmg and glass the volume containingannealing was missing hethought this very provoking but likemany things which we think very provokingit was really fortunate and wellfor him had he found it he would nothave understood the article he had notthe previous knowledge necessary and hewould have lost his labour if not hispatience he went in search of glass andthere he found much that he could notbut some that he could comprehend as hewas both enthusiastic and indefatigable hesearched all through it and had the greatpleasure of picking out several entertainingthings seizing on all that was suited tothe present state of his knowledge he leftthe rest for another time one passagedelighted him so much from describingexactly what they had seen and what hewould have found it difficult to explainthat he scribbled a copy of it for lucyscribbled truth compels us to say for itwas scarcely legible when he came toread it to lucy he could hardly make itout even with her best assistance and shecould read his running hand better than hecould himself but as she observed thishand had run almost quite away my dear i wrote it in a desperatehurry and on a crumpled back of a letterwith a pencil that wanted cutting andmy father was standing up with his hatand his gloves in his hands i thoughthe was going every instant while i waswriting the three last lines scribblescribble scribble as fast as ever my pencilcould go thank you said lucy for doingit for me but what is this about a cham saw no chain at the glass house chain my dear lucy it is chairsaid harrychair oh now i understand it allsaid lucy it is the description of whatwe saw of the men making the drinkingglass the man sitting in the armchairand blowing through his long iron tube then rolling it on the arm of the chair and the other man sticking on the foot ofthe glass and then taking the chair ohvol ii ni see it all again it is very well described i am glad you think so said harryit is more than the man who wrote itexpected expected did he ever think of mesaid lucy opening her eyes very wide no no my dear said harry laughing you may let your eyebrows downasrain the author never thought of youin particular i meant only his readers ingeneralyes said lucy mis young readersi suppose he said as people often do inbooks is that what you mean harry i mean nothing replied harry butthat the w river says he could hardly expectby any description of his to make glassblowing intelligible now that is all goonto something elsewith all my heart cried lucy hereare some more scribbled notes of yoursharry what does this meanbrave man and quick handsedinburgh encyclopediathrouoli flames covered with wetskins eyes of glass what can this mean v do you remember said harry seeinga great furnace at the glass house you saw only the outside they could notuncover it to show the inside to any bodylest they should have let in the cold airinto that furnace they put the earthen potsfull of glass which had been annealedand they left them there to set as theycalled it if one of these pots happen tobreak it is a terrible difficulty to get it outand put another in its place the gettingout the broken one can be done wellenough by a man at arms length from thefire with a long iron hook or a fork butthe man who is to put in the new pot canhave no use of hook or fork he must putthe new pot into its place with his handspassing them through the flamesthen indeed said lucy you miohtwell call him brave man and quick hemust do it as quick as lightning but he could not do it as quick asnlightning or do it at all said harryv without precautions he must bedressed my dear in skins which are all aswet as possible and they must cover himall over all but his eyes two holes are leftfor him to see through but these aredefended with thick glassesi am sure i am very much obliged toyou harry said lucy for bringing mehome such entertaining things that manbrave and quick as you called him wasworth reading all glass through to get athow many pages did you hunt through tofind him i came upon him by accident saidharry but i met with several otherthings which interested me and i thoughti would bring them away in my head foryou and i have them somewhere thereif i could but recollect them but i cannotwhen i try in a hurrydo not try then said lucy wheni try too hard to remember i never canrecollect what i want but then it comesall back aofain when i am thinking ofsomething else so now harry look atthis nice little glass tumbler which papabought for mamma's dressing box inplace of that which i broke it is prettierthan the old one look at its prettywhiteleafy border that is ground glasspapa said and this part below like crystalsis cut glass and papa told me howthis was donetwo of the very things i was tryingto recollect said harry then i neednot tell you about thatno said lucy what a beautifultransparent clear clean thing glass iscontinued she and how very usefuland in how many different ways drinkingglasses and lookingglasses you maysmile harry but men use lookingglassesas well as women yes said harry and for better purposetoo than looking at themselves theyuse lookingglasses you know for someastronomical instrumentsyes and for shaving too said lucy or they would cut their throats mightygrand you were about the astronomicalinstruments added she laughing butlet me go on my own way in honour ofglass to tell you all that i know besideslookingglasses there are magnifyingand diminishing glasses both very usefuland entertaining and then spectacles oh harry what would grand mamma dowithout them and how happy she iswith them reading and working as wellas i can at eightysix what a wonderfulinvention spectacles are by which peoplecan see so many years longer than theycould in former times spectacles i thinkharry are the most ingenious things peopleever made of glassdo not forget telescopes my dearsaid harry the most wonderful of man'sinventionshow curious it is said lucy thatall these things spectacles and telescopeswould never have been thought of butfor that first bit of glass which the shipwreckedsailors observed when they wereboiling their kettle on the sand with thethe fire made of sea weed do you rememberharry my father's telling us thatstoryi do said harry and now thatputs me in mind of what i wanted to sayto you it was about that story it istold in the book i was reading today andi was glad to meet with it there was alittle difference the sailors supported theirkettles on the sand with pieces of fossilalkali nitre with which their ship had beenloadedand in our old story said lucy thefire was made of weeds and the alkalicame from their ashes which burned withthe sand and made glass there is verylittle difference in the stories it all comesto the same things i know it does said harry buti was going to say something quite differentsay it then my dear said lucy what time did you think that storyhappened said harry t do not know said lucy i hardlyever think about time in stories i thinkit was in former times a great while agoin the time of pliny or before saidharry he tells the storyvery likely said lucy i do notcare who tells itbut my dear said harry what i wantyou to care for is the wonder that it shouldbe so long since glass and the way ofmaking it were first discovered by thatlucky accident and yet that it should behundreds of years before it was broughtinto common use you know the ancientsthe greeks and romans had not glass aswe have i thought that they had glass bottlesin old roman times said lucy i remembersomething about a bottle of glassin the roman history which a man broughtto the emperor tiberius i think and hedashed it to pieces when he was provokedand the emperor put him to death for it donot you remember harry my reading itloud to mamma and your being so angrywith that tyrant i remember that perfectly well saidharry but that was only one particularbottlebut besides that particular bottlesaid lucy i recollect hearing mrs franklandtell mamma that there were plates ofglass found in the ruins of herculaneumdid he said harryyes said lucy and from that itis supposed that glass windows were usedbv the ancients perhaps so said harry but mydear lucy to go no farther than englandmy book says that the english had notglass windows for many hundred years afterthat the windows of houses and churcheswere covered with linen cloth till towardsthe end of the tenth century you mean till about the year said lucy it was not till after the days of queenelizabeth said harry that it was quitecommon for houses to have glass windows how very stupid people must havebeen in those former days then said lucyn so it seems said harry and yet isuppose they were not naturally more stupidthan we are now recollect virgiland homer my dear but then the ancientshad not many men of scienceand then came the dark ages as ourhistory calls them said lucy and inthe dark ages i suppose people fell asleepand could not think of glass or any thingelse even when they wakened therewere not many that could write or readyou know harrythey had very few books to readsaid harry except the ancient greekand roman books over again and theyhad scarcely any books of experiments ibelievethey had only manuscripts saidlucy written on parchment or on papyrusi remember papa once showed meapapyrus manuscript in a museum andi saw parchment rolls too which the ancientscalled booksand what work there must have beenmaking copies enough of those manuscriptbooks said harry for people to readand how few copies of books a man couldmake after all and be could do nothing'elseno wonder the people were stupefiedsaid lucybut then happily was invented thegrand art of printing said harryyes i remember said lucy seeingit in capital letters in the memorableevents and when i first read of it i didnot know why so much was said about itsbeing such a grand invention now ibeoin to understand better by the bveharry you have seen a printingpressi never saw one and i should like to seehow they print i think that my fatherwas asking something about printingpressesin bristolyes said harry he told me that hewill take you to see one if he has timei wish it may be tomorrow saidlucy we have very few days more tostay at clifton i hope papa will havetime to show me the printingpress butinthe mean time harry will you play atcup and ball with me look what a prettyivory cup and ball mamma has given mei thought of it several times while youwere talking of glass but i would not interruptyou now let us have a trial onthe spike which will catch it the oftenestwill you spin the ball for mewhat is the use of spinning ita question easily asked very difficultto answermamma i am sorry that you could notgo with us to see the printingpress to dayfor it was very entertaining and looksaid lucy i am not covered with printer sink as you said i should beif you did not take care my dear isaid did not i yes mamma but i did take care yousee for i have not a single spot and yet isaw every thing perfectly mamma youhave seen printing so often i suppose thatit would be tiresome to describe it to youand i shall only tell you that it was donealmost exactly as is explained in our bookof trades in the chapter of the printerdo you remember my reading it to youmamma and the picture of the letterpressprinter and at the end it was said thatafter reading this young people should endeavourto go through a printing officei asked you directly mamma to take meto see one and you said that you couldnot then but that you would some time orother and now the sometimeorotherwhich i thought never would arrive hascome to day i saw the letters or thetypes all in their square divisions in theircases which lay sloping within reach ofthe compositor who with his composingstick in his hand picked out the lettersand placed them in the form then anotherman inked their faces with a blackpuffball and afterwards the wet paperwas pressed down on them i knew and understoodalmost every thing he was goingto do mamma from recollections descriptionthis was very pleasant therewas one thing though which i had mistaken when i took up one of the types isaw that the letter stands out from the faceof the metal it projects now i had alwaysfancied that the letters were hollowed outcut into the types as the letters for instanceof your name mamma are cut into thissealhow could you think so lucy saidharry you know that would be engravingthat is the way engravings aremadeyes now i recollect i know that isthe way engraving is done but i thoughtin printing books it was the same and iknow now what led me into the mistakeit was our little ivory letters which we puttogether so as to spell out words they areall cut into the ivory and filled up withinkbut does not your book of tradeslucy describe how the letters are madesaid her mother no mamma not that i recollectsaid lucy i dare say the author supposedevery body must know it but i didnot that is my fault i am afraid said hermother not yours mamma but the fault of theman the author of the book of trades ifit is any body's fault but indeed itmust be very difficult for great grownupold authors to recollect the time whenthey did not know every thing or anythingthemselves and very tiresome tothem to explain every little particular fromthe very beginning it must be difficulttoo for wise authors to guess or conceivethe odd sort of little foolish mistakes thatchildren makeharry waited till lucy had done speakingand then told her that the manner inwhich letters are made is described in thebook of trades under the head typefounderis it indeed said lucy then i readvery carelessly but i remember the calicoprinter perfectly well and how histypes or his blocks and patterns are madei know the pattern is first drawn on theblock of wood a leaf and flower for instancesuch as there is on this curtainthen with a very sharp knife or a littlechisel they cut away the wood all roundthe pattern and between every part of it soas to leave it standing up and standing outin relief said her mother then they rub colours on this patternsaid lucyas the other printer rubs ink on histypes said harryand the calico printer stamps it downon the calicojust as the letterpress printer did thepaper on the types said harryhow comes it lucy said her motherthat you remember so accurately all thiscalico printer's businessoh mamma for an excellent reasonwhich harry knows do not you harryi do said harry smilingmamma harry was a calico printeronce and printed a blue starred gown formy doll said lucyand a pretty blotted blurred gown itwas said harryi liked it the best of all her crownsand so did she said lucy and wewere so happy doing it mamma exceptwhen harry cut his finger hacking at theblock added lucy shrinking at the recollection what signified a cut said harry but i broke the point of my knife andthat was the reason the star was but abotch at last the worst of it was said lucy thatthe stars all came out the first time it waswashed but that was not your faultharry but the washerwoman'smore probably the fault of the coloursyou used said her mother or elsewhy did not the colours wash out of yourown gowns the same person washed themthat is an unanswerable argumentsaid harrytherefore i will not attempt to answerit said lucyi am glad of it said harry i wantto qfo on to sonietliinof else mother it isvery extraordinary that printing shouldnot have been invented for so many hundredsof yearsthe same thing we said about glasscried lucyit is surprising that the ancients shouldnot have invented printing harry saidhis mother because they had in commonuse contrivances vshich might with a littlemore thought and ingenuity have led themto the inventionwhat do you mean mamma saidlucyi think my mother means their sealsand their medals said harry theirseals were made like ours with letterscut inyes in intaglioy said his motherbut how did you know that harry i knew it mother from one of thelarge books of prints which you used tolend me to look at at night when i was athomemontaubaneyes mamma there were in that bookfigures and descriptions of several verylarge roman seals in which there werenames in capital letters i brought youthe book one night mamma when it wasso large and heavy i could hardly hold iti remember and asked you to tell mesomething of those seals and to read andtranslate a bit of the description to me forit was french and you were so good asto do it mamma i am very glad i was since you rememberit and that it is useful to you solong afterwards my dear boy said hismotherit said that those great seals wereused for marking some large earthen vesselsin which the romans kept their winethey stamped them down on the clay vesselswhile the clay was soft and then ithardened and the letters remainedjust like our seals on wax said lucyi think mother continued harrythat all those great seals had the lettersatocut in and not in reliefyes and of all which he gives representationsi think he never found any withthe letters in relief but we are sure thatthere were such in use among the ancientsfor i recollect it is said that some of thenames on those wine vessels were cut in tothe clay that is in intaglio which youknow is a proof that they were made by aseal or type that was in relief in theruins of pompeii loaves of bread have beenfound with letters stamped upon them andvirgil mentions the branding of cattlethen said lucy they actually didknow how to print without knowing it wonder when they had such trouble incopying writing that they never inventeda printing press how stupid when theysaw the letters on the jars standing beforetheir eyes continued lucy but i supposethat from only seeing one name or afew letters at a time it never came intotheir headswere there any roman seals everfound do you know mother said harryof the rare kind with the letters in reliefin which there was more than one word yes i believe said his mother thatthe duke of richmond has in his collectiona seal on which there are four wordsthe four names of the roman to whom itbelonged and this seal belonged it isthought not to any emperor or great manbut to some private individual thereforeit is believed that such seals were in commonuse amoncr the romans and they never invented printing afterall said lucy the germans or thedutch i believe invented itand how did they come to it at lastdo you know mother said harrythat is disputed and not yet settledmy dear said his mother some saythe hint was taken from these roman seals others from the seeing the names of saintscut on blocks of wood under their imagesother people think that the idea was suggestedby the seeing the manner in whichcards were stampedindeed said lucy but thosewere from wooden blocks not metal lettersor typestrue and the first books were printedfrom wooden blocks said her mother some of these are still preserved in publiclibraries as curiositiesi should like to see one said lucyyou would see how coarse they wereand how inferior to our improved printingto be sure from these clumsy woodenblocks said harry but i suppose theysoon got rid of thosethe chinese use wooden blocks still ibelieve said his mother and it is saidthey had the art of printing long before itwas known in europemore shame then for them said lucysince they have not improved it all thistime what use wooden blocks stillwhat blockheadsgently gently said her motherthere may be some reasons for thiswhich you do not know they have not ouralphabetbut without going oft to defend orattack the chinese let us go on with ourown affairs said harry what camenext mamma and how did the people getto the printing press the first improvement made afterthe printing whole words with woodenblocks was the making moveable letters then the same letters could be used overand over again and as many made as theypleased these were first of wood afterwardsthey tried metal and when they hadmoveable types of metal they next foundthe readiest way of fixing these in framesand of inking and stamping a heavy weightdown upon the paper which was laid overthem there was the printing presswhat was the name of the man whofirst made a printing press said lucythat is disputed too said her mothersome say a man of the name of schemera servant of a dr faustus and some sayfaustus poor dr faustus should be allowedthe glory of the invention as itbrought him into some difficultiesdifficulties how mamma such agreat convenience as the art of printingsaid lucy when he carried a parcel of his printedbibles from germany to paris and offeredthem for sale as manuscripts had formerlybeen sold the french considering thenumber of copies he had made and findingthem all to a letter the same which was adegree of exactness beyond what anythe best copyist could have accomplishedsuspected that he was a wicked magicianand by threatening to pursue him as suchand to burn him they extorted his secretfrom himhow cruel cried lucyhow unjust exclaimed harry iwould never have told it to themi would rather have told it than havebeen burnt alive said lucyit is very happy for us that we do notlive in those days of ignorance said theirmother men are honoured for inventionsnow not persecuted or burnedthat is a blessing said harry butmother how much you know about printingand printers and printing presses andall the history of the invention how couldyou remember it all and have it ready forus the very moment we wanted very easily my dear said his mothersmiling shall i tell you how and whywhen you went with your father thismorning to see the printing press as icould not go with you lying on my sofahere i read an account of printing for iwas determined to be as wise as you bythe time you came backand a great deal wiser mammas saidlucya great deal because you picked outall the things i did not know and wantedto know said harry thank youmotherhis mother asked harry if he had foundout whether there was in bristol any printingpress moved by a steam engine harryanswered that he did not knowyou do not know but did not youvol ii oput your father in mind to inquire saidhis motherno i did not said harrythat is very odd said lucy youwho never forget any thing of that sortit was unlike you indeed harrysaid his mother you were so intent uponit yesterday i recollect your surprise andadmiration when your father told you ofthe double printing press moved by asteam engine which he had seen in londonwhere without hands the types arepressed against the paper and the inkspread just in the quantity required overthe letters and which can in one hourprint sheets on both sides my dearharry is it possible you can have forgottenthis no mother i never said i had forgottenit answered harrythen why did not you put your fatherin mind to inquire whether there was anysuch printing press in bristol when youleft me your head seemed quite full of ityes mother but but what pray tell me for i cannotunderstand your silence my dear said hismotheronly i thought mother that lucywould like better to see the plain commonprinting press first because she said thatshe should like so very much to see exactlywhat is described in the book of tradestherefore i did not ask papa about thesteam double printing press because ithought that would puzzle and hurry herand that she would not see the thing justas she wished and you knows i can seewhat i want another time perhapshow very kind harry said lucyso that was your reason and you didnot forget but you never told me thatyou gave it all up for me if mamma hadnot by accident asked i should never haveknown oh harry why did not you tellmewhat signifies telling or talking aboutit said harry it was nothing butjvist what you would do for me i do noto forget the fairy you gave up for me lucythe other day the new corsican fairya steamboat will set off from bristoltomorrow morning oh father criedharry can you take me to see iti can harry and will with pleasuresaid his father and lucy said harry in a tonewhich showed that his joy great as itwas could not be complete without her and lucy said her father if theday be fine but i cannot take her if itshould rainnext morning harry was up by daybreakpeeping out to see what kind of aday it was likely to be a cloudy morningit was at five o'clock threateningrain desperately between six and seven raining downright between eight andnine and presently it not only rainedbut it poured so that all hope was over forlucy splash splash harry trudgedafter his father through the dirty streetsscarcely hearing not at all heeding therattling of carriages rumbling of cartsrolling of barrels jarring and janglingof iron bars dragged upon diays withoutwheels over rough pavements with allthe indescribable clatter and clangor andclamor and stunning din of this mostnoisy of noisy cities nor did he feel therain which poured over him but whenthe heavy shower ceased and when drippingumbrellas closed and the sun throughthe clouds gave promise of a better dayharry entreated his father to let him runback for lucy if his father would butwait for him five minutes in a shop this bookseller's shop papa i will beback in less than five minutes and i willbring her very quickly and as safe as possiblethrough the streets may i papa no his father said he could not waitfor the vessel would set off punctually atthe appointed hour and if they delayedfive minutes they should be too latethen harry thought they could neverwalk fast enough on he kept beforehis father the rest of the way till theycame to a great crowd of people notonly the lower class of idlers but personsof all ranks assembled to see the departureof the steamboat harry dartedquickly after his father while heads andelbows closed over him he could notsee farther than the backs and legs ofthe people before him for some time buthe pierced through the darkness of thedense crowd of tall bodies and emergedat last from under the elbow of a seacaptain into full daylight hefound himself standing on the stonepierof a large dock at the very edge of thewater in the front row of a multitude ofspectators who covered the quay throughthe buzz of voices the first thing he distinctlyheard was she will not get out this quarter ofan hour she will not get out till thetide lets them open the dockgatesshe as harry knew meant the steamvessel he rejoiced to find that theywere in such good time now he hadleisure to breathe and to look abouthim close beneath the stone pier onwhich he was standing were several vesselsamong which he first distinguishedthe steamboat by the faint grey smokewhich he saw rising from a black ironchimney that stood in the middle of itsdeck the boat had sails but they werenot spread they were close furled as unnecessaryfor the voyage it appeared asif there were fewer sailors on board thanin the other vessels but all was in motionon her deck and on the adjoining piertwo men were rolling a chariot overplanks laid from the pier to the edge ofthe vessel others were dragging to itsright place on the deck another carriage others held horses on the quay who wereto go into the boat and who with earspointed forward and expanded nostrilsdrew back and yet in a few instants patientlysubmitted to their fate while thegentlemen to whom they belonged or theirservants anxiously called out giving directionsabout their valuable and their favouritehorses groups of people with bundlesbaskets boxes bags and umbrellas in theirhands stood by waiting impatiently tillthe horses and carriages were disposed ofand then they stretched their necks andtheir hands and gave in their goods witheager directions to a sailor who balancedon a board scarcely appearing even tolisten to them handed the packages asfast as he received them to another sailorbehind him repeating continually to theanxious proprietors they will all be safe all will betakengood care of sir or madam asthe case might beharry was astonished by the vast weightnumber and bulk of things animate andinanimate which were stowed on boardloads of boxes and parcels and basketstrunks chests or packingcases besides thecarriages and horses and after all passengerscrowding in innumerable allthese to be carried by steam full againstthe wind which was now rising therewas a man in a blue jacket with a largestraw hat on standing near harry hewas a sailor belonging to one of the which lay in the dock andwhich was not likely to sail this day windnot permitting he eyed with no friendlyeye these preparations going forward withsuch alacrity his brow darkened andwith a sulky look he began to whistleone belonoirip to the steamboat whoheard him smiled and said no need to whistle for a fair windwe can oo without a wind or against itprovoked beyond endurance by thisboast the old sailor swore yes i amsorry to say he did swear that for hispart he would not go on board a steamboatfor both the indies and a puncheonof rum into the bargain not he hewould rather in the roughest gale be outat sea in an honest sailing packet witha gale in his teeth than go on boardsuch a thing as this the finest day of theyearthis speech making little impressionupon the bysanders he added that itowas well for her it was fair weather forshe would never stand a galethen shutting one eye and looking upwardswith the other he observed that ifhe was not more mistaken than ever hewas in his days the wind that was risingwould soon blow a storm which wouldbring as he prophesied evil to all whowere going on board heramong the intended passengers whowere standing by was a poor decent lookingwoman in a black bonnet and cloakwith many bundles in one hand andholding by the other a sickly lookinglittle girl the woman listened withgreat anxiety and the child looked exceedinglyfrightened whilst this sailorwas speaking and grew paler and palerwhen he went on telling of the dangerousaccidents he had heard of happeningon board steamboats boilers thathad burst and scalded some to death orblown all on board and the vessel topieces the child on hearing this let goa cocoanut which she had been huggingclose to her bosom and clung with bothher hands to her mother the cocoanutwould have rolled into the water if harryhad not stopped it but he picked it upand returned it to the little girl offeringto put it into a bag which her mother triedto open but her hands trembled so muchthat she could not untie the strings harrydisentangled them for her and begged hernot to be alarmed the sailor persistedin saying that she had good reason to beafraid adding that as her child was somuch frightened and as her own heartfailed her she wouldst much better notto go in the steamboat but to wait tillthe next day and take her place and acomfortable birth in the sailingpacketwhich would be off early in the morningthe poor woman said that she couldnot wait for the morrow and though shestill trembled she tried to speak steadilysaying that her heart did not fail her thatshe was determined to go now and in thesteampacket for it was the cheapest andthe quickest way she could go to hermother who was lying dangerously ill indublin and if she missed this day shemight never see her mother alivethe tears rolled down her cheeks asshe spoke the sailor still urged her not togo and risk drowning her child harrycalled to his father who was talking tosome gentlemen and had not heard whatpassed harry begged his father wouldcome and tell this poor woman whether hethought she might safely go in the steamboator not not only his father but thegentlemen who had been talking to himcame immediately and assured the poorwoman that in their opinion she mightgo with perfect safety one of these gentlemenwas an american he told herthat he had in his own country beenhundreds of times and many thousandmiles in steamboats and had never seenany accident happenharry's father added further to encouragethe poor woman that the two gentlemenwho were speaking to her had themselvestaken their passage on board thisvery packet she thanked them andwiping away her tears said she had beendetermined to go at all hazards but nowshe had no fears the sailor sulkily turnedaway and walked offa call now came for all to go on boardas the tide served and they were justopening the dock gates all hastened onboardexcept the poor woman but themoment she began to move her childscreamed and clinging round her legscried i know it will burst i know itwill burst it will scald me to death itwill kill us oh mother mother do notgo oh mother mother the pooravoman did all she could to soothe herbut in vain the child was so terrified thatit listened to nothing and when its handswere loosened from round its mother'sknees and when she tried to lift it up thelittle girl caught fast hold of harry's armstruggling with all her might a messengercame saying that the captain wouldnot wait the woman again trembled excessivelyand grew paleperhaps father said harry if ioffer to go on board the little girl willcome with me when she sees that i amnot afraidtry said his fatherharry spoke very gently to the childwho stopped crying and listened to himand let him lead her on when she sawthat he was not afraid he thus got herinto the boat to the woman's satisfactionthe child still held fast hold of his handsaying do not leave me do not goi must go said harry and i amvery sorry for it for i should like to stayvery muchhis father who had followed him andwho had learnt that they could go a fewmiles down the river and be put on shoreat a landing place told harry that sincehe wished so much to go he might andthat he would accompany him harrythanked him and was delighted thecrates were now opened and they wereslowly towed out of the dock and betweenthe narrow piers while the swing bridgesturned back were covered with spectatorsa band of music stationed on the deckplayed the sun shone bright and alllooked happy yet harry was a little disappointedby their being towed he toldhis lather that he had thought it was all tobe done by steamwait a few minutes and you will seethat it will be so said the captain smilingas soon as the vessel had reached theriver and passed the place where a ferryboatwas crossing the smoke from thechimney issued thicker and thicker andspread like a gigantic pennon over theirheads the towing had ceased the paddlewheels were set in motion andnow my boy said the captain we aregoing by steam and easily and swiftlythey went gliding rapidly on between highhills and rocks on both sides of themthe lofty crescents terraces and hanginggardens of clifton seemed to fly back asthey passed in a few seconds the ferryboatlessened and vanished they passedthe majestic rock of st vincent crownedwith specks of human figures birds hoveredround their nests in the rock asthey passed on the captain pointed toleigh woods and nightingale valley but scarcely had he named them whennew scenes were before them harryfelt afraid that they were going tooswiftly and that his pleasure would toosoon be at an end he had neverstirred from the spot where he stoodwhen he had first entered the boat thechild having fast hold of his fore fingerhad by this time lulled by the music andthe easy motion fallen fast asleep with herhead in her mother's lap harry longedto go to his father who was walking upand down the deck with the captainand the american gentleman talking asheheard every now and then as theypassed him of something entertaining aboutsteam boats but he thought he couldnot draw his finger away from the childwithout wakening it and the mother lookedup piteously in his face once when heoffered to move saying this is the first sleep she has had thesethree nights she has been very illtry if you can put in your finger insteadof mine whispered harry and gentlyunclosing the hand of the sleepingchild he drew out his and the motherslipped in hers the hand closed againthe child did not waken the mother smiledand harry set free ran off joyfully to hisfather he found the gentlemen wereeagerly claiming for their several nationsthe honour of bringing into general usethe invention of the steam vesselthe captain who was a scotchmanclaimed it for the men of glasgow theamerican maintained that the number ofsteam boats in america and the years theyhad been there in use proved that they hadfirst felt the value of the invention thiscould not be denied the scotchman admittedbut it must never be forgotten thatthe first was sent out to america from glasgowand that a scotchman went out withit and that the engine was one of boltonand watt's without this it could neverhave been set agoingan irish gentleman here begged leaveto remark that the experiment of the lastwinter's trial of them between dublin andholyhead had been undeniably the mostfair and satisfactory ever made and hadestablished steam vessels in the three kingdomsan englishman who was presentand who was silent till the last said onlythat he was content since none could doubtthe original invention was english and thewhole establishment of this glorious anduseful discovery in europe was exclusivelybritish harry's father to whom he appealedhad the candour to mention afrench gentleman who many years agotried an experiment with a steam boat onthe rhone at lyons by listening to allthat was said harry learned in short thehistory of this invention it was firstthought of nearly a hundred years ago bya mr hull for towing vessels in and outthe marquis de jouflfroyiof harbours but he only made the proposalnot the attempt and he had no idea ofusing it in any other manner the firstperson who actually placed a steam enginein a boat and tried the experiment was amr patrick miller at glasgow the remainsof the boat are yet in being and thescotch gentleman said he had lately seenthem several persons in scotland andengland about this time proposed to employsteam vessels but they did not comeinto general use till a model of one wascarried from glasgow to america itssuccessful establishment in that countryon the prodigiously extensive lakes andrivers of the new world proved its practicabilityand brought it at last into use inscotland england and irelandharry was surprised to hear that a hundredyears should have passed between thefirst invention and its beings brought intogeneral use and asked why it had not succeededat first as well as at last severalreasons were given the scotch captainsaid that vessels were not originally madestrong enough that the improvementslately adopted in ship building had renderedit possible to employ a greater powerof steam than they could formerly withoutdanger of destroying the vessel theenglishman observed that people had beenfor many years too much occupied in applyingthe steam engine to other purposesin england to think of adapting it toboats and indeed it was scarcely necessarytill now that commerce has increasedso rapidly and the goods and people tobe carried on canals rivers and sea areso numerousharry was much obliged to the gentlemenwho took the trouble to give these explanationsin reply to the question he hadasked and felt a little proud of beingtreated so much like a reasonable personhe took care not to interrupt them withmore questions though there vivere manyhe wished to ask but at the first pausehe whispered to his father and asked whetherit was possible for him to see themachinery of this steam vessel he couldnot see the paddlewheels of which he hadheard the captain speaking he wishedvery much to understand how these weremoved by the steam engine and how theyworked the ship forward so rapidly andpowerfully against the wind which nowblew strong his father told him that hecould not show him the machinery whilethey were going on but he would ask thecaptain to show it to him whenever theystopped which they were soon to do at aplace called lamplighter's hall thiswas now in sight and in a few minutesthey reached it and harry heard an increasedsound of the rushing of the steamwhich was let out before the vessel couldbe stopped the noise of the working ofthe machinery ceased the vessel stood stilland a rope was made fast to the shore someof the passengers were to be set down hereand others taken up and during the delaythis occasioned the captain had time toattend to harry's request he was a goodnaturedman and took pleasure in gratifyingas he said the boy's laudable curiosityhe showed him how the engine is connectedwith the paddlewheels theylooked something like the waterwheels ofa mill and as they turned and as eachvane struck upon the water he perceivedthat it urged on the boat like the oars ofthe boatmen whom he had seen rowinghe asked at what rate they had been movingtoday and was told about eightmiles and a half an hour they hadbeen going against the wind but with thestream he asked what is the fastest rateat which steam vessels can go and wastold by the american gentleman elevenmiles an hour but in england as the englishgentleman said ten miles an hourthe irish gentleman asserted that duringthe last two years the passage from dublinto holyhead had always been performedat an average rate of about seven miles anhour and that the mail which was carriedby the steam packets had scarcelymissed a day even in the most stormyweather he asked harry if he hadsuffered from sea sickness harry hadnever been in a ship and had never beensick in a boat the river had been socalm to day that they had scarcely felt themotion of the vesselwell some time or other you will feelwhat it is and then you will be thankful tothe steam packet which at least lessensthe time of the suffering and affords thecertainty that it will be over in a givennumber of hoursharry listened to his father and thesegentlemen who spoke of the great advantagesto commerce and to society from thisquick communication between distant countriesenlarged views opened upon hisyoung intelligent mind and he exclaimed what a grand invention i am glad itwas made by efigiishmeji he was going to saps britonshe did say which word satisfying thescotch the irish and the englishmanthey all smiled upon him pray young gentleman what do youthink of us americans said the americanwe have done more than any of you iguess recollect that we have at theleast three hundred steam boats in constantuse three hundred said harry with atone of admiration but recollectadded he that it is by our help that youhave all these you know we sent thefirst model to americawe scotch interposed the scotchmanin a low voicethat model helped i acknowledgesaid the americanthen added harry if we helpedyou in the beginning you that have a wholenew world to yourselves will help us inthe end i hopeall fair and i hope we shall so shakehands said the american shaking harryheartily by the hand for one i promiseyou if ever you come to americamy little man i will make you heartilywelcome and if you please you shall goin a steam boat on the mississipi andmissouri and on the ohio some thousandsof miles that would please youi guess i am sure it would said harrygratitude to these kind gentlemen andthe enthusiasm which had been excited inharry's mind quite overcoming his habitualtaciturnity he went on talking of thisglorious invention after a hundredyears working at it it is at last said he brought to perfectionperfection repeated his fatherharry that is saying too muchtoo much for any human inventionsir said the scotchman and as weknow even at present there is much moreto be done for these steam vesselsand much is doing continued harry'sfather men of science and genius aregoing on continually making improvementsjust before i left london said theenglishman i heard of a number of capitalimprovements preparing for our steamvol ii pboats which will make them more durableand safer than they are at presentthe american nodded with an air ofgreat satisfaction and some mysterycan the steam boats be made saferthan they are said harrysince accidents have happened said thecaptain they may happen again butmany that have will hardly occur againwe shall guard against them in futuremay i ask sir said harry very respectfully might i ask what was thecause of those accidents and how youguard against them nowyou may ask and welcome my eagerlittle man said the captain with a goodhumouredsmile but i cannot undertaketo answer you all this at once or atany time certainly not now my dearlittle fellow added he looking at hiswatch for i must be off so goodbyeto youthe poor woman with her child stoodclose to the place where harry must passwhen he was to land with a gratefulsmile she said to him as he came nearmaster my child here is a deal thebetter for that sweet sleep she had thanksto you for itpleased yet ashamed to have this saidto him in the hearing of several peoplewho were standing by harry coloured uptothe ears and answered in a blunt mannerand in a rude tone do not thank me for nothings i didnothing at allthe child running before him so asto stop him as he would have pushed onheld up her cocoa nut and said i will give you this take it dooh no i cannot take it from yousaid harry but thank you thank youthe child still held up the cocoa nutand harry seeing that she looked vexedby his refusal took it from her hands andturning back rolled it along the deckp run after it run said he andthank you as much as if i had it goodbyethe child ran after the rolling ball andharry sprung from the boat on shorea chaise was procured at lamplighter'shall an inn near the landing place andhis father and he were now to go in itback to clifton harry's head was sofull of the steam boat that he couldthink and talk of nothing else all theway father among other advantages whichsteam boats have over carriages with horsesand men there is this great one that thesteam engines neither eat nor drink norsleep and steam never grows tired buthorses and men must rest sometimesi wish you would rest now harry alittle said his father and do not kickmy shins in your transportsi beg your pardon said harrybut father i do not see why a steamboatshould not go on for weeks andmonths just as well as for hours and dayssurely it can go as long as there is fire andas lonof as there is water cannot itsurely as long as we can supply theengine with fuel and the boiler with waterand as long as the machinery does notbreakthen if they make the whole strongenough said harry why should notpeople cross the great ocean from englandto america as well as the little sea fromengland to ireland why not father what is the difficulty you look as ifthere were some impossibility no harry not an impossibility butthere is a difficulty and a great difficultysaid his father and if you consider youwill perceive what it isharry considered but he did not findit out his mind was too much exalted he was too full of the noble steam boat tobe able to think with his usual degree ofattentionhis father helped him a little to settlehis thoughts and brought him to considerthe time which would be requisite for thisvoyage to americait takes about three weeks harrywhat would be absolutely necessary tothe steam boat to enable it to stay outat sea all that time and to perform itsvoyagefire water men that is all saidharry except provisions the usualthings which are carried for long voyageswe may take for granted are carriedtrue but there is something whichyou have not yet named that is essentialsaid his father by essential i mean thatwithout which the thing cannot befire water men men fire waterrepeated harry i can think of nothingelse which you could say is essential iheed not say men even one man couldregulate the engine i believewhat do you mean by regulate theengine said his father i mean said harry he can supplythe boiler with water and the fire withfuel fuel aye now i see what novimean father fuel there must be to keepup the fire to boil the water to make thesteam so coals must be carried or woodand great quantities but their weight weneed not mind on the water and with thatpower of steam you know father i know son but what will you doabout the bulk coals or wood or whateverfuel be put on board your steam boatmust take up space calculate howmuchafter o'oino through a calculation whichneed not be here repeated harry groaned and acknowledged that unless the steamboatwere many times larger than anythat had ever been made it could notafford space for the necessary quantity offuelbut why argued he should not avessel be made several times larger thanany we have seen a moment's reflection showed iiithat such increased bulk would require increasedstrength to keep it together andthat again must bring increase of weightand difficulty of managing the wholestill said harry though there isthis great difficulty about carrying thefuel we should not give it up should wefather perhaps some of those ingeniousmen who first thought of steam boats ahundred years ago or even fifty yearsago imagined they should never succeedand they were laughed at were notthey because they did not succeed at firstyet now oh if they were alive now and could see what their invention hascome to the admiration of the wholeworld therefore father i think peopleshould not mind being laughed at whenthey know they are right and they shouldnot be stopped in their great discoveries bylittle difficulties or great difficulties or anysort of difficulties but still go on tryingexperiments and inventing till they cometo some impossibility and then they mustbe quiet but not till then they need notgive up and they should not cried harryright right my dear boy said hisfather i am glad to see this spiritrising in you harry was silent for a mile or twoand then exclaimed father i am so glad you have nobook this morning to read in the carriagebecause you have time to talk to me tellme what accidents happened formerly inthe steam boats and how do peopleprevent them now as the captain said theycan fthe principal accidents and the mostdangerous replied his father have beenthe bursting of the boilers if i recollectrightly one which burst in an americanvessel killed several people and blew theboat to pieces another which burst inengland scalded to death the persons inthe cabin who were near itthe sailor spoke truth then saidharry to that poor woman this morningthough i did not believe him he advisedher not to go on board the steam boat becausehe said that many such accidentshave happened and happen very oftenp there he was wrong said harry'sfather because he exaggerated butfew have occurred we have accounts ofthem all and can therefore judge andspeak positivelyi am glad of it very very gladcried harry now father about theways of preventing them in future willyou tell me thatfirst lei me harry do you know thedifference between what is called malleableor ivroueht iion and cast iron you sawboth and the difference was explained toyou when we were at the founderi recollect it father replied harry cast iron is i believe that which hasbeen melted and made to run into the formin which it is to be used malleable orbrought iron is that which is hammeredwhen it is heated into the shape whateverit may be that is requiredsince you know this much harry ican ofo on said his father it has beenfound by many trials that hammered orwrought iron is stronger than cast iron and better able to resist the expansive forceof steam those boilers of steam engineswhich burst were in almost all instancesmade of cast iron others of wroughtiron have also in some cases givenway but even when they have they havenot exploded violently so as to do mischiefthey have rent asunder andopened so as to let out the steam inconsequenceof this experience boilers arenow generally made of wrought iron thisis one cause of increased safetyand a great one said harryanother step in improvement andsafety has been made continued his father by experience having proved to usthat though copper is rapidly destroyed byalternate heating and cooling it is moredurable than iron for boilers of steam vesselsat seacopper stronger than iron fathercried harry i should never have thoughtit was you do not repeat with your usual exactnesswhat i told you said his fatheri did not assert that copper is in all circumstancesand for all purposes strongerand more durable than iron i said thatit has been found to be more durablewhen used as the boiler of a steam engineat seaat sea repeated harry fatheri know that you have some particular reasonfor being so careful in the words ofwhat you say and in that emphasis youlaid upon sea find out my reason then said his fatherperhaps said harry there may besomething in sea water which rusts ironand so destroys it and perhaps that whateverit may be does not rust and destroycopperjust so harry but what is thatsomething you are acquainted with itsaid his fatheris it sea salt said harry which isin the water yes harry a chemist has lately triedexperiments which have ascertained thisfact and in consequence of these experimentsit has been decided that infuture the boilers should be made ofcopperhow useful it is to try experiments said harry that settles what is truthand there is no more doubting or disputingthat chemist was a sensiblemanand here is another large instanceharry said his father in which chemistryhas assisted the mechanictrue father said harry but thereis another question i want to ask you aboutthe paddle wheels what were the improvementsin them of which those gentlemenwere talking i cannot explain them to you harrysaid his father because you do notknow distinctly the difficulties and thefaults in the present construction and thesei cannot now describe to you you shouldfirst see them in action in the waterand how and when can i do that said harrynot now when we are going in acarriage on land said his father laughingbut some time or other we may be in aboat within view of a steam vesselharry sighing repeated some timeor other is there any other great improvementyou could explain to mehis father yawned and said he beganto be weary of his questionsonly one thing more i have to saysaid harry and you need not answerthe steam engine i saw this morning inthe boat takes up a great deal of room ifit could be made to do as well in a smallercompass what a great improvement howcomfortable it would be said harrytrue said his father and howcomfortable it would be to me if you wouldlet me rest now poor father so i will thank youi have quite tired you no harry but i did not sleep welllast night i drank too strong tea orcoffeehis father went to sleep and harry satas still as a mouse lest he should wakenhim how tea or coffee could keep peopleawake he did not know he pondered longon that subject but was never the wiser he had never yet been kept awake byeither when the carriage stopped andnot till then his father wakened quite refreshedwhen they got out their postillion beggedharry to stay a minute while hefumbled for something in the side pocketsand then in the front pocket of the carriageit was here it should be here theytold me it was here muttered the postillionwhile he continued his search withhis legs out and his body in the chaise at last in the sword case he found what hehad been told was there and he broughtout the cocoa nut which he put intoharry's hands telling him that a sailorcharged him not to forget it he saidthat a mother and child sent it to him and the message was that it mightmake him a cup some time or other andhad good milk in it if he could get itoutthe postillion was anxious to deliverthis message correctly for he said heknew the woman who had been alwaysvery kind to himlucy who had been looking out of thewindow of the inn watching for their returnheard what passed and saw thecocoa nut with joy she ran to meetharry and to learn from him who gave itto him and to hear an account of his adventuresthese he told with all the detailsshe desired till he came to the momentof the woman's crossing his passageas he left the boat then pausing andturning his cocoa nut about in every directionhe said he was ashamed to tell herhow crossly he had spokenhis father added yes harry you areriofht to be ashamed i was ashamed foryoui wonder you did not tell me so at thetime father said harryi knew it would not do you any goodat the moment i thought you would recollectit afterwards yourself as i find youdo and i hope the pain you now feel willprevent you from doing the same sort ofthing again i hope it will said harry but whenthat kind of feeling comes over me it is sodisagreeable i do not know what i am doingor saying and i am angry with myselfand with the people who speak tomeand with every body but the painof reproaching myself afterwards withhaving been illnatured is worse still as ifeel now and i shall remember this and iwill try and conquer myself next time i am sure you will try and i am sureyou will do it said lucytake the cocoa nut said harry puttingit into her hands we will notopen it yet pack it up somewhere forme men always talk of packing up a thingsomewheres thought lucy and womenare to find whereit required lucy's best powers of packingto find a somewhere for the cocoa nut but she did at last stow it into the carpetbagcontrary to the prophecies of all beholderswhen they were leaving bristol theystopped at a bookseller's to buy some bookor books to read in the carriage severalworks were spread upon the counter in thebookseller's shop for them to take theirchoice harry and lucy read the titlepages of some which their father and motherallowed them to look overwe will dip here and there in thebooks said harry and see whether theylook entertaining may we papa may we cut the leaves said lucypeeping between two uncut pagesthe showman with some hesitationpresented an ivory cutter to her telling herthat she was welcome to cut the leaves ifshe would be so good as to take care not totear them he became at ease when hesaw her set about the operation perceivingshewas used to it and dextrous butcare sat on the bookseller's brow consideratewhen harry took up the ivoryknife he thought that he would tear awaylike most other boys that he had seenwithout heeding what mischief they didif i make the least jag i will stopand show it you sir you may dependupon that said harry proudly you may trust to our honour whoeverjags first stopsvery well said their father lookingup from the book he was reading uponthat condition you may cut awaythey were glad to see their father andmother both caught by some new booksitting down to read we shall havegood time said they to cut and dipafter each cutting half a volume theyshowed the adores of the books not theslightest indenture appeared that couldby the most exact bookseller's eye be accountedajv all was smooth and faireven to the inmost recess of the dangerouscorner of the quadruple page now we have cut enough said lucy let us dip three times harry and catchwhat we mayharry seized upon one of the books andopened upon this passage which he readaloud as the gloomy habitation my grandfather wasin was not to be long endured but from necessitythey were

entertainyouthank you mamma harry are notyou glad we are to have this book saidlucy hey harry bnt harry made no answer he was intentupon a passage in another bookwhich he had just opened what is it said lucy looking overhis shoulder oh i see the word steamengine that is enough for him but nowharry do not choose a stupid bookno danger of that miss this isone of the scotch novels said the shopman a novel harry said lucy howdid a steam engine get into it i do not know said harry but iknow that i have found a fine characterof i will not tell you but you shall hearit father would you be so kind as toread it out to my mother and lucy why should not you be so kindharry as to read it to them yourselfsaid his fatherbecause father i cannot do justice toitsaid harry and it is so good that icould not bear to spoil it pray fatherread it here is the bookhis father read the following characterof the great inventor of the steam enfine amidst this company stood mr watt the manwhose genius discovered the means of multiplying ournational resources to a degree perhaps even beyondhis own stupendous powers of calculation and combination bringing the treasures of the abyss to thesummit of the earth giving the feeble arm of manthe momentum of the afrite commanding manufacturesto arise as the rod of the prophet producedwater in the desert affording the means of dispensingwith that time and tide which wait for no man andof sailing without that wind which defied the commandsand threats of xerxes himself this potent commanderof the elements this abridger of time andspace this magician whose cloudy machinery hasproduced a change in the world the effects of whichextraordinary as they are perhaps are only now beginningto be felt was not only the most refinedman of science the most successful combined ofpowers and calculator of numbers as adapted topractical purposes was not only one of the mostgenerally well informed but one of the best andkindest of human beings several gentlemen who had been readinglaid down their books to listen to thiseloquent and just eulogium when itwas finished and when the reader's voicestopped there was silence for a momentthen a general burst of admirationwho wrote it where is it whoseis itall crowded round harry to look at thebook harry felt proud of having foundout ybr himself and by himself what was good it is scarcely necessary to say thathis father bought the work the parcelwas made up put into the carriage andthey drove on as soon as they were outof the noisy streets harry and lucy seizedagain upon this book eager to know if therewas any thing more in it about mr wattthey found an account of his powers ofpleasing in conversation and of his greatvariety of knowledgethis struck harry with fresh admiration how i wish papa had known him cried lucy oh harry if you hadbut seen him should not you have likedit very much i should not have cared for merelyseeing him said harry unless i couldhave heard him and known himthey now began to question each otherwhich of all the great people of whomthey had ever heard or read they shouldmost wish to have seen and known andthen which they should have liked onlyjust to see which to have for acquaintvolii qonce which for friends and which theyshould like to live with always these questions brought on a great dealof interesting and diverting discussionduring which papa and mamma were oftenappealed to and in which they took theirshare much to harry and lucy's delightthe number of those with whom theyshould choose to live which at first wasprodigious on lucy's part especially wasgradually reduced till at last it came downto very few indeed not above five orsixit was observed that harry who informertimes desired to see only greatmechanics now desired to know greatchemists too and all sorts of sensible andinventing people as he saidthis was one good consequence as lucyremarked of their having lately travelledso much but tomorrow harry continuedshe is to be the last day's travellingare you glad or sorry harry i donot know which i am myself partly gladpartly sorry t feel sorry that the journeywill be at an end because i like travellingvery much and seeing every day somenew and entertaining things and peoplebut i shall be glad for one great reason tocome to the end of our journey that wemay see the cottage by the seaside ilong to know what sort of a looking cottageit is do not you harryyes said harry but above all iwish to sea the oceanand the sea shore cried lucy where i may pick up hundreds ofshells and i hope i shall see ships saidharry and a boat with sails in which wemay sail sometimes said lucyyes i should like that very muchsaid harrv i want to know more aboutsails shoulder of mutton sails especiallycried lucy which i remember readingabout in robinson crusoe i wonder whatthey are her father sketched for her a shoulderof mutton sail and she was rather disappointedwhen she learned that the namearose merely from the shapethe conversation was interrupted by thesight of a boat on a river but it had nosails it was a ferry boatat harry and lucy's age it was a real pleasureto cross a ferry though to travellersmore advanced in
