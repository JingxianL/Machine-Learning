whohad come from the mainland that macdonaldwas then tit inverlochy with his kith kinand allies having retiuned thither from anexpedition which he had taken to avenge thefate of his old friend duke

having received the king's clement permissionto return home unmolested he arrivedand where to shew how resolute he wasto set at nought the royal authority the firstthing he did was to burn the town and laysiege to the castlenow it had so chanced that the lady sibillby the exhortations of her aunt thediscreet countess of boss with the arterysolicitations of her royal mistress about thistime came back to the court and was thenabiding with the queen in the abbey ofholyrood at edinburgh where in the judgmentof all the gallants her beauty albeitfaded in its virgin bloom had received newlustre by

which he administeredas it were with the left hand to the weak sideof her vanitiessibilla however heeded not the fond admirationwith which she was followed butabandoned herself to bitter ruminations onthe disappointment of her early affection andthe ruined fortunes of her first lover forthough she shunned not the pastimes of thecourt yet was her spirit amidst the most joyfulrevels ever far away and her eyes wanderedwith a cold and aimless restlessnessthat often touched the observer with the sympathyof a melancholy wonder and sorrowshe had plainly no pleasure in any kind ofcompanionship but as often as she could the spaewifepass forth unheeded she chose her solitarywalks among the lonely places of the neighbouringmountain sitting sometimes on theperilous brink of the precipices like the

looked quickly round andon seeing his majesty gathered up her robeabruptly and darted away the spaewifbchap iiiwhen the king saw that the lady sibilladesired to avoid his presence he abated hisspeed and walked leisurely towards stuartwho at the same time advanced to meethint i should said his majesty it a gravebut jocular manner have laid my interdictat this time on our fair and eloquent cousin for i doubt not that if she is permitted to beatlarge among our friends she will achieveas good as a victory for her father before wemarch but stuart as i doubt not somesuch event was the endeavour of her discoursewith you i shall not repine if on conditionsyou submit to abide her prisoner i have now no hope replied stuartthat she will ever consent to be minethe paewife show said the king what newthing has come to pass to make you thinkit is not in my power to show by anyact or deed that my proffered affection is ofthat purity which the cruelty of ladies in thesetimes requires to be avouched by proof andsacrifice the time was as i have heard saythat ladies were to be won by the gentle sympathyof heavennspired love but the ladysibilla would inflict testslet her have none cousin replied theking for if she be such a bargainer beshrewme if she is worth the having but truly oflate she hath been an altered creature in herdemeanour and no more like the gay andblooming rose she once was than the root is likethe flower and his majesty added with aslight inflection of sadness in his voice plied the ein as if he ponderedijwhimithe spaewife self i alone have a right to your servicesand if it stand with my pleasure and convenienceto say you shall abide here i seenot what cause ether honour knighthoodpropinquity or loyalty have to remonstrateagainst your obedience to the commands it is rumoured that the lord james ofalbany is with macdonald said stuartwhat then what of that i shouldthink it a reason why you ought the more toremain with sibiua as her affection for him isthe greatest impediment to your suiti doubts replied stuart if it is somuch her affection as her ambition and it isthat which makes me despair of ever succeedingbut just now she plainly told me that sheconsidered him dearer than ever since by thefate of his father and brothers he stood somuch nearer to the crown can she be so sordid exclaimed theking then is there no faithful love in womankind for of all ladies i have ever seen the spaewifei did think sibilla macdonald the most romanticin her attachment besides his sentenceof outlawry and forfeiture has cut himoff from the succession but how is it thatall of you seem so to count upon an early deathfor me is not our turbulent cousin mysenior and surely am not so much olderthan yourself stuart that yoii should bereckoned my successor to say nothing of thepresent maternal condition of the queenr his majesty said this in a sharp objurgatorymanner then speedily recovering his wontedurbanity he added but after all stuartnot to make too much ado about who shallhave his head bound with a wreath of briersas this very conversation of ours sufficientlyshows the crown to be i think you ought toremain if love be not the entire sentimentthat binds sibilla to the outlaw we can hardlyquestion that ambition is not the sole motivewhich makes her father espouse his fortunesand therefore were you to remainthe spaewif behind upon the pretext and plea of yourdevotichi to sibilla perhaps out of the policyof that device some way might be found soto work on the avarice of macdonald as tomake him abandon our guilty cousin to hisown destiny without therefore enteringmore curiously into your particular case ilay my commands upon you to abide herewiththe queen and her ladies and it shall bemade known that i have done so because ofyour love and devotion for the daughter ofthe rebellious chieftain things as familiar asscandal to every tongue in the courtstuart would have a second time solicitedhis majesty not so to restrain him from takingthe field albeit in his heart none dissatisfiedthat he had been so peremptory butthe king said with a smile honour knighthoodpropinquity and loyalty must nowhush their remonstrances and prove themselvesthe soldiers and vassals of obedienceyour post and duty in the war is here in the paewifeholyroodhouse and with these words heparted from him leaving him in the middle ofthe gallery where he stood ruminating forsome time in which situation he was found bythe earl of athos as that nobleman came withsir william chrichton and others in theeings confidence to attend the councilwhat has befallen you said the earlto him pausing as he passed leaning on thearm of sir william chrichton the otherswith them passing on to the councilhamberhis majesty replied stuart has dealtunkindly by me he denies me the honourof going with him against macdonald andenjoins me to remain herethe earl of athos somewhat surprised tohear this dropped his hold of the chancellorsarm as he said why has his majesty done so did heassign no reason sir william chrichton looked observantthe spaswife at the earl while he said this forster was adegree of haste and anxiety in the manner ofhis question which struck hidot both as strangeand angular he thinks replied stuart that consideringhow openly i have professed myselfto the lady sibilla it would not accord wellwith that profession to be engaged in adventuresof warfare anst her father then it was not said the earl interruptinghim out of respect to the relationshipin which you stand to the succession pi doubt not interposed sir williamchrichton that his majesty has determinedwisely in this matter though he may not havebeen governed by any regard to the successorsespecially as the queen has declaredherself in the honoured condition of increasingtheir happiness how r exclaimed the earl with a lookinwhich there was much of the eagerness ofalarm is it as you say when did the queen the spaewifeannounce it i have not heard of it beforeit surprises me to hear at this time of suchan eventsthe king himself told mess said stuartthen it is true replied the earl addressinghimself to sir william chrichton why should an occurrence so

robertstuart having remained at the court becauseof the marriage which his majesty hadsettled to take place between him and thelady sibillathere when he entered he found macdonaldand the lord james in an eager and sharpthe spaewifk controversy the lord of the isles beingseemingly much moved and disturbed by thereport of the great force which the king wasbringing against them while the

valleyit was even so for when the lord jameswent back to the camp he was informed thatthe chieftain had set off alone to throw himselfon the eings mercy and he found allthe clansmen preparing to retire to their respectiveregions in the isles and among thehills thus were his hopes again blastedwhile the anguish caused by the constancy ofhis ill fortune was sharpened by the thoughtof sibillas broken faith meanwhile sirrobert gramme pursuing his course southwardparted from the spaewife who ashernature led wandered purposeless away the sfaewibechap vimany things were in the meantime growingto fruit at the court where the lady sibillon parting from stuart in the galleryas set forth went straight to her aunt thecountess of ross and told her that untilher father's enterprise was resolved anddetermined she would give no farther tendanceon the queen in vain did that discreetlady exhort her to the contrary and representthat by being in companionship withher majesty she might find means and opportunitiesto mitigate the kings ire butsibilla was not to be moved by any stress ofelocution so that she continued to abide withthe countess while the royal preparations forthe suppression of the rebellious raid were inthe spaewife process seldom appearing abroad but in a sequestratedand lately mannerit came however to pass that the kingbeing instructed how none of the great baronsand chiefs of the north of whose clans andpreparations he stood most in apprehensionhad joined the rebels but that in many partswhere the lord james and macdonald countedon friends the only

the bastardprogeny of elizabeth mure and defraudedthe lawful issue of king robert the secondof their birthright stuart was amazed to hear her speak soboldly and her taunts entered into theqjliick of his soul for he had ever felt ashis uncle the earl of athos felt that theposthumous law of the succession was agrievous injury to all the descendants ofthe marriage with euphemia of rosswhich marriage till the enactment of thelaw had been accounted the only lawfulmatrimony which that king had really contractednotwithstanding the general commiserationwith which the fate of the fair elizabethmure had been lamented he stood inconsequencesome time struck with wonderwhich sibilla perceiving added scornfully the spaewife i doubt not there is treason in my wordsmy father and my betrothed husband arein rebellion why should not i too think andfeel as a rebel but go complete the loyaltyof tamely submitting to be shut out fromyour own rights by accusing me of treasonwhy man if you had half the manhood that sin the left hand of your unfortunate cousinthe earl of athos would long ere now havebeen king and yourself the heir to the thronesstuart trembled to see that the lady sibillawhile she thus spoke was pale and dreadfulher eyes flashing fire and the beauty of hercountenance haggard with rage and contempti pray you sweetest lady said he softly let not such perilous thoughts escapeyou why should the earl of athos or myselfshake the kingdom from its proprietywith such old stories seeing that we areplaced by providence despite all human contrivanceto the contrary so very near thethronethe

smitten deedsshew the man and i esteem you by what youhave proved yourself the only daring thingyou have ever done has been to offer yourselfto me as the rival of your brave kinsman andthat very prudently my lord has beenmost valorously adventured behind his backsstuart felt as if his passion was entirelyquenched and he gazed at the flashing frenzyof her eye and tle haggard energy of hercolourless cheek and quivering lip with almostirrepressible aversion but the femininefit was spent and while he stood contemplatingher with astonishment and marvellingthat he should ever have thought her lovelyor deserving to be loved the gentle spirit ofher nature returned and she sat down andbegan to weepthe spabwife the sadness of her voice and the soft solicitationwith which her eloquent eyes aidedthe wish that he woidd desist from his importunatedevotion renewed with redoubledtenderness the admiration which she had solong inspired but the firmness with whichshe declared her determination to accept onlythe lord james taught him that his passionwas without hope twice he essayed tospeak and to tell her something of the emotionswherewith his bosom was agitated buthis tongue could find no words and he quittedher presence torn with the conflicts of rejectedlove contemned manhood baffled desiresand protestations scornedin the whirlwind of this storm within hehurried to the kings chamber to ask that hemight have leave to quit the court never toreturn while sibilla was there but in goingthither he saw a great concourse of people assembledat the gate the guards and halberdand archers all drawn out on hastily the spawifinquiring what had chanced a confused responseby many tongues informed him thatthe lord of the isles had suddenly appearedbefore the king while his majesty was at hisorisons in the chapelsome said he had attemptedthe kings lifeand all agreed thathe had been seized on the spot and was thenin the abbeyso strange an accident made him at themoment forget his own cares and rushingthrough the guards he ascended the stairs tolearn the circumstances of so singular an occurrenceas that the rebel should in such aplace and at such a time have presentedhimself before the kingthe spaewife chap viiwhen stuart came into the eings presencehis majesty was walking to and fro in thechamber plainly in great molestation of mind and the queen was standing apart by herselfin the bower window seemingly deterred frombreaking in upon his cogitations by the violentbattle of thought wherewith he was agitatedon observing them in this state stuartwould have retired but he perceived that onhis entrance the king had glanced his eye towardshim so that he was in a manner constrainedto remain and while he stood at thedoor sir william chrichton with others ofthe council came in upon whose appearancehis majesty mastered his feelings and resumedhis natural equanimity sir williams said the king on seeing the the spaewifechancellor i

sufficientlyverifies we had given him permissionto return unmolested home and to abidein his island in peace but no sooner did anoccasion arise whereby he thought to advancehimself reckless of the damage he mightcause to others than he again took the fieldbut he has placed himself defenceless in mypower and truly i pray heaven to instructme what i ought to do that my honour maybesafe and the commonweal protectedthe chancellor went respectfully up to theking and said macdonald in so casting himself into thehands of your majesty if we may judge byhis heretofore actions has not done so fromthat nobility of motive which entitles him toappeal to the judicature of honour but hasthe spaewife been compelled by some constraint of circumstancewhich he could not master or is actuatedby what with him is a no less forcibleargument some view of advantage in eithercase he merits but the same treatment andthe law and the commonweal claim the firstconsiderations i know au that's replied the king quicklyi discern all that but then he hasthrown himself into my own hands and i amforced to consider not only what as a king imust do but likewise what to preserve myknighthood unstained i ought

supinenessin being restrained from vindicatinghis birthright by the false loyalty he hadlearnt from the earl of athos did he continueto pace the chamber for a season andever and anon he rejoiced that

struggles did not last long for ever and anon his evil angel would comeupon him and nerve him with pride makinghis age seem less and brightening his countenancewith a royal arrogance which soonhowever changed into a dark and cruel lookthe spaewifb then he would stalk hurriedly and stealthilyacross the room holding his hand as if hegrasped a murderous knife but in thathideous attitude the fiend was

heartwhich is of a keener pang than the anguish ofwounds by the reported inconstancy of thelady sibillain the morning when he saw the clansmenof the isles departing homeward and all thearray that had come to maintain his causemelting away he stood alone on the side ofcraig patrick and meditating on the eclipseof his father's house resolved to leave thescottish strand for ever and to sail to theisle of rhodes there to seek admission intothe brotherhood of the knights of st johnand it chanced that while he was in this the paewifeforlorn and disconsolate state celestine ofloch aw a kinsman of his own suddenly appearedcoming from the bottom of the hillthe mother of this celestine being thedaughter of the regent robert was aunt tothe outlaw and her son had inherited from herthe partialities and affections oi the albanies but his father sir duncan campbell was awarrior of renowned loyalty and in all thingsa firm upholder of the kings administrationit chanced that when the tidings of the lordjames arrival at inverlochy from irelandreached celestine that he was hunting the reddeer on ben clachan with but a few followers and on the pretext of still pursuingthe chase he passed the mountains at thehead of loch ranch and stirring the countryto the north of loch erich had only thatmorning come from dalwhinnie to the campso that the lord james on being told hisname though he joined hands with him as akinsman knew not in what way his affectionsthe pabwfe leant and he was the more disposed to distrusthim seeing him alone and in the garb ofa hunter because of the notour devotion tothe king which his father sir duncan campbellcherished he would therefore havegladly avoided him but the melancholiamanner in which celestine had seen him standingalone leaning on the hilt of his broadswordmuch moved the young chieftain ofthe campbellss and he not only tried to cheerhim with many exhortations to constancy ofmind but with anticipations of better chancesin the affection of undivulged friendsi see not said he your condition in sodismal a plight come with me to kilchumcastle for my father is now with the king atedinburgh there as you aie unknownyou may for a time abide in security till wehear what good fortune is yet in store foryoubut the lord james replied how mayi trust myself in the hands of the campbellsswikappearance these werau the tram that cedestine hath with him and'he briefly told themthe spaewife how they were to comport themselves towardsthe prince sto die in his defence and to putto death whomever they suspected of meditatingany wrong against himthey made no response but looked at thelord james and then each taking the otherby the hand they enclosed him around therebyintimating that they were as one and assuch would defend himthe cloud that had fallen upon the spiritof the lord james was cleared away by thiscourageous demonstration and he took hiskinsman by the hand saying i throw myself celestine upon you andthe honour of your clan carry me wheresoeveryou pleasethus it came to pass that on the same dayon which sir robert gramme was taken byglenfruin to the earl of athos the lordjames in the company of his kinsmanarrived at kilchurn on loch aw sidewhere under the name of sir aulay macaufiso the paewifelay of cairndhue a famous hunter in thosedays he was introduced to the seneschal andother of the officersbut the lady had no sooner cast her eyesupon him than she discovered the swarthylineaments of her father's race and at once suspectedhis name and degree but she repressedher surprise and emotion not knowing whetherher son had any suspicion of the rank ofhis guest of whom he spoke as having fallenin with at the chase and had brought to tastethe apples of broach plain and to prove thegood cheer of kilchum for a night i trust however said celestine thatit will fare ill with us if we cannot tempt himto abide a little longer for there are deer inknapdale of a bolder breed than any he hasyet driven in coal or lornthis speech made the lady of loch awstill more suspect that celestine had no imaginationof who his guest was while the suspicionwhich the appearance of the lordthe paewife james had at the first sight inspired was confirmedby the sound of his voice when he rejoinedin a seeming simple manner i shall gladly partake of your pastimefor a day or two and had i my own houndshere i doubt not we should have goodsport then you have left your dogs in lennox said the lady and she looked significantlyas if she wished he might divine theequivocal sense of her question nor was hedull of discerning what she meant yes lady said he the best i have arethere i should say had for they are nolonger minecelestine without having observed the earnestnesswith which his mother had regardedtheir guest and not particularly noting thestrain of this discourse here interposed sayings but we account our dogs better thanthose of lennox and i will show you in thert fk'iriittrikthe spaewife him and he was obliged to turn aside to concealhis agitation and sorrowcelestine saw his emotion and would haveimmediately disclosed the secret to his motherbut at that moment a messenger came into thechamber width letters from sir duncan sayinghow much he took it to heart to hear it reportedthat their son celestine had joined macdonaldat inverness and praying it might notbe so telling her at the same time in whatmanner the rebellious chieftain had come secretlyto holyroodhouse and had there thrownhimself upon the eings mercyseing her son then present and having receivedno gn nor intimation from him tomake her think he had embarked in the rebellionat the same time fearful lest the strangershould be indeed sir aulay macaulayshe did not venture to say or do any thingthat might bring on a disclosure from celestina for the rebellion being ended by themanner in which macdonald had surrendereds th spaewifehimself it became necessary to keep the secretsof those who had engaged in it and sheknew not how sir aulay macaulay stood affectedeither with respect to the king or tothe albanies all this caused a sudden airof restraint and embarrassment to become visiblein her demeanour and she gave theletter to celestine in so particular a mannerthat he retired towards a window to read itapartthe lord james remarked what was passingand seeing mystery and the interchangeof expressive looks between the lady and herson became uneasy and doubted the safetythat he had been promised and his apprehensionswere augmented almost to alarm bythe lady while celestine was reading theletter in the windowbower coming to himand saying softly that she might not be overheardyou know sir aulay that duke murdochwas my brother and therefore i beseechthe spaewife you if you have heard any tidings of thelord james to let me know what you haveheard pthese words she accompanied with so muchof tenderness and grief in her voice and alook so much more pregnant than her wordsthat he could not but discern she had discoveredhim while by what he had noted hewas led to think she desired it might still bethoughtthat she knew him not insteadtherefore of making any reply he took herhastily by the hand and glancing with alarmtowards celestine said to her in a whispersave me knowing how much her son leant to heraffections for the relics of her father's familyshe would have assured the lord james thathe was safe to trust himself with celestinewhom she now supposed entirely ignorant ofhis true name and condition but the rebellionbeing over and the rigour of the eingsjustice having taught her to dread the conesthe spaewifequinces that might ensue to those who hadtaken any part in it and anxious to keep celestinafree from all suspicion of blame believingthat the rumour of his having been at invernesswas unfounded she deemed it prudentto allow him to remain in his supposed ignoranceand still to affect to treat her nephewas sir aulay macaulay accordingly whenshe perceived that celestine had made an endof reading his father's letter she said thimi beseech you to call home your brotherscoin and galespic whom i see yonderin a boat on the loch by themselves goi b for they are yet but mere boys andthe wind is strong and their sail broadcelestine looked from the window and sawhis brothers but in bo such jeopardy as hismother seemed to fear she however feignedto be still more alarmed in so much thathe was obliged to go hastily leaving thelord james alone with her her anxietythe spaewifjs was however but a device to procure anopportunity of conferring with her nephew insecret and also to remove her son from thedanger of being accused of abetting in anymanner his outlawed and sentenced kinsman this house said she the moment theywere by themselves is no place for youand then with a hasty summons she calledfather donich her confessor and chaplainwhom with a brief injunction she desired toconvey him unobserved if possible to his cellon irish ail one of the small islands in thelake he will remain with you there tilli have time before the evening to devisesome way of conducting him to a place ofgreater securitythe weight of his misfortunes so pressedupon the spirit of the lord james when hefound himself betrayed as he thought by theperfidy of his kinsman into a place of dangerthat he parted listlessly from the lady of the spaewifeloch aw and followed the old mon out ofthe castle heedless and almost unconsciousof the way he went but they had not proceededfar till indignation against his treacherouskinsman as he deemed celestine rousedhis spirit and perceiving that there was faithand truth in the character of father donichhe disclosed himself to him and after somecontroversy wher the chaplain urged himto trust to the lady of loch aw it wasagreed that they should travel into lennoxshiretogetherthe spaewife chap xiiithe eings counsellors with sir williamchrichton the chancellor having in themeanwhile determined that macdonald shouldbe held in

congratulate his majesty on thespeedy dissolution of the rebellion all temporal concerns said the bishop are flourishing with a great prosperity underthe benign influence of your majestys fosteringwisdom but things of eternal import areperishing without succour the abbeys thatwere plundered in the misrule which so longafflicted this poor realm are still in ruins the spaewifeand in the roofless churches the owl still worshipsdesolation on those altars where holymen should serve the mass alas manyhouses of piety reared by that blessed monarchyour sainted ancestor king david thefirst

pardonedmany of the churchmen hearing his majestyspeak with this seeming irreverence ofthe honest of all his royal ancestors liftedup their hands and rolled their eyes and someamong them were in great ire the whichbeing observed by the king he added my good bishop wardle i say notthis out of any lack of respect towards thechurch for there is not one of mlyoiu brethrenwhether he wear mitre or bowl thatmore truly reveres the blissful tidings of rethe spaewife legion than does the sinner that how speaksto you but to pierce the heavens with goldenpinnacles like our holy ancestor is not inmy poor judgment the best way to gain admission yet something is due from me intoken of gratitude for the success which hashitherto crowned my endeavours to resuscitatejustice and the renovation of law inscotland and i shall speedily evince thesincerity of my desire to prove that this is noprofession of idle coinlesythese words were comfortable in the earsof the churchmen and so emboldened thesuperior of the black friars of dumbartonthat he settled forward and said but it is not enough for your majesty toconsider only the condition of the religioushouses we beseech you to look at the greatmolestation which we sustain in our goodsand persons many laies meddle with thingsecclesiastical in a way never before heard ofin any christians eland there was a piouss the paewifebrother of my house by name father mungoo he was a precious vessel a light andan ornament to all the church what of him p said the king on the very same night in which yourmajesty so happily rescued the town of dumbartonfrom the lord james an uncircumcisedhighland shore put him to death whether his martyrdom was by tree or by steel byflood or by fire we have never learnt bongin no condition to bring the criminal to justice on that night said his majesty did the friar of whom you speakbelong to bishop finlays friends for youknow father that it has been quite as muchlie custom for ecclesiastics to meddle withthings secular as for laies to meddle withthings ecclesiastical o no r replied the prior of the blackfriar father mungo was a guileless sainthe was not a man that would have joinedthe pairife shimself to any plot of such a traitor as bishopfinland then perhaps he was on our side andthe chieftain what was his name glenfruin glenfruin was he engaged in that rebellion surely i have heard this story before that were a hard thing to say for atleast he took no open part in the worksthe king made no remark on this butfor a short space communed with himself andthen said but however it may have been withglenfruin it is not fit that such irresponsiblejustice should be executed on any man euless on a reverend churchman we shallgive orders to sift this matter and glenfruinshall be made to account for what he hasdonee his majesty then taking bishop wardleaside while those who had come into the the paewifepresence with him were retiring informedhim that he was minded to found a house tothe glory of god in the city of perth andcommanded him to remain at scone until theneedful preparations were madenow it came to pass as they were discoursingof this matter together that theearl of athos came into the chamber withthe petition of sir robert gramme ii hishand and went towards the king to presentit his majesty observing him said with hisfreest urbanitywhat great favour would our good unclethat he comes to us with such elaborationof homage this is something my lordthat you either fear will not be granted orthink should not with these words hismajesty took the paper from the earl butwhen at the first glance he saw it was a petitionfor the remission of a punishment hefolded it up and said gravelyi am grieved my lord to refuse anythe spaewiffi solicitation

albanywhom he had hitherto considered asunderthe cloud of the king's displeasurewith regard to sir robert gramme he stillthought notwithstanding the earl of athos'scoldness that he had done some notable service and he considered that both for his abstinencein the lennoxshire rebellion and thealacrity with which he had obeyed the proclamationto march against macdonald hestood in no peril of much suffering atthe same time he felt himself so environedwith such an array of questionable circumstancesthat he wot not well what to doand therefore it was that in utter inability tocomprehend the situation into which he wasthrown by so many casualties he resolved atonce to go with the herald accordinglyafter again expressing his wonder with somedegree of sharpness at the absence of his sonwho

withoutfarther parley went out from the castlefollowed by his clansmen and apparently withthe design of going to the colquhoun of lessfor the night he parted with glenfruin onthe castlehill whence with the herald andaccompanied by twenty of his own clanaoienthe chieftain was conducted to the road leadingto dumbartonthe spaewife chap xxthe earl of athos was in the meantimegreatly disturbed in his thoughts by reasonchiefly of the freedom wherewith sir robertgrime in the intrepidity of his revenge hadproposed to undertake the assassination of theking he had not however virtue to withstandtemptation nor courage enough if sogood a name may be given to so bad a purposeto embark openly in the avowed treason neither had he the firmness to lay suchan interact on the resentment by which hisnephew was borne away from his fealty as toprevent him from surrendering himself up tothe machinations of the traitor still the desirenot to part with the honour he enjoyedwas so lively within his heart that the samenight after gramme had so fearfully informsthe specifiedhim of his regicide determination he or tered him to be sent forth from the castleand never again to present himself at thegatesgramme so little heeded this commandwhich was delivered to him by stuart thatbefore going away he indited a paper inwhich he set forth his determination never todesist from his hostility against the kingtill he had vindicated his wrongs and satisfiedhis revengegive it said he to the earl andwe shall see what the bravery of his loyaltywill do after so open a proclamation of tresssonstuart however did not that night deliverthe paper but conducted gramme to the gatewhere in the hearing of many of the vassalsbe bade him adieu bitterly grieving that theking should so little esteem such a courageoussoldier as to drive him forth into the wildwoods and so despite fully repulse the pityingthe spaewife friends that petitioned only for some mitigationin the rigour of his punishmentto this condolence the outlaw made no replybut that an avenging hour was coiningwhen perhaps even the ei of athos wouldrepent of having so far lent himself to thecruelty of the kingthe earl replied stuart is not somuch your enemy as you think in banishingyou from his house i believe he actsfrom the compulsion of duty and the dreadof danger to himself for even he is no longersafe what do you mean said gramme whatdanger does he dread and why is it that youaccount him no longer safe he endured replied stuart yesterdaysuch insult merely because he presentedyour humble petition that the king cannotbit know as a man that he must suffer underit and will tremble lest as a man he shouldrevenge it the spaewifethe vassals hearing then discoursing thusopenly of the grievances which their lordhad endured gathered around and the taintof sedition soon infected them all but theoverthrow of an anointed king whose powerwas beginning to be everywhere obeyed andthe genial shade of whose protecting governmentafforded asylum and refuge to allhis wronged and longidicted subjects wasan enterprise not to be hastily undertakenin this manner however the crafty policywhich gramme had breathed into the spirit ofstuart was made to take effect and the vassalsof the earl of athos were corrupted fromtheir loyalty even before he was himself entirelysubduedin the morning stuart went forth fromthe castleagate and at a short distance therefromaffected to find on the grass the defiancewhich gramme had penned he immediatelyreturned and began to question thewarders concerning it and he read it aloudthe spaewipe to them deploring the doom that had workedso brave a spirit into such frantic ecstasyhe then carried it to the earl and eagerlywatched his looks as he read but thoughthe fated old man grew pale and his handstrembled he made no remark he lookednot however at stuart but turned away hisface as if he had something to hide from thepiercing inquisition of his eyesthree several times did stuart endeavourto draw him into discourse concerning thepaper but he made him no answer heheld it however still in his hand sometimeshe looked at it and at others laid it down onthe table and walked to and fro communingwith himselfstuart waited with silence and patience tosee the issue of this secret controversy andwas awed and confounded when after a seasonthe earl called one of his trustiest officersand bade him ride forthwith to the kingat scone with the rebellious proclamation the spaewifeand to assure his majesty that no meansshould be left untried by him to bring inthe traitorscarcely had this messenger departed onhis journey when kindly letters to the earlcame from the king wherein his majestydescribed the great contrition which he sufferedat having so hastily parted with him and praying him by the name of hisjkindfriend and true uncle to come back to assistin the solemnity of laying the foundationof the stately abbey which he was minded tobuild at perth he also entreated him tobring stuart with him and said many graciousthings all meant to appease the sense ofthe heat wherewith he had expressed himselffor so espousing the cause of sir robertgrammewhen the earl read these courteous lettersto stuart that vindictive youth exclaimedi will never again revisit the courts buttothe spaewife the look which the earl gave him stoppedwhat he would have said and he retiredabashed and overawed when he beheld thetears shoot into the old mans eye as he readthe letters a second timeit cannot be said the momentary penitent that any wrong can come from meto so good and so generous a heart andhe added emphatically i beseech you mydearest nephew to hold no correspondencenor communion with sir robert grammelet us return to the court and with such anexhibition as befits our birth and the highceremony which the king intends to holdforget the countenance that we have bothunfortunately for ourselves given in thishouse to that implacable adversary of all thatis good and fair in the princely nature of ourroyal kinsmanstuart again made another attempt to revertto the contumely with which he conceivedthe king had treated him and to pray the spaewifethat his presence might be dispensed withbut the earl was peremptory i am notsafe heres said he with a sigh neither ofus are safe in this place by whom are we endangered criedstuart proudlyby ourselves replied the old man andhe turned aside his face and retired from theroom with slow and thoughtful stepshitherto the indignation with which stuarthad received the king's innocent jocularitymade him see nothing but justice and the vindicationof wrong in the treasons which hemeditated but the sad voice and the mournfullook of his uncle made him stand gazingtowards the door by which the earl had retiredand feel a strange and before unfelt sentimentof sorrow mingled with fearas he was standing thus dejected the ladyathos came into the room and he was startledwhen he beheld her very wobegone andseemingly touched with apprehensions of horsspaewife sectorand alarm surely said he to himself the weak old man cannot have told her ofwhat has passed between him and grammeshe however soon relieved his fears bycoming towards him and saying i amglad that sir robert gramme was sent fromthis house for every night that he remainedhere my sleep was made hideous with themost terrible fancies i have had no wholesomerest but only strange snatches of slumberthat have been more ful of disease thanthe entire lack of sleep this very morningi have been afflicted with such a sight thati can hardly yet persuade myself it wasnot some actual deed which i beheld andnot the fantastical imagery of a distempereddreamwhat was it that you saw said stuartparticipating in the horror with which shewas affected oh danot

that moment andthat she might not be questioned by him concerningthe mysterious cause of her grief shestooped behind to clear as it were some entanglementof her robe and then quitted theroom to conceal that she was in tearsthe spaewife chap xxiwhen nigel glehfruin saw that his fatherwas aware of the sex of the lordjames in the disguise of the leddy garments he feared that an immediatesearch would be ordered and alarmedfor the issue instead of returning tothe hall where his absence was so soon remarkedby the herald he followed the trackwhich the fugitive had taken in order to apprisehim of his danger and to aid his escapebut it was some time before he came up withhim indeed not until the lord james hadreached the skirts of the wood along the margentof the lake and was standing there disconsolateand breathless not knowing whatcourse to choosethe jeopardy into which that illfated princes the spaewifehad fallen was too imminent to admit of muchtime for parley and nigel was not a

concerning the things whereof shehad spoken and celestine after going somedistance on the road towards less returnedto the same place considering with himselfthat by the time he again reached the castlehillthe herald with the chieftain and his attendantswould be far advanced on their wayto dumbarton whither as it has been rehearsedthey were minded to go that nightthus it fell out that nigel and celestine metat the castlegate where they respectively conferredof what had come to pass by this foe the night had set in showerythe spaewife sandblustering on the hills so that there wasno choice but for celestine to abide in thecaste notwithstanding the prohibition whichglenfruin himself had laid against all strangersaccordingly after some further parleypartly arising from the jealousy wherewith nigelsaw his clansmen would regard the entranceof the campbellss into the castle during theabsence of their chief it was agreed in orderto present quarrels that celestine aloneshould be admitted and that his men shouldpass the night on the hillabout the time that this had been determinedthe boat which passed the lord jamesand the spiwife arrived at the foot of thewater of glenfruin and those who were onboardhaving landed walked towards thetower the lights of which they had seen fromthe lake but on the shore the driznglyshower so rose on the blast in their faces thatthey were obligated to pass from time to timea wardword among them in order that theys the spaewifemight not scatter themselves so far a to loseone anothermeanwhile celestine being admitted intothe castle the gates were jealously diet and astrong watch set both on the walls and in thecourt m case of any treachery among thecampbell and these wardens hearing thesound of many voices approaching as thestrangers drew near were in great consternationand alarm and secretly called nigel fromthe hal to warn him of dangernor was this without a show of reason forthe campbell as they lay on the ground inthe lea of the furze on the hill also heardthe same sounds afar off and listening andconferring together they discovered the tiewordto be cme that was their own whereuponthey rose with a great shout which strucksuch fear into the breasts of the glenfruinsthat four of them instantly rushed into thehall and seized celestine and father donichas they were sitting together discoursing inthe spaewife the chimney comer and made them prisoners believing that the arrival of a new band ofcampbell at that hour was all of a stratagemto possess themselves of the castlesuchdoings being adventures of ordinary customduring the turbulent rule and regency of thealbaniescelestine and the chaplain not knowingwhat had chanced without were in greatamazement and bitterly reviled the perfidy ofthe glenfruinsthe manner in which the duchess had beenmade prisoner the pretext on which thecampbellss had been denied the ordinaryusages of hospitality and the marvelous cunningas it seemed of a youth so young and fair spoken as nigel were all things somuch of the same quality and spirit that ceheroine could find no sufficient words for hisindignation his greatest alarm howeverwas for his cousin the lord james thetoxy which nigel had told him of his embarksii m the spaewifbtion he believed to be a fraudulent inventionand he made no doubt that the illfated princewas delivered into the custody of the heraldto win favour with the government for hisfatherthe anger of nigel was not less ardentagainst the deceit with which he on his partconceived himself to have been treated andhe returned into the hall with hb sword unsheathedand upbraided celestine with manysharp and rankling taunts in the midsthowever of their mutual upbraiding and thenoise and dissonance that reigned within andwithout a horn was heard at the gatenigel at the sound desisted from thescorn with which he was addressing his suspectedguest and sheathing his sword wentto learn who it was that so courteouslysought admission finding after some shortparley that the strangers were clothed withauthority from theing he gave orders toletthem in and soon returned ushering themjthe spabwife into the hall where celestine and fatherdonich were still standing in the middle ofthe floor with their arms pinioned to dieisides by the fierce and stalwart glenfruinsthe strangers were sir duncan campbellof loch aw the father of celestine and sirpatrick gramme of kincardine with certainof their respective retainerssir duncan was sent by the king to takethe duchess from glenfruin and to conducther wheresoever she chose to go and sirpatrick was empowered with a royal mandateto raise the country in order that effectualsearch might be made for the lord jamesthey had come together from the buchananshore in the same boat though their missionswere so different and out of tenderness forher grace's great sufferings it was covenantedbetween them that until she was removedsir patrick should say nothing of his warrantnor move in the execution thereof itwas in consequence thought by nigel to the spaewifbwhom sir duncan had declared the purportof their visit that they were come for thesame objectbut the knight of loch aw had no soonerentered the hall when seeing the singularand ignominious manner in which his sonand domestic chaplain were held than he loudlydemanded an explanationcelestine knowing how little his fatherwould approve of the adventure in which hehad embarked for the lord james brieflystated that in pursuit of his game he hadbeen led to lochlomondside and had come inthe afternoon to glenfruin wherein was mindedto spend the night but that in a suddenmanner both he and father donich were madeprisoners and held in the condition in whichhe saw them the reason wherefor h couldnot divine unless it were to extort from thema ransom such as glenfruin himself hadintended to do with his aunt the duchessof albany who was then in the castlethe spaewife this tale did not however satisfy sirduncan campbell who was no stranger tothe partialities which his son bore towardshis mother's turbulent kindred and he turnedround abruptly to father donich and demandedto know how he too was there what game said he has led father dorichto lochlomondsidesir patrick grseme was not a little amazedat idiot was thus passing and listened andlooked on with his mind apert and his suspicionsall awake for he well knew howmuch the house of loch aw was divided miaccountof the filial affections of the ladyfather donich bang at a loss what answerto make instead of replying struggled to befree of those who held him in their gripin the meantime nigel remembering whatcelestine had said with respect to the differencebetween him and his father concerninghis kinsman quickly discovered the hastyerror which in a moment of alarm he had so the spaewifkdiscourteously committed against his guestand replied without seeming to have observed what sir duncan had said to fatherdonich i am grieved for what has happened but this evening my father was summonedby horn and caption to appear before theking and having been taken away it washiscommand that during his absence strangersshould not be admitted when howevercelestine campbell came hither icould not deny him so much hospitality ashelter for the night still anxious howeverthat my father's orders should not bealtogether contemned it was agreed thathis clansmen should remain on the hillwhere it would appear when they heard youcoming they shouted and made a noise thewhich caused us to fear that the campbellwere come first with celestine to gain admissionby stratagem and then with you to cooksummit the plotthe spaewifb the tale is plausible said sir patrickgrasme but how id it that this reverendfriar is also here father donich now having recovered hiswits was able to frame a fdr story replied i was sent by my good lady of loch awto bear her kind and loving condolence tothe duchessmay this be credited p inquired sirpatrick addressing himself to sir duncanwho evidently in much trouble said i pray you do not sift me in this toocuriously i have ever done my duty as atrue man in the king's service and i havenever known my son guilty of any dishonouri think it may not be questioned that my wifewas likely to send her chaplain on the errandwhich he says and i will acknowledge toyou freely that i suspect my son has alsocome with some similar intenti see not replied the knight of kincardine much to condemn in all that butxt th spaewifturning to nigel he added have yoaheard ought ia these parts of the traitorjames of albany b yes replied nigel he was here thisafternoon what in diis castles inquired sirpatrick eagerly celestine campbell gaspedand father donich stood like one that smitten with some inexpressible despondency no not in the castles resumed nigel but just under the walls and what has become of him whydid you not seize him wherefore was heallowed to escape exclaimed sir patrickgramme he was not allowed to escape o treacherous villain p muttered celestinaunable any longer to restrain his griefat such treacherysir duncan campbell said nothing butruefully shook his head while sir patrickresumed addressing sir duncan the spaemafe the poor creature in the boat with thedeaf and dumb woman has then told us truehe has been carried to dumbartonnigel immediately discerned that they musthave met the lord james in his disguisewith anniple and he added briskly iknow not by whom he was taken but mostlikely it may have been by the governor ofdumbarton who has at present with him agreat forcecelestine looked at nigel and felt that hehad done the youth injustice but he couldmake no atonement in the presence of thosebefore whom he then stoodi fear celestine said his father thatyou have greatly incurred the king's displeasure but since your unfortunate cousinis taken go with sir patrick gramme in themorning to perth and do what you can tomake your peace with his majesty as soonas i have executed my orders with respect tothe duchess i will follow you thithermt the spaewifethus was order restored in the hall ofglenfruin and next morning all due preparationfor the same being made theduchess with

nigel according towhat had been sanctioned with the lord jamesascended the hill behind the tower of glenruinto see if he might discover where theprince had landed by the smoke of any fireon the ben lomond side of the lake butalthough the air was clear and still in somuch that the shadows of all things in thewater were not rumpled by the transit of thesoftest breeze he yet could discern no signalof the kind and he returned to the castle inmuch tribulation of spirit and rested hisforehead on his hand not knowing what heshould then do for being scarcely morethan a stripling he lacked that confidence inhimself which prompts to faith in others tub spaewotand anxkms as he was to consult with someofthose of the clan whom he knew to he holdand discreet he was diffident to trust themwith the

thoughts walked on in hence and anniple followed ever and anonlifting the skirt of his plaid to screen herfrom the rain as she went coweringly behindcrooning some old uncouth dittytheir search however was in vain for neitherrock nor tree could be found and thoughfrom time to time the faint and ghastly lightof the northern streams broke from thethe spaewife clouds and dimly showed all around the blackmoss and the dark heaving waters no sign ofany shelter could be discovered still thewind was rising the showers were comingheavier aid faster and anniple not only refrainedfrom churning her song but beganto ban the malicious fairies that had made herto suffer such a life of molestationas they were thus wandering in the gloomthe lord james chanced to stumble into aplace whence seats had been delved andwould have fallen headlong but that at thetime anniple had hold of his plaid whenhowever he recovered and turned round tospeak to her she was gone having dartedaway like an arrow from a bow notwithstandingthe darkness of the night she ranstraight back to the boat on board of whichshe leapt at once and gathered herself asit were into a bunch in the bottom saying beds were made for the blest and the the spaewifeixmh but the lea of a deal or a dyke's goodenough for mein that situation she fell asleep and whenshe awoke and looked over ths side of theboat e found that the tempest haa ceasedand that the grey eye of the morning wasjust beginning to peer through the mist intowhich the heavy clouds of the night had resolvedthemselvesbeing cold and wet she almost immediatelycowered down again into the bottom of theboat but suddenly recollecting that she wasalone and in the middle of the lake she startsed up and began to cry and bail with a loudand shrill voice in the hope that she might beheard then she attempted to move theoars which swung on pivots but they were tooponderous for her strength and she soonabandoned the toil at last she bethoughtherself of the ragged remnant that servedher for a mantle and getting up on a benchshe spread it to the wind in this mannerthe spaewifje she drifted near to the shore where theriver leven runs away there leaving theboat loose on the margent of the lake shewent up the country reckless of the conditionin which she had left her companionit had however fared better with thelord james than with her for after sheleft him he came to a hovel raised by thepeatmakers to sleep in when employed indigging the turf and he went into it andfound a better asylum than i could havehoped to meet with on that lone and meancopious island having struck a limit withhis sword from a shone he kindled a fire withsome of the moss and turf wherewith the bieldwas covered at which he sat fcr some timeexpecting the spaewife but seeing she camenot he went often to the door and called herbynine fearing that some accident had befallenher as however she never made herappearance he began to conjecture that shehad perhaps found some sdndlar place of shvol ii k the paewifeter and oompofled himself to sleep to whichhe was the more eaaify invited by the anxietiesand the toil he had undergonein this state of defencelessness he continuedtill the sun was risen and whenhe awoke he beheld an old man of a veryvenerableaspect standing mournfully overhim his countenance was pale dejectedand meek and there was a holiness in hiseyes that betokened the patient melancholyof a reigned and sorrowful heart hisgarb and the rosary at his girdle shewedthat he was a priest but he wore no cowand his grey hair fell over his dark vesturelike the breaking of a silva strewn down therocky side of a heathy hillthe lord james at once started up andgazing at him for a moment rushed into hisfjeitheriy embraces for in him lie discoveredthe aged confessor of his

he followed the earl more briskly thanever and entered into a chamber with himwhere as the old man untied the mantle thathe had worn in the pageant stuart saide i was alarmed lest the show shouldhave been interrupted by some dreadful accident the paewife row r replied iik earl what warthere to cause such apprehension saw youany thing to be afraid of p i observed that as the king strewed thecom wine and oil upon the stone you grewlory palesthe ears colour again disappeared andhis hand so shook that he rather entangledthan untied the knot he was endeavouring toundo but he made no answer while stuartcontinued with a little more eottsdexiee in hismanner i saw that your eye was drawn towardssome one in the crowds think your said the earl eagerly thatit was remarked of me p it was replied stuartthe emotion of the earl on hearing this becameso manifest that he sat down having hkmantle still untied and inquired with ananxious and alarmed voice by whom he hadbeen observedthe spafiwife sllby one in the garb of a wild highlander his locks were shaggy his beard untrimmedand his clothes were made up seemingly ofdivers rags the cast weeds of several beggarsthey were so preposterously wretched hewaa apparelled as one might be that hath someflaw in his wit and yet was he plainly not ofthat nature for his eye was sharp and steadyand lighted up with a spirit full of menaceand inventions it was not safe that a creature so fierceand fantastical should have had leave to bewhere he wash sid the earldid you not my lord then know himreplied stuart but instead of answering thequestion the earl said thoughtfullythink you that he was noticed by theking or by any of those who were immediatelyaround his majesty i once or twice observedthe eyes of the chancellor turned tothat side what signifies it if he did look hows the pawifshould he discover him if your lordshipcould not who are privy to his purpose to what purpose exclaimed the earlwith a voice of terror to what purpose pand he rose hastily and walked with hurriedsteps and perturbed gestures several timesto and fro in the chamber suddenly he appearedto become calm and going to stuarthe said with a solemn voice in which therewas much sadness i charge you as you dread my displeasureand the kings power never to speakwith him touching the rights of which i wasdefrauded for he is so maddened by the senseof his own wrongs and hath such a tongue tomake the bad appear the better purpose thatout of the despite which we have ourselvesborne he may deduce reasons that shall enticeyou into great perils my lord of whom do you speak repliedstuart with welufdgned amfachy andwonderment the spaewife the earl wrung his hands rapidly breathedquickly and looking round hastilycried i will have nothing to do with

mention of the name was like a spelland the earl who had been so heady rashand distempered in his manner became atonce serene and collected sayingshe has been too hardly dealt with andadversity like a cruel rust has defaced theoriginal brightness of his character but suchwoful diane is not rare i have knownother men as well as poor sir robert grammewhom heaven had intended for high purposesbut fortune and irresponsible accidentso transmuted the gold of their nature intovol ii o the spaewifeiron that at their exit from the scene ofthis mortal theatre instead of being honouredwith the peals and plaudits of admirationthey have been followed by scorn and hissingand their names loaded with all manner ofcontumely so basely according to the judgmentof men did they fail in the performanceof their part and that too from nothing seeminglyin circumstance but altogether fromthe meanness i would say the malice oftheir motiveless endeavours and should honest men stand by andsee spirits of such
