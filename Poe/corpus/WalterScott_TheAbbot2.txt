remindedhim was the young maiden he hadmet on the preceding day she then becthe abbotstowed on him her solemn benediction andbade god speed himthere was something in her manner andher conduct which

novelty herejoiced that he was travelling towardsedinburgh in order to assume the characterof a man and lay aside that of a boy hewas delighted to think that he would havean opportunity of rejoiningcatherinesey tonwhose bright eyes and lively manners hadmade so favourable an impression on hisimagination and as an inexperienced yethighspirited youth entering for the firsttime upon active life his heart bounded atthe thought that he was about to see allthose scenes of courtly splendour and warlikeadventures of which the followers ofsir halbert used to boast on their occathe abbot signal visits to avenel to the wondermentand envy of those who like roland knewcourts and camps only by hearsay andwere condemned to the solitary sports andalmost monastic seclusion of avenel surroundedby its lonely lake and embosomedamong its pathless mountains they shallmention my name he said to himself ifthe risk of my life can purchase me opportunitiesof distinction and catherine

sense of rapturousexcitation and he possessed it bybeing once more mounted on the back ofa fiery and active horse instead of ploddingalong on foot as had been the case duringthe preceding daysimpelled by the liveliness of his own spiritswhich so many circumstances tendednaturally to exalt roland graeme's voiceand his laughter were soon distinguishedb the abbotamid the trampling of the horses of the retinueand more than once attracted the attentionof their leader who remarked withsatisfaction that the youth replied withgoodhumoured raillery to such of the trainas jested with him on his dismissal and returnto the service of the house of avenel i thought the holly branch in yourbonnet had been blighted master rolandsaid one of the menatarms only pinched with half an hour's frost you see it flourishes as green as ever it is too grave a plant to flourish on sohot a soil as that headpiece of thine masterroland gramme retorted the otherwho was an old equerry of sir halbertglendinning if it will not flourish alone said roland i will mix it with the laurel and themyrtle and i will carry them so near thesky that it shall make amends for theirstinted growth thus speaking he dashed his spurs intohis horse's sides and checking him at thesame time compelled him to execute a loftythe abbot caracole sir halbert glendinning lookedat the demeanour of his new attendant withthat sort of melancholy pleasure with whichthose who have long followed the pursuitsof life and are sensible of their vanity regardthe gay young and buoyant spiritsto whom life as yet is only hope and promisein the meanwhile adam woodcock thefalconer stripped of his pasquin habit andattired according to his rank and callingin a green jerkin with a bag on the oneside and a short hanger on the other aglove on his left hand which reached halfvay up his arm and a bonnet and featherupon his head came after the party as fastas his active little gallowaynag could trotand immediately entered into parley

the youth which the knight of avenel hath totransfer my service supposing that i oweit to himselfhush hush said the falconer thatis a question i advise no one to stir in untilhe has the mountain or the lake or themarch of another kingdom which is betterthan either betwixt him and his feudal superior but sir halbert glendinning said theyouth is not my feudal superior nor hashe aught of authority i pray you my son to rein yourtongue answered adam woodcock mylord's displeasure if you provoke it will beworse to appease than my lady's thetouch of his least finger were heavier thanher hardest blow and by my faith he isa man of steel as true and as pure but ashard and as pitiless you remember thethe abbot tcock of capellae whom he hanged overhis gate for a mere mistake a poor yokeof oxen taken

the guardianship of peterbridge ward as he was called though hewas now very old sir halbert glendinninghalted his retinue and beckoned to woodcockand greene to advance to the headof the train the abbot woodcock said he thou knowestto whom thou art to conduct this youthand thou young man obey discreetly andwith diligence the orders that shall begiven thee curb thy vain and peevishtemper be just

pursued his way towardsthe chain of hills within whose recesses aresituated the lake and castle of avenelthere remained behind the falconer rolandgraeme and a domestic of the knightof inferior rank who was left with them tolook after their horses while on the roadto carry their baggage and to attend totheir conveniencethe abbot so soon as the more numerous body ofriders had turned off to pursue their journeywestward those whose route lay acrossthe river and was directed towards thenorth summoned the bridgeward and demandeda free passagei will not lower the bridge answeredpeter in a voice querulous with age andillhumour come papist come protestantye are all the same the papist threatenedus with purgatory and fleeced uswith pardons the protestant mints at uswith the sword and cuttle us

cannonand demicannon and all the barkingbulldogs whom they halloo against stoneand lime in these our days it was a merrytime when there was little besides handyblows and it may be a flight of arrowsthat harmed an ashley wall as little as somany hailstones but we must jowl andthe abbot itlet the jaw gang by comforting himself in his state of diminished consequencewith this pithy old proverb peter bridgewardlowered the drawbridge and permittedthem to pass over at the sight of hiswhite hair albeit it discovered a visageequally peevish through age and misfortuneroland was inclined to give him an almsbut adam woodcock withheld him e'enlet him pay the penalty of his former churlishnessand greed he said j the wolfwhen he has lost his teeth should be treatedno better than a curleaving the bridgeward to lament thealteration of times which sent domineeringsoldiers and feudal retainers to his place ofpassage instead of peaceful pilgrims andreduced him to become the oppressed insteadof playing the extortioner the travellersturned them northward and adamwoodcock well acquainted with that partof the country proposed to cut short aconsiderable portion of the road by traversthe abbotsing the little vale of glendearg so famousfor the adventures which befel therein duringthe earlier part of the benedictine'smanuscript with these and with the thousandcommentaries representations andmisrepresentations to which they had givenrise roland graeme was of course wellacquainted for in the castle of avenel aswell as in other great establishments theinmates talked of nothing so often or withsuch pleasure as of the private affairs oftheir lord and lady but while roland wasviewing with interest these haunted scenesin which things were said to have passedbeyond the ordinary laws of nature adamwoodcock was still regretting in his secretsoul the unfinished revel and the unsungballad and kept every now and then breakingout with some such verses as these the friars

would have had a heartylaugh and that is what he seldom enjoys if it be all true that men tell of his earlylife said roland he has less right tolaugh at goblins than most men ay i it be all true answered adamwoodcock but who can insure us ofthat moreover these were but tales themonks used to gull us simple laymen withal they knew that fairies and hobgoblinsbrought aves and paternosters into repute but now we have given up worship of imagesin wood and stone methinks were notime to be afraid of bubbles in the water orshadows in the airthe abbot but said roland graeme as the catholicssay they do not worship wood orstone but only as emblems of the holysaints and not as things holy in themselves pshaw pshaw answered the falconer a rush for their prating they toldus another story when these baptized idolsof theirs brought pikestaves and sandalledshoon from all the four winds and chilledthe old women out of their corn andtheir candleends and their butter baconwool and cheese and when not so muchas a grey groat escaped tithingroland graeme had been long taught bynecessity to consider his form of religion asaprofound secret and to say nothing whatsoeverin its defence when assailed lest heshould draw on himself the suspicion of belongingto the unpopular and explodedchurch he therefore suffered adam woodcockto triumph without farther oppositionmarvelling in his own mind whether any ofthe goblins formerly such active agents the abbotwould avenge his rude raillery before theyleft the valley of glendearg but no suchconsequences followed they passed thenight quietly in a

andhe knows courtcattle well that if you aretold old king could is come alive again youshould turn it off with and is he in truth the abboti heard not of it and should seem nomore moved than if one told you by wayof novelty that old king could was dead andburied wherefore look well to your bearingmaster roland for i promise you youcome among a generation that are keen asahungry hawk and never be

ended thegambol by burning the church there again now replied his companion you go down the wind like a wildhaggard that minds neither lure nor beckthat is a question you should have askedin as low a tone as i shall answer itif i stay here long said rolandthe abbot grasme it is like i shall lose the naturaluse of my voice but what are the ruinsthen the kirk of field said the falconerin a low and impressive whisper laying atthe same time his finger on his lip askno more about it somebody got foul playand somebody got the blame of it and thegame began there which perhaps may notbe played out in our time poor henrydarnley to be an ass he understood somewhatof a hawk but they sent him on thewing through the air himself one brightmoonlight nightthe memory of this catastrophe was sorecent that the page averted his eyes withhorror from the scathed ruins in which ithad taken place and the accusationsagainst the queen to which it had givenrise came over his mind with such strengthas to balance the compassion he had begunto entertain for her present forlorn situationit was indeed with that agitating state the abbotof mind which arises partly from horrorbut more from eager interest and curiositythat young graeme found himself actuallytraversing the scene of those tremendousevents the report of which had disturbedthe most distant solitudes in scotland likethe echoes of distant thunder rolling amongthe mountainsnow he thought now or never shall ibecome a man and bear my part in thosedeeds which the simple inhabitants of ourhamlets repeat to each other as if they werewrought by beings of a superior race totheir own i will know now wherefore theknight of avenel carries his crest so muchabove those of the neighbouring baronageand how it is that men by valour and wisdomwork their way from the hoddin graycoat to the cloak of scarlet and gold mensay i have not much wisdom to recommendme and if that be true courage must doitfor i will be a man amongst living menor a dead corpse amongst the deadfrom these plans of ambition he turnedthe abbot his thoughts to those of pleasure and beganto form many conjectures when and wherehe should see catherine seyton and inwhat manner their acquaintance was to berenewed with such conjectures he wasamusing himself when he found that theyhad entered the city and all other feelingswere suspended in the sensation of giddyastonishment with which the inhabitant ofa solitary country is affected when for thefirst time he finds himself in the streets ofa large and populous city a unit in themidst of thousandsthe principal street of edinburgh wasthen as now one of the most spacious ineurope the extreme height of the housesand the variety of gothic gables and battlementsand balconies by which the skylineon each side was crowned and terminatedtogether with the width of the streetitself might have struck with surprise amore practised eye than that of younggraeme the population close packedwithin the walls of the city and at this time the abbotincreased by the number of the lords ofthe king's party who had thronged to edinburghto wait upon the regent murrayabsolutely swarmed like bees on the wideand stately street instead of the shopwindowswhich are now calculated for thedisplay of goods the traders had their openbooths projecting on the street in whichas in the fashion of the modern bazaars allwas exposed which they had upon saleand though the commodities were not ofthe richest kinds yet greene seemed to seethewealth of the whole world in the variousbales of flanders cloths and the specimensof tapestry and at other places the displayof domestic utensils and pieces of silverplatestruck him with wonder the sight ofcutlers booths furnished with swords andponiards which were manufactured in scotlandand with pieces of defensive armourimported from flanders added to his surprise and at every step he found so muchto admire and to gaze upon that adamwoodcock had no little difficulty in pretheabbot wailing on him to advance through sucha scene of enchantmentthe sight of the crowds which filled thestreets was equally a subject of wonderhere a gay lady in her muffler or silkenveil traced her way delicately a gentlemanusher making way for her a pagebearing up her train and a waiting gentlewomancarrying her bible and intimatingthat her purpose was towards the church there he might see groupe of citizens bendingthe same way with their short flemishcloaks wide trowsers and highcaped doubletsa fashion to which as well as to theirbonnet and feather the scots were longfaithful then again came the clergymanhimself in his black geneva cloak and bandlending a grave and attentive ear to the discourseof several persons who accompaniedhim and who were doubtless holding seriousconverse on the religious subject he wasabout to treat of nor did there lack passengersof a different class and appearanceb s the abbotat every turn roland graeme might seea gallant ruffle along in the newer or frenchmode his doublet slashed and his pointsof the same colours with the lining his longsword on one side and his poniard on theother behind him a body of stout servingmenproportioned to his estate and qualityall of whom walked with the air of militaryretainers and were armed with sword andbuckler the latter being a small roundshield not unlike the highland target havinga steel spike in the centre two ofthese parties each headed by a person ofimportance chanced to meet in the verycentre of the street or as it was called the crown of the causeway a post ofhonour as tenaciously asserted in scotlandas that of giving or taking the wallused to be in the more southern part of theisland the two leaders being of equal rankand most probably either animated by politicaldislike or by recollection of somefeudal enmity marched close up to eachother without yielding an inch to the rightthe abbot or the left and neither shewing the leastpurpose of giving way they stopped for aninstant and then drew their swords theirfollowers imitated their example about ascore of weapons at once flashed in thesun and there was an immediate clatter ofswords and bucklers while the followers oneither side cried their master's name theone shouting help a leslie a leslie while the others answered with shouts ofseyton seyton with the additional punningslogan set on set on bear theknaves to the groundif the falconer found difficulty in gettingthe page to go forward before it was nowperfectly impossible he reined up hishorse clapped his hands and delightedwith the fray cried and shouted as fast asany of those that were actually engagedin itthe noise and cries thus arising on thehigh gait as it was called drew into thequarrel two or three other parties of gentlemenand their servants besides some singlepassengers who hearing a fray betwixt these the abbottwo distinguished names took part in it eitherfor love or hatredthe combat became now very sharpand although the swordand buckler menmade more clatter and noise than theydid real damage yet several good cutswere dealt among them and those whowore rapiers a more formidable weaponthan the ordinary scottish sword gave andreceived dangerous wounds two men werealready stretched on the causeway andthe party of seyton began to give groundbeing much inferior in number to theother with which several of the citizenshad united themselves when young rolandgraeme beholding their leader a noblegentleman fighting bravely and hardpressed with numbers could withhold nolonger adam woodcock he said anyou be a man draw and let us take partwith the seyton and without waiting areply or listening to the falconers earnestentreaty that he would leave alone a strifein which he had no concern the fiery youthsprung from his horse drew his short swordthe abbot and shouting like the rest a seyton aseyton set on set on thrust forward intothe throng and struck down one of thosewho was pressing hardest upon the gentlemanwhose cause he espoused this suddenreinforcement gave spirit to the weakerparty who began to renew the combatwith much spirit when four of the magistratesof the city distinguished by theirvelvet cloaks and gold chains came up witha guard of halberdiers and citizens armedwith long weapons who well accustomedto such service thrust boldly forward andcompelled the swordsmen to separate whoimmediately retreated in different directionsleaving such of the wounded on bothsides as had been disabled in the fray lyingon the streetthe falconer who had been tearing hisbeard for anger at his comrade's rashnessnow rode up to him with the horse whichhe had caught by the bridle and accostedhim with master roland master goosemaster madcap will it please you toget on horse and budge or will you resthe abbotmain here to be carried to prison and madeto answer for this pretty day's work the page who had begun his retreatalong with the seytons just as if he hadbeen one of their natural allies was by thisunceremonious application made sensiblethat he was acting a foolish part andobeying adam woodcock with some senseof shame he sprung actively on horsebackand upsetting with the shoulder of the animala cityofficer who was making towardshim he began to ride smartly down thestreet along with his companion and wasquickly out of the reach of the hue andcry in fact rencounters of the kindwere so common in edinburgh at this periodthat the disturbance seldom excitedmuch attention after the affray was overunless some person of consequence chancedto have fallen an accident which imposedon his friends the duty of avenginghis death upon the first convenient opportunityso feeble indeed was the arm ofthe police that it was not unusual for suchskirmishes to last for hours where the partheabbot ties were numerous and well matched butat this time the regent a man of greatstrength of character aware of the mischiefwhich usually arose from such acts of violencehad prevailed with the magistrates tokeep a constant guard on foot for preventingor separating such affrays as had happenedin the present casethe falconer and his young companionwere now riding down the canongate andhad slackened their pace to avoid attractingattention the rather that there seemed tobe no appearance of pursuit roland hunghis head as one who was conscious his conducthad been none of the wisest while hiscompanion thus addressed himwill you be pleased to tell me onething master roland graeme and that iswhether there be a devil incarnate in youor no truly master adam woodcock answeredthe page i would fain hope thereis not then said adam i would fain know the abbotby what other influence or instigation youare perpetually at one end or the other ofsome bloody brawl what i pray hadyou to do with these seytons and lesliethat you never heard the names of in yourlife before you are out there my friend said rolandgraeme i have my own reasons forbeing a friend to the seytons they must have been very secret reasonsthen answered adam woodcockfor i think i could have wagered you hadnever known one of the name and i amapt to believe still that it was rather yourunhallowed passion for that clashing of coldiron which has as much charm for you asthe clatter of a brass pan hath for a hive ofbees more than any care either for seytonor for leslie that persuaded you to thrustyour fool's head into a quarrel that no waysconcerned you but take this for a warningmy young master that if you are to drawsword with every man who draws swordon the highgait here it will be scarcethe abbot worth your while to sheathe bilbo again forthe rest of your life since if i guess rightlyit will scarce endure on such terms formany hours all which i leave to your seriousconsiderationby my word adam i honour youradvice and i promise you that i will practiseby it as faithfully as if were swornapprentice to you to the trade and mysteryof bearing myself with all wisdom and safetythrough the new paths of life that i amabout to be engaged in and therein you will do well said thefalconer and i do not quarrel with youmaster roland for having a grain overmuchspirit because i know one may bringto the hand a wild hawk which one nevercan a dunghill hen and so betwixt twofaults you have the best side on't but besidesyour peculiar genius for quarrellingand lugging out your side companion mydear master roland you have also the giftof peering under every woman's muffler andscreen as if you expected to find an oldacquaintance though were you to spy one the abboti should be as much surprised at it wellwetting how few you have seen of these samewildfowl as i was at your taking so deepan interest even now in the seyton tush man nonsense and folly answeredroland graeme i but sought tosee what eyes these gentle hawks have gotunder their hooday but it's a dangerous subject of inquirysaid the falconer you had betterhold out your bare wrist

ere adam woodcockcould finish the sermon which was the abboting on his tongue roland graeme to thefalconer's utter astonishment threw himthe bridle of his jennet jumped off horsebackand pursued down one of the closesor narrow lanes which opening under avault terminate upon the main street thevery maiden to whom his friend had accusedhim of shewing so much attention and whohad turned down the pass

draught said his hospitablefriend again supplying the flagon froma pitcher which stood beside i know theway to the butterybar and now mindwhat i say this morning the earl of mortoncame to my lord in a mighty chafewhat they keep the old friendshipthen said woodcock the abbotay ay man what else said michael one hand must scratch the otherbut in a mighty chafe was my lord of mortonwho to say truth looketh on such occasionsaltogether uncanny and as it werefiendish and he says to my lord for i wasin the chamber taking orders about a castof hawks that are to be fetched from darnway they match your long winged falconsfriend adam i will believe that when i see them flyas high a pitch replied woodcock thisprofessional observation forming a sort ofparenthesis however said michael pursuing histale my lord of morton in a mightychafe asked my lord regent whether hewas well dealt with for my brother saidhe should have had a gift to be commendatorof kennaquhair and to have all thetemporalities erected into a lordship of regalityfor his benefit and here said hethe false monks have had the insolence tochuse a new abbot to put his claim in mybrother's way j and moreover the rascalitythe abbot of the neighbourhood have burnt and plunderedall that was left in the abbey so thattiny brother will not have a house to dwellin when he hath ousted the lazy hounds ofpriests and my lord seeing him chafed saidmildly to him these are shrewd tidingsdouglass but i trust they be not true forhalbert glendinning went southward yesterdaywith a band of spears and assuredlyhad either of these chances happened thatthe monks had presumed to chuse an abbotor that the abbey had been burnt asyou say he had taken order on the spot forthe punishment of such insolence and haddispatched us a messenger and the earlof morton replied now i pray you adamto notice that i say this out of love to youand your lord and also for old comradeshipand also because sir halbert hathdone me good and may again and alsobecause i love not the earl of morton asindeed more fear than like him so then itwere a foul deed in you to betray me butsaid the earl to the regent take heed mylord you trust not this glendinning too the abbotfar he comes of churl's blood which wasnever true to the nobles by saint andrewthese were his very words and besideshe said he hath a brother a monk in saintmary's and walks all by his guidance andis making friends on the border with buckand with fernieherst and will joinhand with them were there likelihood of anew world and my lord answered like afree noble lord as he is tush my lordof morton i will be warrant for blendingfaith and for his brother he is adreamer that thinks of nought but bookand breviary and if such hap have chancedas you tell of i look to receive from glendiningthe cowl of a hanged monk andthe head of a riotous churl by way of sharpand sudden justice and my lord of mortonleft the place and as it seemed tomesomewhat malcontent but since thattime iii lord has asked me more thanonce whether there has arrived no messengerfrom the knight of avenel and all thisi have told you that you may frame yourthe abbot discourse to the best purpose for it seemsto me that my lord will not be well pleasedif aught has happened like what mylord of morton said and if your lord hathnot ta'en strict orders with itthere was something in this communicationwhich fairly blanked the bold visageof adam woodcock in spite of the reinforcementwhich his natural hardihood hadreceived from the berry brown ale of holyrood what was it he said about a churl'shead that grim lord of morton said thediscontented falconer to his friendnay it was my lord regent whosaid that he expected if the abbey was injuredyour knight would send him the headof the ringleader among the rioters nay but is this done like a good protestantsaid adam woodcock or a truelord of the congregation we used to betheir whiteboys and darlings when we pulleddown the convents in fife and perthshires the abbot ay but that said michael waswhen old mother rome held her own andher great folks were determined she shouldhave no shelter for her head in scotlandbat now that the priests are fled in all quartersand their houses and lands are givento our grandees they cannot see that weareworking the work of reformation in destroyingthe palaces of zealous protestantsbut i tell you saint mary's is not destroyed said woodcock in increasing agitation some trash of painted windowsthere were broken things that no noblemancould have brooked in his housesomestone saints were brought on theirmarrowbones like old warrington atchevychace but as for fire raising therewas not so much as a lighted lunt amongstus save the match which the dragon had tolight the burning tow withal which he wasto spit against saint george nay i hadcaution of that how adam woodcock said his comthe'abbot srade i trust thou hadst no hand in sucha fair work look you adam i were lothto terrify you and you

answered adam i am tooold to have my head turned by any maidenof them all i know my lord of mortonwill go as far for a buxom lass as any one but what the devil took him to halifax allthe way and if he have got a gamesterthere what hath she to do with my head much much answered michael herod's daughter who did such executionwith her foot and ancle danced notraen'sheads offmore cleanly than this

in my life what and thou sir halbert blendingpage said the regenti was brought up as my lady's pagesaid the youth and left avenel castle forthe first time in my life at least since mychildhood only three days sincemy lady's page repeated the earlof murray as if speaking to himself itwas strange to send his lady's page on amatter of such deep concernment mortonwill say it is of a piece with the nominationof his brother to be abbot and yet in somesort an inexperienced youth will best servethe turn what hast thou been taughtyoung man in thy doughty apprenticeship to hunt my lord and to hawk

neverhad the good fortune to see a strickenfield the good fortune repeated the resthe abbotgent smiling somewhat sorrowfully takemy word young man war is the only gamefrom which both parties rise losersnot always my lord answered thepage with his characteristic audacity iffame speaks truth how sir said the regent colouringin his turn and perhaps suspecting anindiscreet allusion to the height which hehimself had attained by the hap of civil warbecause my lord said roland graemewithout change of tone she who fights wellmust have fame in life or honour in death and so war is a game from which no onecan rise a losersthe regent smiled and shook his headwhen at that moment the door opened andthe earl of morton presented himselfi come somewhat hastily he said andi enter unannounced

morton hisdark red brow growing darker and redderas he spoke morton said murray suspect menot touch not mine honour i have tosuffer enough from the calumnies of foeslet me not have to contend with the unjustsuspicions of my friends we are notalone said he recollecting himself or igould tell you morehe led morton into one of the deepembrasures which the windows formed inthe massive wall and which afforded a retiringplace for their conversing apart inthis recess roland observed them speaktogether with much earnestness murrayappearing to be grave and earnest andmorton having a jealous and offended airwhich seemed gradually to give way to theassurances of the regentas their conversation grew more earnestthey became gradually louder in speechhaving perhaps forgotten the presence of the abbotthe page the more readily as his positionin the apartment placed him out of sightso that he found himself unwillingly privyto more of their discourse than he cared tohear for page though he was a meancuriosity after the secrets of others had neverbeen numbered amongst roland's failings and moreover with all his naturalrashness he could not but doubt the safetyof becoming privy to the secret discourseof these powerful and dreaded men still hecould neither stop hisearsnorwithproprietyleave the apartment j and while he thoughtof some means of signifying his presencehe had already heard so much that to haveproduced himself suddenly would have beenas awkward and perhaps as dangerous asin quiet to abide the end of their conferencewhat he overheard however wasbut an imperfect part of their communication and although a more expert politicianacquainted with the circumstances ofthe times would have had little difficulty intracing the meaning yet roland graemethe abbot could only form very general and vagueconjectures as to the import of their discourse all is prepared said murray andlindesay is setting forward she must hesitateno longer thou seest i act by thycounsel and harden myself

the abbotin the mid volley and sways the arrow fromthe marksay not so morton replied murrayi have both dared and doneyes enough to gain but not enough tokeep reckon not that she will think andact thus you have wounded her deeplyboth in pride and in power it signifiesnought that you would tent now the woundwith unavailing salves as matters standwith you you must forfeit the title of anaffectionate

notmade of iron like thee and i cannot butremember enough of thismy purposeholdsand i warrant me said morton thechoice of these domestic consolations willrest with here he whispered names which escapedthe abbot roland graeme's ear murray replied in asimilar tone but so much raised towardsthe conclusion of the sentence that thepage heard these words and of him ihold myself secure by glendinning's recommendationay which may be as much trustworthyas his late conduct at the abbey ofsaint mary's you have heard his brother'selection has taken place your favouritesir halbert my lord of murray has asmuch fraternal affection as yourselfby heaven morton that taunt demandedan unfriendly answer but i pardon it foryour brother also is concerned but thiselection shall be annulled i tell

contrary he felt like one wholooks on a romantic landscape of whichhe sees the features for the first time andthen obscured with mist and driving tempestthe imperfect glimpse which the eyecatches of

sirrobert an elderly and respectable looking the abbotgentleman the only one of the party whoseemed above the rank of a retainer ordomestic and observed that they must getto horse with all speedduring this discourse and while theywere riding slowly along the street of thesuburb roland had time to examine moreaccurately the looks and figure of the baronwho was at their headlord lindesay of the byres

and grizzled beard of the grimthe abbot old baron and totally hid the lower partof his face the rest of his dress was a loosebuffcoat which had once been lined withsilk and adorned with embroidery but

proceeded at a steady trot towardsthe westward as they prosecuted theirjourney roland graeme would gladly havelearned something of its purpose and tendencybut the countenance of the personagenext to whom he had been placed in thetrain discouraged all approach to familiaritythe baron himself did not look moregrim and inaccessible than his feudal retainerwhose grizzly beard fell over hismouth like the portcullis before the gate ofa castle as if for the purpose of preventingthe escape of any word of which absolutenecessity did not demand the utterancethe rest of the train seemed under thesame taciturn influence and journeyed onwithout a word being exchanged amongstthem more like a troop of carthusian friarsthan a party of military retainers rolandgraeme was surprised at this extremityof discipline for even in the householdof the knight of avenel though somewhatdistinguished for the accuracy with which the abbotdecorum was enforced a journey was a pes riot of licence during which jest and songand every thing within the iitnits of becomingmirth and pastime was freely permittedthis unusual silence was however sofaracceptable that it gave him time tobring any shadow of judgment which hepossessed to council on his own situationand prospects which would have appearedto any reasonable person in the highest degreedangerous and perplexingit was quite evident that he had throughvarious circumstances not under his own controul formed contradictory connexionswith both the contending factions by whosestrife the kingdom was distracted withoutbeing properly an adherent of either itseemed also clear that the same situation inthe household of the deposed queen towhich he was now promoted by the influenceof the regent had been destined tohim by his enthusiastic grandmother magdalengrme for on this subject the wordswhich morton had dropped had been a raythe abbot lof light yet it was no less clear that thesetwo persons the one the declared enemythe other the enthusiastic votary of the catholicreligion the one at the head of theking's new government the other who regardedthat government as a criminal usurpationmust have required and expected verydifferent services from the individual whomthey had thus united in recommending itrequired very little reflection to foresee thatthese contradictory claims on his servicesmight speedily place him in a situationwhere his honour as well as his life mightbe endangered but it was not in rolandgrasme's nature to anticipate evil before itcame or to prepare to combat difficultiesbefore they arrived i will see this beautifuland unfortunate mary stuart said he of whom we have heard so much andthen there will be time enough to determinewhether i will be kinsman or queensmannone of them can say i have givenword or promise to either of their factions for they have led me up and down like a the abborblind billy without giving me any light intowhat i was to do but it was lucky thatgrim douglas came into the regent's closetthis morning otherwise i had never gotfree of him without plighting my troth todoall the earl would have me which seemedafter all but foul play to the poor imprisonedlady to place her page as an espialon herskipping thus lightly over a matter ofsuch consequence the thoughts of the hairbrainedboy went a woolgathering aftermore agreeable topics now he admiredthe gothic towers of barnbougle risingfrom the seabeaten rock and overlookingone of the most glorious landscapes in scotland and now he began to consider whatnotable sport for the hounds and the hawksmust be afforded by the variegated groundover which they travelled and now hecompared the steady and dull trot at whichthey were then prosecuting their journeywith the delight of sweeping over hill anddale in pursuit of his favourite sports asthe abbot under influence of these joyous recollectionshe gave his horse the spur and madehim execute a gambade he instantly incurredthe censure of his grave neighbour whohinted to him to keep the pace and movequietly and in order unless he wished suchnotice to be taken of his eccentric movementsas was likely to be very displeasingto himthe rebuke and the restraint under whichthe youth now found himself brought backto his recollection his late goodhumouredand accommodating associate and guideadam woodcock and from that topic hisimagination made a short flight to avenelcastle to the quiet and unconfined life of itsinhabitants the goodness of his early protectressnot forgetting the denizens of itsstables kennels and hawk mews in a briefspace all these subjects of meditation gaveway to the remembrance of that riddle ofwomankind catherine sey ton who appearedbefore the eye of his mind now in herfemale form now in her male attire now the abbotin both at once like some strange dreamwhich presents to us the same individualunder two different characters at the sameinstant her mysterious present also recurredto his recollection the sword whichhe now wore at his side and which he wasnot to draw save by command of his legitimatesovereign but the key of this mysteryhe judged he was likely to find in theissue of his present journeywith such thoughts passing through hismind roland graeme accompanied theparty of lord lindesay to the queen'sferrywhich they passed in vessels thatlay in readiness for them they encounteredno adventure whatsoever in their passagesexcepting one horse being lamed ingetting into the boat an incident very commonon such occasions until a few yearsago when the ferry was completely regulatedwhat was more peculiarly characteristicof the olden age was the discharge ofa culverin at the party from the battlementsof the old castle of rosette on thethe abbot ltiorth side of the ferry the lord of whichhappened to have some public or privatequarrel with the lord lindesay and tookthis mode of expressing his resentmentthe insult however as it was harmless remainedunnoticed and unavenged nor didanything else occur worth notice until theband had come where lochleven spread itsmagnificent sheet of waters to the beams ofa bright summer sunthe ancient castle which occupies anisland nearly in the centre of the lake recalledto the page that of avenel in whichhe had been nurtured but the lake wasmuch larger and adorned with several isletsbesides that on which the fortress was situated and instead of being embosomed inhills like that of avenel had upon thesouthern side only a splendid mountainousscreen being the descent of one of the lomondhills and on the other was surroundedby the extensive and fertile plain ofkinross roland grasme looked with somedegree of dismay on the watergirdled fortsthe abbottress which then as now consisted only ofone large donjonkeep surrounded with acourtyard with two round flankingtowersat the angles which contained wutliin itscircuit some other buildings of inferiorimportance a few old trees clustered togethernear the castle gave some relief tothe air of desolate seclusion but yet thepage while he gazed upon a building sosequestered could not but feel for the situationof a captive princess doomed todwell there as well as for his own i musthave been born he thought under the starthat presides over ladies and lakes of waterfor i cannot by any means escape from theservice of the one or from dwelling in theother but if they allow me not the fairfreedom of my sport and exercise they shallfind it as hard to confine a wilddrake as ayouth who can swim like onethe band had now reached the edge ofthe water and one of the party advancingdisplayed lord lindesay's pennon wavingit repeatedly to and fro while that baronthe abbot himself blew a clamorous blast on his buglea banner was presently displayed from theroof of the castle in reply to these signalsand one or two figures were seen busied asif unmooring a boat which lay close to theisletit will be some time ere they can reachus with the boat said the companion ofthe lord lindsay should we not do wellto proceed to the town and array ourselvesin some better order ere we appear befores you may do as you list sir robertreplied lindesay have neither time

brought allscotland do not speak so harshly said sir robert if she hath done wrong she hathdearly abed it and in losing all real powervol n h the abbotone would not deprive her of the little

ofdames the bower of dames my lord saidmelville looking at the rude old tower is it yon dark and grated castle theprison of a captive queen to which yougive so gay a name name it as you list replied lindesay had the regent desired to send an envoycapable to speak to a captive queen thereare many gallants in his court who wouldhave courted the occasion to make speechesout of amadis of gaul or the mirror ofknighthood but when he sent blunt oldlindesay he knew he would speak to a misguidedwoman as her former misdoings andher present state render necessary i soughtnot this employment it has been thrustthe abbot upon me and i will not cumber myself withmore form in the discharge of it than needsmust be tacked to such an occupationso saying lord lindesay threw himselffrom horseback and wrapping his ridingcloakaround him lay down at lazy lengthupon the sward to await the arrival of theboat which was now seen rowing from thecastle toward the shore sir robert melvillewho had also dismounted walked at shortturns to and fro upon the bank his armscrossed on his breast often looking to thecastle and displaying in his countenance amixture of sorrow and of anxiety the restof the party sate like statues on horsebackwithout moving so much as the points oftheir lances which they held upright in theairas soon as the boat approached a rudequay or landingplace near to which theyhad stationed themselves lord lindesaystarted up from his recumbent posture andasked the person who steered why he had the abbotnot brought a larger boat with him to transporthis retinue so please you replied the boatmanbecause it is the order of our lady thatwe bring not to the castle more than fourpersons thy lady is a wise woman said lindsay to suspect me of treachery or hadi intended it what is to hinder us fromthrowing you and your comrades into thelake and filling the boat with my own fellowsthe steersman on hearing this made ahasty signal to his men to back their oarsand hold oft from the shore which theywere approachingwhy thou ass said lindesay thoudidst not think that i meant thy fool's headserious harm hark thee friend withfewer than three servants i will go nowhithersir robert melville will requireat least the attendance of one domestic and it will be at your peril and your lady'sthe abbot to refuse us admission come hither as weareon matters of great national concernthe steersman answered with firmnessbut with great civ ility of expression that hisorders were positive to bring no more thanfour into the island but he offered to rowback to obtain a revisal of his orders do so my friend said sir robert melvilleafter he had in vain endeavoured topersuade his stubborn companion to consentto a temporary abatement of his trainrow back to the castle sith it will be nobetter and

anduninformed reader of the striking traits which the abbotcharacterize that remarkable countenancewhich seems at once to combine our ideas ofthe majestic the pleasing and the brilliantleaving us to doubt whether they expressmost happily the queen the beauty or theaccomplished woman who is there at thevery mention of mary stuart's name thathas not her countenance before him familiaras that of the mistress of his youth orthe favourite daughter of his advanced age even those who feel themselves compelledto believe all or much of what her enemieslaid to her charge cannot think withouta sigh upon a countenance expressiveof anything rather than the foul crimeswith which she was charged when livingand which still continue to shade if notto blacken her memory that brow sotruly open and regal

lochleven whoon her part endeavoured to conceal dislikeand apprehension under the appearance ofrespectful indifference the truth was thatshe had experienced repeatedly the queen'ssuperiority in that species of disguised yetcutting sarcasm with which women can successfullyavenge themselves for real andsubstantial injuries it may be well doubtedwhether this talent was not as fatal tothe abbot its possessor as the many others enjoyed bythat highly gifted but most unhappy femalefor while it often afforded her a momentarytriumph over her keepers it failed not toexasperate their resentment and the satireand sarcasm in which she had indulgedwhere frequently retaliated by the deep andbitter hardships which they had the powerof inflicting it is well known that herdeath was at length hastened by a letterwhich she wrote to queen elizabeth inwhich she treated her jealous rival and thecountess of shrewsbury with the keenestirony and ridiculeas the ladies met together the queensaid bending her head

to consider in what relation the abborthey were to stand to each other she heldup her hand to me in a commanding mannerhe thought j perhaps she wanted toconfirm my purpose for the execution ofthe queen's commands for i think shecould scarce purpose to scare me with thesort of discipline which she administered tofreezejacket and to poor adam woodcockbut we will see to that anon j meantimelet us do justice to the trust reposedin us by this unhappy queen i think mylord of murray will himself own that it isthe duty of a faithful page to defend his ladyagainst intrusion on her privacyaccordingly he stepped to the little vestibulemade fast with lock and bar thedoor which opened from thence to the largestaircase and then sate himself down to attendthe result he had not long to waita rude and strong hand first essayed tolift the latch then pushed and shook thedoor with violence and when it resisted hisattempt to open it exclaimed undo thedoor there you within the abbot why and at whose

withdirections from the queen to admit sir robertmelville and lord lindesay rolandgreene returned to the vestibule and openedthe door accordingly into which thelord lindesay strode with the air of a soldierwho has fought his way into a conqueredfortress j while melville deeply dejectedfollowed him more slowlyi draw you to witness and to recordsaid the page to this last that save forthe especial commands of the queen iwould have made good the entrance withmy best strength and my best blood againstall scotland be silent young man said melvillein a tone of grave rebuke add not brandsto dre this

my lord replied sir roberttime presses not and lord ruthven hathnot as yet descendedat this moment the door of the innerapartment opened and queen mary presentedherself advancing with an air of peculiargrace and majesty and seeming totallyunruffled either by the visit or by therude manner in which it had been enforcedher dress was a robe of black velvet asmall ruff open in front gave a full viewof her beautifully formed chin and neck butveiled the bosom on her head she worea small cap of lace and a transparent whiteveil hung from her shoulders over the longblack robe in large loose folds so that itcould be drawn at pleasure over the faceand person she wore a cross of goldaround her neck and had her rosary of goldand ebony hanging from her girdle she wasclosely followed by her two ladies who remainedstanding behind her during the contheabbot terence even lord lindesay though therudest noble of that rude age was surprisedinto something like respect by the unconcernedand majestic mien of her whomhe had expected to find frantic with impotentpassion or dissolved in useless andvain sorrow or overwhelmed with the fearslikely in such a situation to assail fallenroyalty we fear we have detained you mylord of lindesay said the queen whileshe curtsied with dignity in answer to hisreluctant obeisance but a female doesnot willingly receive her visitors withoutsome minutes spent at the toilette menmy lord are less dependant on such ceremonieslord lindsay casting his eye down onhis own travelstained and disordered dressmuttered something of a hasty journey andthe queen paid her greeting to sir robertmelville with courtesy and even asit seemed with kindness there was thena dead pause during which lindesay the abboted towards the door as if expecting withimpatience the colleague of their embassythe queen alone was entirely unembarrassedand as if to break the silence she addressedlord lindesay with a glance at thelarge and cumbrous sword which he woreas already mentioned hanging from hisneckyou have there a trusty and a weightytravelling companion my lord i trust youexpected to meet with no enemy hereagainst whom such a formidable weaponcould be necessary it is methinks somewhata singular ornament for a courtthough i am as i well need to be toomuch of a stuart to fear a sword it is not the first time madam repliedlindesay bringing round the weaponso as to rest its point on the ground andleaning one hand on the huge crosshandleit is not the first time that this weaponhas intruded itself into the presence of thehouse of stuart possibly my lord replied the queenthe abbot it may have clone service to my ancestors your ancestors were men of loyalty ay madam replied he service ithath done but such as kings love neitherto acknowledge nor to reward it was theservice which the knife renders to the treewhen trimming it to the quick and deprivingit of the superfluous growth of rankand unfruitful suckers which rob it of nourishment you talk riddles my lord said mary i will hope the explanation carries nothinginsulting with it you shall judge madam answeredlindesay with this good sword wasarchibald douglas earl of angus girdedon the memorable day

opponent and lopped the limb aseasily as a shepherd's boy slices a twig froma sapling my lord replied the queen reddening my nerves are too good to be alarmedeven by this terrible history may i askhow a blade so illustrious passed from thehouse of douglas to that of lindesay methinks it should have been preserved asaconsecrated relique by a family who haveheld all that they could do against theirking to be done in favour of their countrynay madam said melville anxiouslyinterfering ask not that question of lordlindesay and you my lord for shame for decency forbear to reply to it it is time that this lady should hear thetruth replied lindesaythe abbot and be assured that she will be movedto anger by none that you can tell her mylord there are cases in which just scornhas always the mastery over just anger then know said lindesay that uponthe field of carburyhill when that falseand infamous traitor and murtherer jamessometime earl of both well and nicknamedduke of orkney offered to do personalbattle with any of the associated nobleswho came to drag him to justice i acceptedhis challenge and was by the nobleearl of morton gifted with this good swordthat i might therewith fight it out ah sohelp me heaven had his presumption beenone grain more or his cowardice one grainless i should have done such work withthis good steel on his traitorous corpse thatthe hounds and carrioncrows should havefound their morsels daintily carved to theiruse the queen's courage well nigh gave wayto the mention of bothwell's name a nameconnected with such a train of guilt shame the abbotand disaster but the prolonged boast oflindesay gave her time to rally herself andto answer with an appearance of cold contempt it is easy to slay an enemy whoenters not the lists but had mary

his form and featuresprocured him the popular epithet ofgreysteil by which he was distinguishedby his intimates after the hero of a metricalromance then generally known his dresswhich was a buffcoat embroidered had ahalf military character but exhibited nothingof the sordid negligence which distinguishedthat of lindesay but the sonof an illfated sire and the father of a yet the abbotmore unfortunate family bore in his lookthat cast of inauspicious melancholy bywhich the physiognomists of that time pretendedto distinguish those who were predestinedto a violent and unhappy deaththe terror which the presence of thisnobleman impressed on the queen's mindarose from the active share he had bornein the slaughter of david rizzio his fatherhaving presided at the perpetrationof that abominable crime although so weakfrom long and wasting illness that he couldnot endure the weight of his armour havingarisen from a sickbed to commit amurther in the presence of his sovereignon that occasion his son also had attendedand taken an active part it was littleto be wondered at that the queenconsidering her condition when such adeed of horror was acted in her presenceshould retain an instinctive terror for theprincipal actors in the mulier she returnedhowever with grace the salutationof lord ruthven and extended her handthe abbot to george douglas who kneeled and kissedit with respect the first mark of a subject'shomage which roland graeme had seen anyof them render to the captive sovereign shereturned his greeting in silence and therewas a brief pause during which the stewardof the castle a man of a sad brow and a severeeye placed under george douglas'sdirections table and writing materials andthe page obedient to his mistress's dumbsignal advanced a large chair to the side onwhich the queen stood the table thus forminga sort of bar which divided the queenand her personal followers from her unwelcomevisitors the steward then withdrewafter a low reverence when he had closedthe door behind him the queen broke silenceswith your favour my lords iwill sit my walks are not indeed extensiveenough at present to fatigue me greatlyyet i find repose something more necessarythan usualshe sate down accordingly and shadingher cheek with her beautiful hand looked the abbotkeenly and impressively at each of the noblesin turn mary fleming applied herkerchief to her eyes and catherine seytonand roland graeme exchanged a glancewhich showed that both were too deeplyengrossed with sentiments of interest andcommiseration for their royal mistress tothink of any thing which regarded themselves i wait your business my lords saidthe queen after she had been seated forabout a minute without a word being spoken i wait your message from those youcall the secret council i trust it is a petitionof pardon and a desire that i willresume my rightful throne without usingwith due severity my right of punishingthose vvho have dispossessed me of itmadam replied ruthven it is painfulfor us to speak harsh truths to a princesswho has long ruled us but we come tooffer not to implore pardon in a wordmadam we have to propose to you on thethe abbot part of the secret council that you signthese deeds which will contribute greatlyto the pacification of the state the advancementof god's word and the welfare of yourown future life am i expected to take these fair wordson

ruthven required replied the queen withsome emphasis but the phrase suits wellthe matter read my lordthe lord ruthven proceeded to read aformal instrument running in the queen'sname and setting forth that she had beencalled at an early age to the administrationof the crown and realm of scotland and hadtoiled diligently therein until she was inbody and spirit so wearied out and disgustedthat she was unable any longer to endurethe travail and pain of state affairs j and the abbotthat since god blessed her with a fair andhopeful son she was desirous to ensure to him even while she yet lived his successionto the crown which was his by right of hereditarydescent wherefore the instrumentproceeded we of the motherly affectionwe bear to our said son have renouncedand demitted and by these ourletters of free good will renounce and demitthe crown government and guiding of therealm of scotland in favour of our said sonthat he may succeed to us as native princethereof as much as if we had

how is this my lordsshe said are my ears turned rebels thatthey deceive me with sounds so extraordinary and yet it is no wonder that havingconversed so long with rebellion theyshould now force its language upon my understanding say i am mistaken my lordssay for the honour of yourselves andthe scottish nobility my right trusty cousinsof lindesay and ruthven two baronsof warlike fame and ancient line have notsought the prisonhouse of their kind mistressfor such a purpose as these words seemto imply say for the sake of honour andloyalty that my ears have deceived me no madam said ruthven

dispositionsthe franticviolence with which you the magnatesof scotland enter into feuds against eachother sticking at no cruelty to gratify yourwrath taking deep revenge for the slightestoffences and setting at defiance thosewise laws which your ancestors made forstaunching of such cruelty rebelling againstthe lawful authority and bearing yourselvesas if there where no king in the land or ratheras if each were king in his own premisesand now you throw the blame on the abbotme on me whose life has been embittered whose sleep has been broken whosehappiness has been wrecked by your dissentionshave

yourmisgovernment may sometimes have startledyou in the midst of a masque or galliard or it may be that such may have interruptedthe idolatry of the mass or thejesuitical counsels of some french ambassadorbut the longest and severest journeywhich your grace has taken in my memorywas from hawick to hermitage castlej and whether it was for the weal of thethe abbot slstate or for your own honour rests withyour grace's consciencethe queen turned to him with inexpressiblesweetness of tone and manner andthat engaging look which heaven had assignedher as if to shew that the choicestarts to win men's affections may be givenin vain lindesay she said you spokenot to me in this stern tone and with suchscurril taunt yon fair summer evening whenyou and i shot at the butts against the earlof mar

lindesay i know not unless honourshave changed mannershardhearted as he was lindesay seemedstruck with this unexpected appeal but almostinstantly replied madam it is wellknown that your grace could in those daysmake fools of whomsoever approached you the abboti pretend not to have been wiser thanothers but gayer men and better courtierssoon jostled aside my rude homage and ithink your grace cannot

j i must pray your decisionon this weighty matter which i havesubmitted to you what my lord said the queen uponthe instant and without a moment's time todeliberate can the council as they

should have held youprepared for the measure now proposed asthe easiest escape from your numerous dangersand difficulties great god exclaimed the queen and is it as a boon that you propose tomewhat every christian king ought to regardas a loss of honour equal to the loss oflife you take from me my crown mypower my subjects my wealth my statewhat in the name of every saint can youoffer or do you

heaven and to receive thepure gospel which you have ever rejectedand persecutedk sic the abbotthe queen turned pale at the menacewhich this speech as well as the rough andinflexible tones of the speaker seemed distinctlyto infer and if i do not complywith your request so fiercely urged mylord what then follows she said this in a voice in which femaleand natural fear was contending with thefeelings of insulted dignity there was apause as if no one cared to return to thequestion a distinct answer at length ruthevenspoke there is little need to tellto your grace who are well read both inthe laws and in the chronicles of the realmthat murder and adultery are crimes forwhich ere now queens themselves have suffereddeathand where ray lord or how found youan accusation so horrible against her whostands before you said queen mary the foul and odious calumnies whichhave poisoned the general mind of scotlandand placed me a helpless prisoner inyour hands are surely no proof of

ruthven we know thatyou are an orator and perhaps for that reasonthe council has sent hither men whoseconverse hath been more with the wars thanwith the language of the schools or the cabalsof state we but desire to know if onassurance of life and honour ye will demitthe rule of this kingdom of scotland and what warrant have i said thequeen that ye will keep treaty with meif i should barter my

having indulged his passionto such extent under a sullen and contemptuoussmilethe queen immediately began with anexpression of pain to bare the arm whichhe had grasped by drawing up the sleeve ofher gown and it appeared that his grasphad left the purple marks of his iron fingersupon her flesh my lord she said asaknight and gentleman you might havespared my frail arm so severe a proof thatyou have

consequenceor of mere formality when she hadperformed this painful task she arose andhaving curtsied to the lords was about towithdraw to her chamber ruthven andsir robert melville made the first a formalreverence the second an obeisance inthe abbot which his desire to acknowledge his sympathywas obviously checked by the fear ofappearing in the eyes of his colleagues toopartial to his former

not angry with me in sinceritycasting herself as she spoke into thearms of her friend and continuing with atone of apologetic fondness while she kissedher on either side of the face youknow my dear

so i am wilful and saucy but let me remain but a week in this castleand o my dear fleming my spirit willbe as chastised and as humble as thineowndame mary fleming's sense of dignityand love of form could not resist this the abbotaffectionate appeal she kissed catherineseyton in her turn affectionately while answeringthe last part of her speech she said now our lady forbid dear catherinethat you should lose aught that is beseemingof what becomes so well your light heartand lively humour keep but your sharpwit on this side of madness and it cannotbut be a blessing to us but let me go madwench i hear her grace touch her silvercall and extricating herself from catherine'sgrasp she went towards the door ofqueen mary from which was heard thelow tone of a silver whistle which now onlyused by the boatswains in the navy wasthen for want of bells the ordinary modeby which ladies even of the very highestrank summoned their domestics whenshe had made two or three steps towardsthe door of the queen's apartment howevershe turned back and advancing to theyoung couple whom she left together shesaid in a very serious though a low tone i trust it is impossible that we can any ofthe abbot us or in any circumstances forget that fewas we are we form the household of thequeen of scotland and that in her calamityall boyish mirth and childish jestingcan only serve to give a great triumph toher enemies who have already found theiraccount in objecting to her the lightnessof every idle folly that the young and thegay practised in her court so saying sheleft the apartmentcatherine seyton seemed much struckwith this remonstrance she suffered herselfto drop into the seat which she hadquitted when she went to embrace damemary fleming and for some time restedher brow upon her hands while rolandgraeme looked at her earnestly with a mixtureof emotions which perhaps he himselfcould neither have analyzed nor explainedas she raised her face slowly from the postureto which a momentary feeling of selfrebukehad depressed it her eyes encounteredthose of roland and became graduallyanimated with their usual spirit of the abbotpious drollery which not unnaturally exci ted a similar expression in those of the equally volatile page they sat for thespace of two minutes each looking at the other with great seriousness on their featuresand much mirth in their eyes until at length catherine was the first to breaksilence may i pray you fair sir she beganvery demurely to tell me what you seein my face to arouse looks so extremely sagaciousand knowing as those with whichit is your

degree secluded and lonely varied onlyas the weather permitted or rendered impossiblethe queen's usual walk in the gardenor on the battlements the greater part ofthe morning she wrought with her ladies atthose pieces of needle work many of whichstill remain proofs of her indefatigable applicationat such hours the page was permittedthe freedom of the castle and islet nay he was sometimes invited to attendgeorge of douglas when he went a sportingthe abboting upon the lake or on its margin j opportunitiesof diversion which were onlyclouded by the remarkable melancholywhich always seemed to brood on that gentleman'sbrow and to mark his whole demeanour a sadness so profound that rolandnever observed him to smile or tospeak any word unconnected with the immediateobject of their exercisethe most pleasant part of roland's daywas the occasional space which he was permittedto pass in personal attendance on thequeen and her ladies together with the regulardinnertime which he always spentwith dame mary fleming and catherineseyton on these occasions he had frequentoccasion to admire the lively spirit and inventiveimagination of the latter damselwho was unwearied in her contrivances toamuse her mistress and to banish for a timeat least the melancholy which preyed onher bosom she danced she sung she recitedtales of ancient and modern times withthat heartfelt exertion of talent of whichthe abbot the pleasure lies not in the vanity of displayingit to others but in the enthusiasticconsciousness that we possess it ourselvesand yet these high accomplishments weremixed with an airof rusticity and hairbrainedvivacity which seemed rather to belongto some village maid the coquette of thering around the maypole than to the highbreddescendant of an ancient baron atouch of audacity altogether shorts effronteryand far less approaching to vulgaritygave as it were a wildness to all that she didand mary while defending her from someoccasional censure of her grave companioncompared her to a trained singingbird escapedfrom a cage which practises in all theluxuriance of freedom and in full possessionof the greenwood bough the airs whichit had learned during its earlier captivitythe moments which the page was permittedto pass in the presence of this fascinatingcreature danced so rapidly awaythat brief as they were they compensatedthe weary dulness of all the rest of the daym the abtthe space of indulgence however wasalways brief nor were any private interviewsbetwixt him and catherine permittedor even possible whether it were somespecial precaution respecting the queen'shousehold or whether it were her generalideas of propriety dame fleming seemedparticularly attentive to prevent the youngpeople from holding any separate correspondencetogether and bestowed for catherine'ssole benefit in this matter the fullstock of prudence and experience which shehad acquired when mother of the queen'smaidens of honour and by which she hadacquired their hearty hatred casual meetingshowever could not be prevented unlesscatherine had been more desirous ofshunning or roland graeme less anxiousin watching for them a smile a gibea sarcasm disarmed of its severity by thearch look with which it was accompaniedwas all that time permitted to pass betweenthem on such occasions but suchpassing interview neither afforded time northe abbot opportunity to renew the discussion of thecircumstances attending their earlier acquaintancenor to permit roland to investigatemore accurately the mysterious apparitionof the page in the purple velvet cloakat the hostelry of saint michael'sthe winter's months slipped heavily awayand spring was already advanced whenroland graeme observed a gradual changein the manners of his fellow prisonershaving no business of his own to attendto and being like those of his age educationand degree sufficiently curious concerningwhat passed around he became bydegrees to suspect and finally to be convincedthat there was something in agitationamong his companions in captivityto which they did not desire that he shouldbe privy nay he became almost certainthat by some means unintelligible to himqueen mary held correspondence beyondthe walls and waters which surrounded herprisonhouse and that she nourished somesecret hope of deliverance or escape inthe conversations betwixt her and her the abbottenants at which he was necessarily presentthe queen could not always avoidshewing that she was acquainted with theevents which were passing abroad in theworld and which he only heard throughher report he observed that she wrotemore and worked less than had been herformer custom and that as if desirous to lullsuspicion asleep she changed her mannertowards the lady lochleven into one moregracious and which seemed to express aresigned submission to her lot theythink i am blind he said to himself andthat i am unfit to be trusted because i amso young or it may be because i was senthither by the regent well be it so they may be glad to confide in me in thelong run and catherine seyton for as saucyas she is may find me as safe a confidant asthat sullen douglas whom she is always runningafter it may be they are angry withme for listening to master elias henderson but it was their own fault for sending methere and if the man speaks truth and goodsense and preaches only the word of godthe abbot he is as like to be right as either pope orcouncilsit is probable that in this last conjectureroland graeme had hit upon the real causewhy the ladies had not entrusted him withtheir counsel he had of late had severalconferences with henderson on the subjectof religion and had given him to understandthat he stood in need of his instructionsalthough he had not thought therewas either prudence or necessity for confessingthat hitherto he had held the tenets ofthe church of romeelias henderson a keen propagator ofthe reformed faith had sought the seclusionof lochleven castle with the express purposeand expectation of making convertsfrom rome amongst the domestics of thedethroned queen and confirming the faith ofthose who already held the protestant doctrinesperhaps his hopes soared a little higherand he might nourish some expectationof a proselyte more distinguished in the personof the deposed queen but the the abbottenacity with which she and her female autenants refused to see or listen to himrendered such hope if he nourished it altogetherabortivethe opportunity therefore of enlargingthe religious information of rolandgraeme and bringing him to a more duesense of his duties to heaven was hailedby the good man as a door opened byprovidence for the salvation of a sinnerhe dreamed not indeed that he was convertinga papist but such was the ignorancewhich england displayed upon somematerial points of the reformed doctrinethat master henderson while praising hisdocility to the lady lochleven and hergrandson seldom failed to add that his venerablebrother henry warden must benow decayed in strength and in mind sincehe found a catechumen of his flock so illgrounded in the principles of his belieffor this indeed roland graeme thought itwas unnecessary to assign the true reasonwhich was his having made it a point ofthe abbot honour to forget all that henry wardentaught him as soon as he was no longercompelled to repeat it over as a lesson acquiredby rote the lessons of his new instructorif not more impressively deliveredwere received by a more willing earand a more awakened understanding andthe solitude of lochleven castle was favourableto graver thoughts than the pagehad hitherto entertained he wavered yetindeed as one who was almost persuaded but his attention to the chaplain's instructionsprocured him favour even with thestern old dame herself and he was once ortwice but under great precaution permittedto go to the neighbouring village ofkinross situated on the mainland to executesome ordinary commission of his unfortunatemistressfor some time roland greene might beconsidered as standing neuter betwixt thetwo parties who inhabited the watergirdledtower of lochleven but as he rose in theopinion of the lady of the castle and her the abbotchaplain he perceived with great grief thathe lost ground in that of mary and her femaleallieshe came gradually to be sensible thathe was regarded as a spy upon their discourseand that instead of the ease withwhich they had formerly conversed in hispresence without suppressing any of thenatural feelings of anger or sorrow ormirth which the chance topic of the momenthappened to call forth their talk wasnow studiously restricted to the most indifferentsubjects and a studied reserveobserved even in their mode of treatingthese this obvious want of confidence wasaccompanied with a correspondent changein their personal demeanour towards theunfortunate page the queen who hadat first treated him with marked courtesynow scarce spoke to him save to conveysome necessary command for her servicethe lady fleming restricted her notice tothe most dry and distant expressions of civilityand catherine seyton became bittheabbot ter in her pleasantries and shy cross andpetted in any intercourse they had togetherwhat was yet more provoking hesaw or thought he saw marks of intelligencebetwixt george douglas and thebeautiful catherine seyton and sharpenedby jealousy he wrought himself almostinto a certainty that the looks which theyexchanged conveyed matters of deep andserious import no wonder he thought ifcourted by the son of a proud and powerfulbaron she can no longer spare a wordor look to the poor fortuneless pagein a word roland graeme's situationbecame truly uncomfortable and his heartnaturally enough rebelled against the injusticeof this treatment which deprived himof the only comfort which he had receivedfor submitting to a confinement in other respectsirksome he accused queen maryand catherine seyton for concerning theopinion of dame fleming he was indifferentof inconsistency in being displeasedwith him on account of the natural conesthe abbotquinces of an order of their own whydid they send him to hear this overpoweringpreacher the abbot ambrosius herecollected understood the weakness oftheir popish cause better when he enjoinedhim to repeat within his miiid avertand credos and paters all the while oldhenry warden preached or lectured thatso he might secure himself against lendingeven a momentary ear to his hereticaldoctrine but i will endure this life nolonger said he to himself manfully j dothey suppose i would betray my mistressbecause i see cause to doubt of her religion that would be a serving as theysay the devil for god's sake i will forthinto the world he that serves fair ladiesmay at least expect kind looks and kindwords and i bear not the mind of a gentlemanto submit to cold treatment andsuspicion and a lifelong captivity besidesi will speak to george douglas tomorrowwhen we go out together fishinga sleepless night was spent in agitatingthe abbot this magnanimous resolution and he arosein the morning not perfectly decided inhis own mind whether he should abide byit or not it happened that he was summonedby the queen at an unusual hourand just as he was about to go out withgeorge douglas he went to attend hercommands in the garden but as he hadhis anglingrod in his hand the circumstanceannounced his previous intentionand the queen turning to the lady flemingsaid catherine must devise someother amusement for us ma honneamiey ourdiscreet page has already made his partyfor the day's pleasure said from the beginning answeredthe lady fleming that your grace oughtnot to rely on being favoured with the companyof a youth who has so many huguenotacquaintances and has the means ofamusing himself far more agreeably thanwith usi wish said catherine her animatedfeatures reddening with mortification that the abbothis friends would sail away with him forgood and bring us in return a page if sucha thing can be found faithful to his queenand to his religion one part of your wishes may be grantedmadam said roland graeme unable iany longer to restrain his sense of the treatmentwhich he received on all sides and he was about to add i heartily wish youa companion in my room if such can befound who is capable of enduring women's caprices without going distracted luckilyhe recollected the remorse which he had ifelt at having given way to the vivacity ofhis temper upon a similar occasion andclosing his lips imprisoned until it died onhis tongue a reproach so misbecoming thepresence of majesty why do you remain there said thequeen as if you were rooted to the parterre i but attend your grace's commandssaid the page i have none to give you begone sir the abbot as he left the garden to go to the boathe distinctly heard mary upbraid one of herattendants in these words you see towhat you have exposed usthis brief scene at once determined rolandgraeme's resolution to quit the castleif it were possible and to impart his resolutionto george douglas without loss oftime that gentleman in his usual moodof silence sate in the stern of the little skiffwhich they used on such occasions trimminghis fishingtackle and from time totime indicating by signs to greene whopulled the oars which way he should rowwhen they were a furlong or two from thecastle roland rested on the oars and addressedhis companion somewhat abruptly i have something of importance to say toyou under your pleasure fair sirthe pensive melancholy of douglas'scountenance at once gave way to the eagerkeen and startled look of one who expectsto hear something of deep and alarmingimport the abboti am wearied to the very death of thiscastle of lochleven continued rolandis that all said douglas i knownone of its inhabitants who are much betterpleased with it ay but i am neither a native of thehouse nor a prisoner in it and so i mayreasonably desire to leave it you might desire to quit it with equalreason answered douglas if you wereboth the one and the otherbut said roland greene i am notonly tired of living in lochleven castle buti am determined to quit itthat is a resolution more easily takenthan executed replied douglas not if yourself sir and your lady motherchuse to consent answered the page you mistake the matter roland saiddouglas you will find that the consentof two other persons is equally essential that of the lady mary your mistress andthat of my uncle the regent who placedyou about her person and who will notthe abbot think it proper that she should change herattendants so soon and must i then remain whether i willor no demanded the page somewhat appalledat a view of the subject which wouldhave occurred sooner to a person of moreexperienceat least said george douglas youmust will to remain till my uncle wills todismiss you frankly said the page and speakingto you as a gentleman who is incapableof betraying me i will confess that ifi thought myself a prisoner here neitherwalls nor water should confine me ionsfrankly said douglas i could notmuch blame you for the attempt yet forall that my father or uncle or the earl orany of my brothers or in short any of theking's lords into whe hands you fell wouldin such a case hang you like a dog or like asentinel who deserts his post and i promiseyou that you will hardly escape thembut row towards saint serf's island there the abbotis a breeze from the west and we will havesport keeping to windward of the isle wherethe ripple is strongest we will speak moreof what you have mentioned when we havehad an hour's sporttheir fishing was successful though neverdid two anglers pursue even that silentand unsocial pleasure with less verbal intercoursewhen their time was expired douglastook the oars in his turn and by his orderroland greene steered the boat directingher course upon the landingplace at thecastle but he also stopped in the midst ofhis course and looking around him said tograeme there is a thing which i couldmention to thee but it is so deep a secretthat even here surrounded as we are by seaand sky without the possibility of a listeneri cannot prevail on myself to speak it out better leave it unspoken sir answeredroland greene if you doubt the honourof him who alone can hear it i doubt not your honour repliedthe abbot george douglas but you are young imprudentand changeful young said roland i am and itmay be imprudent but who hath informedyou that i am changeful one that knows you perhaps betterthan you know yourself replied douglasi suppose you mean catherine seytonsaid the page his heart rising as he spoke j but she is herself fifty times more variablein her humour than the very water whichwe are floating upon my young acquaintance said douglas i pray you to remember that catherineseyton is a lady of blood and birth andmust not be lightly spoken ofmastergeorgeof douglassaidgrame as that speech seemed to be made underthe warrant of something like a threat i prayyou to observe that i value not the threatat the estimation of a fin of one of thesedead trouts and moreover i would haveyou to know that the champion who undervolii n the abbottakes the defence of every lady of bloodand birth whom men accuse of change offaith and of fashion is like to have enoughof work on his handsgo to said the seneschal but in atone of good humour thou art a foolishboy unfit to deal with any matter more seriousthan the casting of a net or the flyingof a hawk if your secret concern catherine seytonsaid the page i care not for it andso you may tell her if you will i wot shecan shape you opportunity to speak withher as she has ere nowthe flush which passed over douglas'sface made the page aware that he hadlighted on a truth when he was in factspeaking at random and the feeling thathe had done so was like striking a daggerinto his own heart his companion withoutfarther answer resumed the oars andpulled lustily till they arrived at the islandand the castle the servants received theproduce of their spoil and the two fishersthe abbot turning from each other in silence wenteach to his several apartmentroland graeme had spent about an hourin grumbling against catherine seyton thequeen the regent and the whole houseof lochleven with george douglas at thehead of it when the time approached thathis duty called him to attend the meal ofqueen mary as he arranged his dress forthis purpose he grudged the trouble whichon similar occasions he used with boyishfoppery to consider as one of the most importantduties of his day and when hewent to take his place behind the chair ofthe queen it was with an air of offendeddignity which could not escape her observationand probably appeared to her ridiculousenough for she whispered somethingin french to her ladies at which the ladyfleming laughed and catherine appearedhalf diverted and half disconcerted thispleasantry of which the subject was concealedfrom him the unfortunate page the abbotcivet of course as a new offence andcalled an additional degree of sullen dignityinto his mien which might have exposedhim to farther raillery but that mary appeareddisposed to make allowance for andcompassionate his feelingswith the peculiar tact and delicacy whichno woman possessed in greater perfectionshe began to sooth by degrees the vexedspirit of her magnanimous attendant theexcellence of the fish which he had takenin his expedition the high flavour andbeautiful red colour of the trouts whichhave long given distinction to the lake ledher first to express her thanks to her attendantfor so agreeable an addition to her tableespecially upon i jour che jeune and thenbrought on enquiries into the place wherethe fish had been taken their size their peculiaritiesthe times when they were in seasonand a comparison between the lochleventrouts and those which are found inthe lakes and rivers of the south of scottheabbot land the ill humour of roland giccraewas never of an obstinate character it rolledaway like mist before the sun and hewas easily engaged in a keen and animateddissertation about lochleven trout and seatrout and river trout and bull trout andchar which never rise to a lily and parwhich some suppose infant salmon andherrings which frequent the nith and venakisses which are only found in the castlewoodof lochmaben and he was hurryingon with the eager impetuosity and enthusiasmof a young sportsman when he observedthat the smile with which the queen atfirst listened to him died languidly away andthat in spite of her efforts to suppress themtears rose to her eyes he stopped suddenlyshort and distressed in his turn askedif he had had the misfortune unwittinglyto give displeasure to her grace no my poor boy replied the queen but as you numbered up the lakes andrivers of my kingdom imagination cheatedme as it will do and snatched me the abbotfrom these dreary walls away to the romanticstreams of nithsdale and the royaltowers of lochmaben o land which myfathers have so long ruled of the pleasureswhich you extend so freely your queen isnow deprived and the poorest beggar whomay wander free from one landward townto another would scorn to change fates withmary of scotland j your highness said the lady fleming will do well to withdrawcome with me then fleming said the queen i would not burthen heartsso young as these are with the sight of mysorrowsshe accompanied these words with a lookof melancholy compassion towards rolandand catherine who were now left alone togetherin the apartmentthe page found his situation not a little embarrassing for as every reader has expelpierced who may have chanced to be in sucha situation it is extremely difficult to maintainthe full dignity of an offended personthe abbot in the presence of a beautiful girl whateverreason we may have for being angry withher catherine seyton on her part satestill like a lingering ghost which consciousof the awe which its presence imposes ischaritably disposed to give the poor confusedmortal whom it visits time to recoverhis senses and comply with the grand ruleof damonology by speaking first but asroland seemed in no hurry to avail himselfof her condescension she carried it a stepfarther and herself opened the conversation i pray you fair sir if it may be permittedme to disturb your august reverieby a question so simple what may havebecome of your rosary it is lost madam lost sometime sincesaid roland partly embarrassed and partlyindignant and may i ask farther sir said catherine why you have not replaced itwith another i have half a mind shesaid taking from her pocket a string of ebonthe abbotny beads adorned with gold to bestowone upon you to keep for my sake just toremind you of former acquaintancethere was a little tremulous accent inthe tone with which these words were deliveredwhich at once put to flight rolandgraeme's resentment and brought him tocatherine's side but she instantly resumedthe bold and firm accent which was morefamiliar to her i did not bid you shesaid come and sit so close by me for theacquaintance that i spoke of has been stiffand cold dead and buried for this many aday now heaven forbid i said the page it has only slept and now that you desireit should awake fair catherine believe methat a pledge of your returning favour nay nay said catherine withholdingthe rosary towards which as he spoke heextended his hand have changed mymind on better reflection what should aheretic do with these holy beads that havebeen blessed by the father of the churchhimselfthe abbot roland winced grievously for he sawplainly which way the discourse was nowlikely to tend and felt that it must at allevents be embarrassing nay but hesaid it was as a token of your own regardthat you offered them ay fair sir but that regard attendedthe faithful subject the loyal and pious catholicthe individual who was so solemnlydevoted at the same time with myself tothe same grand duty which you must nowunderstand was to serve the church andthe queen to such a person if you everheard of him was my regard due and notto him who associates with heretics and isabout to become a renegado i should scarce believe fair mistresssaid roland indignantly that the vaneof your favour turned only to a catholicwind considering that it points so plainlyto george douglas who i think is bothkinsman and protestantthink better of george douglas saidcatherine than to believe and thenn the abbotchecking herself as if she had spoken toomuch she went on i assure you fairmr roland that all who wish you well aresorry for youtheir number is very few i believeanswered roland and their sorrow ifthey feel any not deeper than ten minutestime will cure they are more numerous and thinkmore deeply concerning you than you seemto be aware answered catherine butperhaps they think wrong you are thebest judge for yourself and if you prefergold and church lands to honour and loyaltyand the faith of your fathers why shouldyou be hampered in conscience more thanothers may heaven bear witness for mesaid roland that if i entertain any differenceof opinion that is if i nourish anydoubts in point of religion they have beenadopted on the conviction of my own mindand the suggestion of my conscience ay ay your conscience your contheabbot science repeated she with satiric emphasis'y your conscience is the scapegoat iwarrant it an able one it will bear the burthenof one of the bestmanorsof the abbeyof saint mary's of kennaquhair lately forfeitedto our noble lord the king by theabbot and community thereof for thehigh crime of

underespial and deputyturnkeyfor securing the person of his lawfulsovereign queen mary you misconstrue me cruelly said thepage yes catherine most cruelly godknows i would protect this poor lady at therisk of my life or with my life but what cani do what can any one do for her much may be done enough may bedone all may be doneif men will bebut true and honourable as scottish menwere in the days of bruce and wallace oroland from what an enterprize you are nowsoo the abbotwithdrawing your heart and hand throughmere fickleness and coldness of spirit how can i withdraw said rolandfrom an enterprize which has never beencommunicated to me has the queen orhave you or has any one communicatedwith me upon any thing for her servicewhich i have refused or have you notall of you held me at such distance fromyour counsels as if i were the most faithlessspy since the days of gallon and who said catherine seyton would trust the sworn friend and pupiland companion of the heretic preacherhenderson ay a proper tutor you havechosen instead of the excellent ambrosiuswho is naw turned out of house andhomestead if indeed he is not languishingin a dungeon for withstanding the tyrannyof morton to whose brother the temporalitiesof that noble house of god havebeen gifted away by the regent is it possible said the page j and isthe excellent father ambrose in such distressthe

indulge the course of his thickcomingfancies with least chance of interruptionbut his place of retirement wasin the present case ill chosen for he waspresently joined by master elias henderson i sought you young man said thepreacher having to speak of somethingwhich concerns you nearlythe page had no pretence for avoidingthe conference which the chaplain thus of the abbotfeared though he felt that it might prove anembarrassing one in teaching thee as far as my feebleknowledge hath permitted thy duty towardsgod said the chaplain there areparticulars of your duty towards man uponwhich i was unwilling long or much to insistyou are here in the service of a ladyhonourable as touching her birth deservingof all compassion as respects her misfortunesand garnished with even but toomany of those outward qualities which winmen's regard and affection have you everconsidered your regard to this lady maryof scotland in its true light and bearing i trust reverend sir replied rolandgraeme that i am well aware of the dutiesa servant in my condition owes to hisroyal mistress especially in her lowly anddistressed conditiontrue answered the preacher but itis even that honest feeling which may inthe lady mary's case carry thee into greatcrime and treacherythe abbot how so reverend sir replied thepage i profess i understand you noti speak to you not of the crimes of thisilladvised lady said the preacher theyare not subjects for the ears of her swornservant but it is enough to say that thisunhappy person hath rejected more offers ofgrace more hopes of glory than ever wereheld out to earthly princes and that she isnow her day of favour being passed sequesteredin this lonely castle for the commonwealof the people of scotland and it maybefor the benefit of her own soul reverend sir said roland somewhatimpatiently i am but too well aware thatmy unfortunate mistress is imprisoned sincei have the misfortune to share in her restraintmyself of which to speak sooth iam heartily weary it is even of that which i am about tospeaksaid the chaplain mildly but firstmy good roland look forth on the pleasantprospect of yonder cultivated plain you seewhere the smoke arises yonder village the abboting half hidden by the trees and you know itto be the dwellingplace of peace and industryfrom space to space each by the side ofits own stream you see the gray towers ofbarons with cottages interspersed and youknow that they also with their householdare now living in unity the lance hung up onthe wall and the sword resting in its sheathyou see too more than one fair churchwhere the pure waters of life are offered tothe thirsty and where the hungry are refreshedwith spiritual food what wouldhe deserve who should bring fire andslaughter into so fair and happy a scene who should bare the swords of the gentryand turn them against each other whoshould give tower and cottage to the flamesand slake the embers with the blood of theindwellers what would he deserve whoshould lift up again that ancient dagon ofsuperstition whom the worthies of the timehave beaten down and who should oncemore make the churches of god the highplaces of baal the abbot you have limned a frightful picturereverend sir said roland greene yet iguess not whom you would charge with thepurpose of effecting a change so horrible god forbid replied the preacher that should say to thee thou art the man yet beware roland graeme that thou inserving thy mistress hold fast the still higherservice which thou west to the peace of thycountry and the prosperity of her inhabitants else roland gramme thou mayest bethevery man upon whose head will fall thecurses and assured punishment due to suchwork ifthou art won by the song of these syrensto aid that unhappy lady's escape fromthis place of penitence and security it isover with the peace of scotland's cottagesand with the prosperity of her palaces andthe babe unborn shall curse the name of theman who gave inlet to the disorder whichwill follow the war betwixt the mother andthe son i know of no such plan reverend sir the abbotanswered the page and therefore can aidnone such my dirty towards the queenhas been simply that of an attendant it isa task of which at times i would willinglyhave been freed nevertheless it is to prepare thee for the enjoymentof something more of liberty said thepreacher that i have endeavoured to impressupon you the deep responsibility underwhich your office must be dischargedgeorge douglas hath told the lady lochleven that you are weary of this service andmy intercession hath partly determined hergood ladyship that as your discharge cannotbe granted you shall instead be employedin certain commissions on the mainlandwhich have hitherto been dischargedby other persons of confidence whereforecome with me to the lady for even todaysuch duty will be imposed on you i trust you will hold me excused reverendsir said the page who felt that anincrease of confidence on the part of thethe abbot lady of the castle and her family wouldrender his situation in a moral view doublyembarrassing one cannot serve two masters and i much fear that my mistress willnot hold me excused for taking employmentunder another dear not that said the preacher herconsent shall be asked and obtained i fearshe will yield it but too easily as hoping toavail herself of your agency to maintaincorrespondence with her friends as thosefalsely call themselves who would makeher name the watch word for civil war and thus said the page i will beexposed to suspicion on all sides for mymistress will consider me as a spy placed onher by her enemies seeing me so far trustedby them and the lady lochleven willnever cease to suspect the possibility of mybetraying her because circumstances put itinto my power to do so i would rather remainas i amthere followed a pause of one or twominutes during which henderson lookedvol ir o the abbotsteadily in roland's countenance as if desirousto ascertain whether there was notmore in the answer than the precise wordsseemed to imply he failed in this pointhowever for roland bred a page fromchildhood knew how to assume a sullenpetted cast of countenance well enoughcalculated to hide all internal emotions i understand thee not roland saidthe preacher or rather thou thickest onthis matter more deeply than i apprehendedto be in thy nature methought thedelight of going on shore with thy bow orthy gun or thy anglingrod would haveborne away all other feelings and so it would replied roland whoperceived the danger of suffering henderson'shalf raised suspicions to become fullyawake i would have thought of nothingbut the gun and the oar and the wild waterfowlthat tempt me by sailing amongthe sedges yonder so far out of flightshothad you not spoken of my going on shoreas what was to

the right path was my chiefdesire for coming hithertake care master henderson saiddouglas in a tone which seemed almostsarcastic lest you rush hastily on an adventureto which you have no vocation you are learned and know the adage neaceesseris in consilium nisi vocat whohath required this at your hand the master to whose service i am calledanswered the preacher looking upward he vho hath commanded me tobe earnest in season and out of season your acquaintance hath not been muchi think with courts or princes continuedthe young esquire no sir replied henderson but the abbotike my master knox i see nothing frightfulin the fair face of a pretty ladymy son said the lady of lochleven quench not the good man's zeal let himdo the errand to this unhappy princess with more willingness than i woulddo it myself said george douglas yetsomething in his manner appeared to con tract his words the minister went accordingly and demandingan audience of the imprisonedprincess was admitted he found her withher ladies engaged in the daily task of embroiderythe queen received him with that courtesy which in ordinary cases she jused towards all who approached her and the clergyman in opening his commissionwas obviously somewhat more embarrassedthan he had expected to be the goodlady of lochleven may it please yourgracehe made a short pause during whichmary said with a smile my grace wouldthe abbot in truth be well pleased were the ladylochleven our good lady but go on what is the will of the good lady of lochleven she desires madam said the chaplain that your grace will permit this younggentleman your page roland grme topass to kinross to look after some householdstuff and hangings sent hither for thebetter furnishing your grace's apartmentsthe lady of lochleven said thequeen uses needless ceremony in requestingour permission for that whichstands within her own pleasure we wellknow that this young gentleman's attendanceon us had not been so long permittedwere he not thought to be more at the commandof that good lady than at ours butwe cheerfully yield consent that he shall goonher errand with our will we would doomno living creature to the captivity whichwe ourselves must suffer ay madam answered the preacher and it is doubtless natural for humanitys the abbotto quarrel with its prisonhouse yet therehave been those who have found that timespent in the house of temporal captivitymay be so employed as to redeem us fromspiritual slaveryi apprehend your meaning sir repliedthe queen but i have heard yourapostle i have heard master john knox aim were i to be perverted i would willinglyresign to the ablest and most powerful ofheresiarchs the poor honour he might acquireby overcoming my faith and myhope madam said the preacher it is notto the talents or skill of the
