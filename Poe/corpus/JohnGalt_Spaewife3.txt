princes of the royal house of stuartand thus did their progenitor while intendingjusce and atonement work out against hisown offspring a machination of prerogativefraught with the seeds of irremediable enmityis it therefore to be wondered that therighteous heavens with an unparalleled constancyof displeasure have continued throughso long a succession of bloody and funerealevents to manifest their judgment on thedoomed and guilty race but not to expatiate on those old and earlycrimes let it suffice to say that althoughduring the remainder of king robert's dayshe partook of some calm and consolation inthe reflection of having atoned as far as hethen could to the fair and mild elizabethmure for the blight he had cast on her famethe pabwife and honour in the bloom of her youth

when i was in my novitiate at campuswe had a servitor of a solitary humourwho during the harvest time wardedin the bam and nightly slept there onemomii he told the abbot that he could notany longer abide in his service for that hehad several times seen a dead corpse in itswindingsheet straightened bedde him as helay alone in the bam by which tale theabbot was so moved and on account of thegreat trepidation of the man that he forthwithdisturbed him on the following year howevery when the mans dismay had passed offhe being delivered from his fears came backto us and was again hired for the harvest butone day he fell rom a stack of com that hewas helping to build and hang sorely hurt hewas taki to the bam and laid on the spotwhere he had formerly slept and there soonds the spaewifeafter he expired the vision he had seen beingthereby clearly proven to have been a warningto himself that we may have some inward intimationof the time of our own end said stuart is not to be questioned but

in his gravei could give many more proofs as incontestableas all dies but i think what is saidis enough to prove that there are mysteries inand about us which are not the more to bequestioned because they cannot be expounded and i marvel and admire that wise men andmen of lore and gifts should be so shy tobelieve that there are any visions of the kindwhereof i have spoken for what is morecertain

it was a pleasant afternoon and the greenventuredspring sat smiling in her arbour ofbudding wands and interwoven boughs withmany a sweet blossom in her lap and a youngbird on her finger which she was teaching tohop aid singwhile the king and his uncle the earlwere walking along sedately discoursing ofthe cares which then oppressed the royalmind and weighing in the scales of discreetreason the

spaewifea dog i will make the key keep the castleand the bush protect the cow but it adreadful thing that the first of my task shouldrequire such severity towards my own kin r is your majesty then really resolved tobring the prisoners to trial said athollwith a look that betokened some lataat purposein the question but the king not heedinghis manner for he esteemed his uncle beyondall his counsellors replied frankly is it not so decided can you doubtit give me leave to say my lord that iwas not altogether content with you taayhad the duke done nothing else than striptthe crown of the lands which he has squanderedon his partisans he had done enoughto deserve the heaviest punishment longmust the kingdom rue the consequences ofthe poverty that he has entailed on yourkings he has not left us the means to rewardthe fidelity of a menial how shall weeverbe able to keep in check the arroganceths pawif of a nobility so accustomed to rapine wehave nether the means to make it their

shouldthey be found guilty as i doubt not theymust it cannot be your majestys intention tobring them to punishment why not exclaimed the king surprisedat the remark do you think thatout of any consideration for the power of theirfriends or of any foe i shall be afraid to domy duty i but thought said athos humbly that as they are so near of kin to yourmajesty their lives might be spared they are not yet found guilty at leastaccording to law replied the king butjf they were justice knows not propinquity the spaewifethe proceedings against them however shallbe open and before all the world no manshall accuse mes in this stem business ofbeing actuated by malice or any other basemotive though the trial will perhaps bringdisgrace on our blood it shall yet be a proudthing for scotland and a glorious vindicationof her longadvised justicei cannot however but grieve for dukemurdoch said the earl with a sorrowfulcadence he is my coudn so is he mine interrupted the king and i grieve that he is so because he hasproved himself so bad a man and his vicewants the grace of bravery for it seems almostquestionable whether his weakness orwickedness is most in fault the nation mighthave pardoned his misrule but humanitycan never forgive the licentiousness in whichhe has indulged his sons as a kinsmanmy lord i have more cause to grievefor them than you for by their deaths ithe spaewife xan gain nothing which may not be obtainedby the forfeiture of their estates but you willcome so much nearer the thronethe countenance of the earl changed atthe observation and he looked troubled andcast down his eyes saying your majesty cannot suppose that anyconsideration of that kind would to melighten the thought of the sad destiny whichinevitably awaits so many friends he would have proceeded to say somethingstill more calculated to win the king'scharitable interpretation of the compassionwhich he had shown throughout for the misfortunesof the house of albany but just atthat moment anniple of dunblane rushedfrom behind ahoybush nigh to where theywere then standingking james was not only startled by thissudden obtrusion but filled with wonder atthe wildness of her small bright piercing eyes and his wonder grew to awe as she placed the spaewifeherself immediately before him and leaningwith both hands on a rude sapling whichserved her for a stamp gazed steadily at himfor some time and then looked round toatholl with an expression of pleasure soghastly chapel and yet triumphant that theking shuddered and hastily turned awayrom the contemplation of an object too hideousmystical and undaunted to be seen inthat mood without astonishment mingled withhorror she is a poor harmless naturalis saidthe earl observing the revolting effect whichshe had produced on the king but thecountry

extremewretchedness had arrested the kings attentionhe observed his emotion and said i wonder not she says so for the wholecountry cannot but sorrow that i am forcedto proceed so cruelly against so many thatshould have been my best friendsthe spaewife the earl was unable to answer or wasperhaps prevented by his surprise at the freedomwith which anniple went close to theking and raising his surcoat aside touchedhim on many parts of the body with herfinger what is this for said the king addingto the earl let her alone my lord i amnot afraid of any spells eightandtwenty bloody wounds i seethem all and the hands that bear the knives let me look at your's lord atholl exclaimedanniple and suddenly grasping himfirmly by the right wrist she looked at hishand and alternately at something aboutthe kingyours is not among them my lordand she dropt the hand carelessly at thatmoment two officers came hastily towardsthem and anniple darted away messengers said one of the officers have arrived from glasgow with tidings of th spaewifea rebellion in lennox headed by the lordjames stuart and the bishop of argyllwhat already in such power exclaimedthe king you see my lord athos howmuch our worthy kinsmen show themselvesdeserving of mercy this is the submissionyou and others undertook the lord jameswould send in but no mattersis quicknessin ill shall not outrun our justice letus return to the palace and call the counciltogether again it is demanded of us atonce to quench this treason and to bring theother traitors to their audit else the wild woemans prediction may be too soon fulfilledthe spaewife chap nilbot itwas not from the lord james stuartand bishop finlay only that the king hadcause to fear adversaries in arms against hisdetermination to administer justice withoutrespect of persons or of kin of all the adherentsof the house of albany there wasnot one of so bold a spirit as the sir robertgramme before spoken of and no soonerwas it known that he had made his peaceby submission and had been delivered fromdurance than he was expected to show himselfin his true colours and so it came topass for in the same hour in which he was releasedfrom custody he began to plan devicesand stratagems to revenge the wrong wiugivin his own notion he had sustained and alsopartly to show his gratitude for the manifest the spabwifbfavours which he had received at the handsboth of the regent robert and of dukemurdoch though a man of singular obduracy inhis lawless undertakings and ruthless boldand bloody beyond any other chieftain ofhis time yet sir robert held the virtues offriendship in such esteem that he used to say as it is the duty of all men to support the suffererin a just cause so in like manner is it theduty of friends to stand by one another bethecause of quarrel right or wrongshis first endeavours were directed toachieve the deliverance of the lord walterstuart from the bass where as it is alreadytold he had been sent on his arrest for secureward fmr the lord walter being a knightof undaunted valour in enterprise stout ofheart strong of dumb and dauntless in dangerit was thought no castle on the main land wasredoubtable enough to contain so subtle andintrepid a spiritthe spaeife gramme was chiefly moved to think first ofthe lord walter on account of his offenceagainst the king having been of a more openand daring description than the treasons imputedto his father and brothers many holychurchmen had besides accused him of riotousextortions and sacrilegious pillage and gentlemenof good ancestry charged him with irremediableoutrages in their familles moreover thepious lady abbess of the nunnery at northberwick had with her own pen written tobishop wardle of st andrews that it wasnot to be told what the lord walter stuartand his reprobate companions had perpetratedin her housebut as the bass stands far in the sea andis difficult of access from a boat save whenthe winds are propitious gramme was forsome time perplexed to know in what mannerhe could convey his mind and intents to theprisoner at last he bethought him of anexpedient very bold and perilous but the the spabwifkmore recommended to him by the bravery itdemandedhe hired at the south queensberry a faoiatand mariners purposing as he gave out topass thither to frail and thence to st andrewsin fulfilment of a vow which he hadmade in prison as if it was a thing within thecompass of chance that sir robert rkneshould have in sincerity ever any pilgrimageof piety to perform and having embarkedtherein the mariners spread the sidls livelybreeze was then blowing from the westwardand the boat rushed before the wind as if ithad been instinct with eagerness to reach herport but as she approached inch edtfagramme began to feign afraid of the waveshe that knew not what fear was and to picturerising blasts and raging seas such as no manin his right mind as he said ought that eveningto encounter by dint of which and exhortationsfollowing thereon he caused themariners to take shelter under the lea of thethe spaewife idondy m the hope that the wind would mthe ecmrse of the night abate for in vain didthey assure him there was no danger and representedths eirkcaldy was a safer havensince he was not content to continue his voyageunder the eastern cliff of inch keith theylay tin the sun was set and the lights on theshore and the stars in the tuft were kindledthe moon but four days old was setting inthe clouds over the pentlandhills and seemedas if she was trailing from the sea a longand rippled line of cold and watery light forthough sir robert gramme still would maintainthat the waves were too rough for hissmall bark to encounter the mariners sawthat they were but twinkling in the moonshinelike the wiping of a running riverwhen the moon had sunk behind the hillsand the land lay black between the restlesssea and the starry sky gramme ordered thesails to be again spread but when the maristhe spaewifenews as their course lay steered in towards thecoast of fife he rose in wellacted displeasureand accused them not only of having lost theirway but of making for the lothian coastthey protested that they could not be mistakenthat the darkness was not so thick butthey could discern the landmarks and beseechedhim to have confidence in their knowledgeand skillhe was not however to be appeased by theirprotestations on the contrary the more theycontroverted his opinion his anger waxed thefiercer and he insisted that if they would notgo on as he ordered they should returnthey told him it was then too late to returnfor the tide was drifting down but atlast by oaths and imprecations they were inducedto keep more out in a southerly courseto sea and towards morning the bass islegrey and dark was seen rising over the starboardbefore themgramme affected great alarm when he beheldthe spaewife the lofty rugged cliffs and heard the heavynoise of the dashing sea and of the cloudsof the cawing seabird that hovered aroundthe rocks and he sullenly inquired as onethat fears the name of the island to whichthey had betrayed himwhen they told him it was the bass he affectedfor a time a wild and fearful perplexitydaring alas what shall become of me have i been set free from the pleasant heightsof stirling but to be immured on these dolefulbocks p then he suddenly seemed torecollect himself saying but sir patrickwarburton the constable is a true and loyalknight i will tell him in what manner thismisfortune has come upon us steer thereforeto the landingplace i will crave his aidthe mariners well knew that there waseminent hazard to all who dared to approachthat prisonisle when there was any person ofdignity incarcerated there and again wouldfain have refused the order saying that the spaewifencmtth berwick was so hard by that he needednot to go to the bass mt only to starstraight to that port he however drewhis sword and wounded one of them in thearm for daring disobedience to his commandsafter the peril they had caused him to passand the jeopardy into which they had broughthim so the men became afraid and thinkinghe was not in his right mind ceased toreason with him but submitted themselves todo whatsoever he desired accordingly hehaving ordered them to make for the guidingthey lowered then sails and pled theiroars with great vigour and when the boatwas brought under the wall gramme made asad memorial to the guard of what he hadsuffered from his contumacious and unskilfulcrew entreating the soldier to inform the constablesir patrick warburton who he waswhence he had come and whither he wasgoing and to crave his hospitality until someother bark could be obtained to take him toth spabwife frail for farther than he had come be wcmldnot go save in stress of need with marinersso unpractised as he had found those to bewho had brought him thithersir patrick warburton on hearing thisplausible tale much commiserated the misadventureof the petitioner and came himselfto the port and very courteously invitedgramme to land telling him however thatfrom his orders he must of necessity hold himprisoner till he received instructions from thekingi know replied gramme that youcannot do otherwise and i am content to abidewith you it is indeed a thing not to bethoughtthat you sir patrick warburtonwould let me go free knowing as doubtlessyou do that i was so lately imprisoned on acharge of treason for as yet you cannothave heard of my pardonssir patrick was much won by this seemingfrankness of gramme and assured him that the spaewifethough he must hold him as a prisoner yetshould he be as free as himself and diet hewould do all things in his power to make himpleasant pastime tiu an answer came to thereport of the incident of his arrival am i then the only prisoner cm the rockthat you purpose to entertain me with suchfreedom p said grammeno replied sir patrick it is not so the lord walter stuart is herethe lord walter stuart i

walking in the garden with one ofher ladie and she immediately went to joinher there but as she approached the spotthe thought of what she had undertaken thefears and the doubts of the reception she mightmeet with for so far overstepping the modestyof maidenhood in applying as the declaredbride and advocate of an outlaw made herhesitate to advance for although queen jothesbaewlfe sflanna was of a null and gracious natureand much inclined by the gentleness of berown heart to entertain all solicitations of mercyand charity yet was she so strict and pure inthe decorum of her sex that'll returned fewfaults more rigidly than those which bytheir boldness seemed unbefitting the diffidencethat is so comely in womanat the time when the lady silnlla enteredthe garden her majesty was standing withthat renowned maiden and gentlewoman thefair katherine douglas and very gaily attiredas her custom ever was in order thatshe might by example teach the ladies anddames of the realm to acquire those habits ofcourtly manners which are put on with the garmentsof ceremony her goldai hair was gatheredwithin a net of pearls adorned with aspecious ruby and many a sapphire andemerald on her brow she wore a chaplet ofcet and white and blue feathers sprinkledall over wiui spangles and intermingled withxs the spaewifejonquilles and sprigs of broom around thefair enamel of her neck was a golden chinfrom which depended a ruby shapen like aheart which as it lay on the ivory of herbosom seemed as if a living fire had beentaken from the altar of true love and laid tobeam and glow in that beauteous place bythe one hand she held her robe of lustroussatin loosely up from the dewy grass andwith the other she leant upon the shoulder ofkatherine douglas smiling on the flowerstimidly peering from their buds as it were tosee if the spring was indeed come againa little page who accompanied the ladysibilla into the garden perceiving her hesitationwent forward and told the queen of herarrival and her majesty dropping the trainof her robe came quickly to meet her and takingher by the two hands not only preventedher from performing the accustomed homageof kneeling but kissed her in a sisterly manneron the cheek then drawing one of her handsthe spaewife gently through her arm she waved to katherinedouglas to retire and led her to a bower wherethey sat down together but notwithstandingall this tenderness and ardour sibilla was unableto speak till her heart was relieved by weepingat last encouraged by the soothing sisterlinessof the queen to break the business cmwhich she had returned to scone she relatedthe accident of her adventure at ballotand thence took occasion to remind her majestyhow natural it was for her to sorrowand deplore the ruin which impended overthe house of albany alas madame said she duke murdochis a man whose simplicity is his greatestfault he is without guile and altogetherdisposed to be harmleira and kind and goodand which is the better part of goodnessto think well of every body without advertingto their humour affection or presjudices he cannot have done ill but as aninstrument in the hands of others the spaewife then is theresa replied the queen theless cause to fear that he will suffer ans greaterpenalty than the arrest under which henow lies for it cannot be that were heundguilty the king would bring so near a kinsmanand so great a man in old age to anyheavier punishment so be not cast down onhis account but if your majesty knew the duchesssaid sibilla i have heard great things of that noblelady's replied the queen and i have marvelledthat she has never some to see me she is indeed exclaimed bibilla theparagon of mothers that she comes not tocourt is natural considering how she herselfwas so long all but in name the queen itmay be of the infirmity of our sex that sheis loath to appear less than she was albeiti do not think so bit rather that it proceedsfrom the very excellence of her characterknowing as she does that the dukethe spaewife from his easy nature may have fallen intofault and grieving for those things in bsoon which however old as the free usagesof the scottish nobles accord not with themilder customs that the king so labours toestablish she can have no heart to be atcourt where the show of that reverence whichher wisdom would instruct her to pay to hismajesty and your royal self might be consideredwith jealousy as assumed to win indulgencefor her children but were anygrace dispensed towards them i know fromthe warmth of her affections that the windswould be slow to the speed wherewith shewould seek to testify her gratitude by throwingherself at your majesty's feet then said the queen rest you assuredthat i shall not fail to urge the kingso to appease the rigour of justice as to bringspeedily such an ornament of womankind tohis oourtthe lady sibilla was for that time content the spaewifewith this assurance and their discourse beganto be of a less earnest kindknow you sibilla said the queen that our young kinsman the iord robertstuart nephew and heir to the earl of hollandwho has but lately for the first timecome to court speaks of you with the zeal ofa worshipper i would it might be sibillathat you were free to choose he is thehandsomest gallant that i have yet seen inscotland there is not one who either forcarriage spirit or courtesy may completewith him and not less highly bon than thesons of the duke of albanysibilla blushed and for a short time madeno reply then she said softly'does your majesty forget that i was betrothedto the lord james and that butfor this unhappy distraction of fortune whichhas driven him to such extremity we shouldhave been married i may not think of anyotherthe spaewife unay replied the queen it cannotbe that you should know the very excellentqualities of stuart and not prefer him thereis not a nobleman of his years whom theking so esteems as a companionssibilla again became thoughtful which thequeen observing took her by the hand andsaid i doubt not that his majesty could easilyobtain from the popes holiness a dispensationto dissolve the contract by which in nonageyou were so unfortunately betrothed to thelord james i am told that neither of hisbrothers no not even the libertine lordwalter is less deserving of your affectionhe is they say the fiercest and proudest ofthe three leave him to the issues of hisfate and think of what i have been tellingyou concerning the adoration of stuartsibillas bosom heaved with sorrowful sighsand the tears rushed into her eyes as she exclaimed the spaewife alas to what am i destined and sheshuddered and began to weep bitterlythe queen was much surprised to seesuch violence of grief but thinking it arosefrom the persuasion which sibilla had of thetruth of what she was saying of the lordjames she endeavoured to console her withthe assurance that the king would leave noinfluence untried to procure a dissolution ofthe contract oh it is not that which affects mescried sibilla with the sharp accents of miserybut suddenly exerting herself she dried hereyes and said i should have more pleasurein knowing that the duchess of albany anxietieswere softened by any grace to her familythan in being released from my bettotfamentto the lord jamesthe queen not perceiving the double senseof these words renewed the assurances of herbest and earliest endeavour to procure someabatement of the severe measures which werethe spaewife in process against the house of albany adding but come i have no will had i thepower to rule one so discreet and wise as mydear sibilla in any business of the heart letus therefore say no more of it at presentbut come to my chambersso saying the queen rose and taking herbythe hand led her to the gate and theyascended to the royal chamber where withthe other ladies of the court they spent theremainder of the day with the tuneful jingleof the virginal and melodious songs intermingledwith pleasant discourses the spaewifechap xxlwhisk the king had restored peace at dumbartonhe came to stirling where on thenight before the day appointed for the trialof his uncle the duke of albany with histwo sons and their maternal grandfather theearl of lennox he held a solemn council inthe castle at which the greatest and wisestmen then in all the realm met and a juryconsisting of twentyone peers was nominatedof whom the earl of atholl was the firstnamed being proposed by the king himself i implore your majesty said the alarmedearl when his name was mentioned notto put on me so invidious a

become presumptiveheir t the crownall present applauded this speech andseemed to expect that the king would consentto dispense with the service of the earlat the trial but his majesty replied no my lord athos what you objectbecomes that fame for wisdom which you enjoyin the world but this awful business requiresthe assertion of an honour above theworld in so much as you act as you willdo with no respect for the opinions of menbut only for truth will your name and renownbe exalted and spread abroad thetask that i call on you to perform is fraughtwith an immensity of glory for there hasnot been from all the eras of history sos th spaewifemagnificent a vindication of law and justiceas that which with the favour of heaven wehave undertaken to see doneethe peers and prelates around the counciltable were smitten with wonder at the voiceand manner with which the king spoke andthe earl rose up and solemnly laying hishand on his bosom bowed in reverential silenceto his majesty and again slowly satdown when the king added it is our intention to preside in personand on the throne with crown and sceptrethe condition of the prisoners and the greatnessci the occasion demand it no manwith less than the dignity royal should sitin judgment on a prince who has like theduke administered the royal trust andwho is there that might not be suspected ofbeing factiously swayed against his gracesfriends and family when it is considered thatthe king has declared himself the avenger ofall such crimes and offences as those wherethespaewiffi with they are charged and shall moreoverby the forfeitures that may ensue from theircondemnation be so enriched with the meansto reward subserviency thus it was determined that not onlyshould the king preside at the trial and theearl of athos be at the head of the jurybut that the jury itself should consist chieflyof noblemen attached by interest and gratitudeto the party of the prisoner so anxiouswas his majesty that the world should neverhave cause to impugn the stem sublimity ofhis justicebut though the earl of athos had in sodutiful a manner submitted to the kingscommand before the council his heart wasmuch troubled and when he retired to hislodging in the town where his lady was heappeared overcast with thought and care farbeyond his habitude the which had for sometimebefore been singularly reserved and melancholia the

to withhold from methe confidence and love that we once and solong enjoyed together it is impossible replied the earl thati should not be disturbed by those feuds anddemonstrations of rebellion which so distractthe country our young king lacks in thethe spaewife discretion which should be possessed with authorityhe makes his power felt by itspressure and bears himself onward in theestablishing of laws which by being writtenhe regards as superior to the fluctuating wisdomof common opinion without consideringwhether the spirit of the age goes along withhim he is like a warship that sails in

which has won for you soeminent a namethe earl made no immediate answer butthe spaewife paced the chamber thoughtfully with hishands behind if resumed the countess the taskhe has put upon you be greater than you feelin yourself the power to accomplish i pray you my lord not to be enticed by any fantasywhatsoever to persevere in its'the thing itself said the earl with aseeming carelessness would not trouble me but who knows what the world may think ah my dear lcmd cried the countesspassionately if you did not suspect yourselfyou would not so stand in awe of theworld i do by our long cohabitation andfaithful love implore you not to embark inthis business since it is so equivocal to yourconsciencewhat do you mean what would youimply exclaimed the earl startled by herobservation oh nothing nothing i what should iimply derogatory to your honour said the the spaewifecountess and the tears rushing into hereyes she wept very bitterlyi shall grow angry at such peevishnessmargaret de barclay said the earl youallow yourself to become fantastical andwith a paying jealousy alike unworthy ofyourself and of me you put a false and unfavourablecolouring on my best intentionsgood heavens you would insinuate that iam plotting for the extinction of the whole ofduke murdoch's line though all the worldknows that i alone of the council opposedmyself to the proceedings which have nowarrived at such a portentous maturityi do not blame you my lord repliedthe afflicted lady with a mournful voice but i fear that your honour is in greatjeopardy alas i can only pray that itmay with yourself escape the risks to whichit is exposedthe earl made no answer to this kindejaculation but retired from the room andthe spaewife went straight to the chamber in the castlewhere the king was sitting alone pensivelylooking over the wide landscape that spreadstowards all the west and after some interchangeof courtesies becoming their respectiveconditions and made flexible by theirrelationship and his majesty's favour theydiscoursed of the deliberations of the dayand the impending solemnity of the morrowi fear said the earl speaking of theprisoners that they must all be foundguilty but your majesty will not teach theirreverent world such a dreadful lesson asthat the sacred rank of princes may be subjectedto the ignominy of a public execution if they are found guilty of the crimeslaid to their charge i will confirm the sentencesreplied the king gravely i darenot pardon them were i to be swayed by myinclinations in this case and unjustly usemercy what offender in scotland would hereafterin receiving punishment be considered the spas wifeotherwise than as the victim of a partialityfannythe earl did not immediately make anyanswer but after a short rumination hesaid in those eastern countries where wisdomand light have their fountainhead it is saidthat when illfated or guilty princes are condemnedto die no axe is ever stained withtheir good but at the dead of night asolemn sound is heard pealing through thesilence all then asleep start from their bedsand listening at their windows hear afieur offthe dark and heavy plunge of anne awfulthing cast into the seasthe king looked austerely at this uncleand replied i trust to heaven my lordthat i shall ever be preserved from the practiceof any usage which makes justice so muchlike crime therefore urge me no more butlet all things be done openly and before theeyes of god and man so that the purity ofthe spaewife our conscience may be discerned in the clearnessof our actionswith this he went and sat down agdn inthe oriel window where he was sitting whenthe earl entered and the latter came awaysomewhat discomposed by the rebuke whichhe had received but seemingly not inwardlymuch disturbed that his majesty shouldbe so resolved to let the law take its courseagainst their delinquent kinsmen the spaewifechap xxiiin the meantime the lady sibilla abidingwith the queen at scone saw and heardday after day that no entreaty nor supplicationcould move the king from his stemintent to vindicate the laws of the realmand the regal authority and the hope whichshe had cherished of obtaining by the mediationof her royal mistress some remission ofhis severity began in consequence to waneand fade and her spirit was overcast withsadness and despondencyshe however still thought that offendedjustice would be appeased with the sacrificeof one victim and she was almost contentwhen she heard that the lord walter was tobe brought first to trial she augured therefromthat as it was the opinion of all men hethe spajewife could not be tried without being condemnedthe king would be satisfied with asserting thesupremacy of the law over him only in respectto those notour treasons and offenceswherewith he was charged accordingly forseveral days before the time appointed for thetrial she refrained from soliciting the queensfavour and influence either for her fugitivelover or for any of the prisoners awaitingthe issue under clouds of dread and terrorit is true but not so black in their darknessas to shut out every star of hopethe singular constancy of mind withwhich that delicate lady in the interval resistedall enticements to pleasure and pastimewon the admiration of the whole court for the motives and causes of her abstinencewere well known and the ill success whichhad attended her endeavours awakened commiserationand sympathy in every gentle andreligious bosom it began however to beremarked that her beauty was suffering als tale spaewifechange and that instead of the bloom andgaiety which was wont to beam in her eyeand smile on her cheek the harsh aspect ofresentment uke the shadow of a cloud on thesummer fields often lowered in sternnessand that her voice lost the sweet melody ofpersuasion and became harsh with the accentsas it were of reproach and commandin vain did the countess of ross who hadby this time returned to sooone chide herfrowardness and beseech her to retire for aseason to some secluded bower especially asshe had so openly declared her determinationnot to go back to the castle of her father tillthe destiny of her betrothed lover was decidedby the impending fate of his father andbrothersbut what most drew the wonder of thecourtiers and the ladies was the manner inwhich amidst all her anxieties and visible sorrowshe comported herself towards the younglord robert stuart after his return fromthe spaewife dumbarton whither he had gone with theking against the lord jamesas often as he approached towards her shewas seen to shudder and become pale butalmost in the same moment by some escortingof inward fortitude her countenancewas whitened and she welcomed him withthe apparent pleasure of one solicitous ofvardthe queen observing this marvelled thereatand also that sibiua at no time nor onany occasion spoke to stuart of the unfortunatecondition of the princes of the houseof albany but seemed as it were with asingular solicitude to avoid all discourse andcontroversy of conversation concerning themwith him yet notwithstanding it wasplain to her majesty as well as to othersthat she did some constraint to her ownnature in the affable carriage with whichshe demeaned herself towards stuart evenstuart himself admiring her with the fervencys the spaewifeof a fond and young enthusiasm felt thatthere was something in her manner whichwhile it flattered yielded him no delightwhen he was most ardent and emulous toevince the sentiments with which he wasanimated she listened with attention but itwas as if she endured some penalty of thespirit yet there were times when she wouldas it were wave over him the gracious enchantmentof her happiest graces and makehim fancy that his affection was almost returnedif she looked cold and retired from hisimpassioned advances he felt abashed andmortified and in the eclipse of hope whichtook place on such occasions he rememberedwith something like boding and dread theadmonition of the spaewife with respect tothe influence that a lady was to exercise overhis destiny but when she wreathed hersmiles and charms as it were into a cordedgarland wherewith he was too happy to bethe spaewipe fettered he pondered and dreamt but of herand worshipped no other saintmany however thought that both in thefrowns and the favours by which sibilla sosubdued stuart to become her declaredknight and servitor she was actuated bysome deeper motive than the feminine desireof supremacy and perhaps it was that edid discern qualities in his character whichshe thought might prove of avail in someeventual and contingent purpose especiallyas none of all the young nobles enjoyed somuch of the kings familiar regard or sharedso freely in his pastimes and exercises of recreationbut time was running on and the dayappointed for the trial being come the queenand her gentlewomen in the evening satlovingly in unison endeavouring with theirmelodious lutes and virginals and the pithiermusic of discreet discourse to sooth sibillafrom the melancholia ruminations with the spaewifewhich she was all that day depressed andit came to pass while they were so engagedin the royal chamber that stuart enteredhastily to tell the queen that a messengerhad arrived from stirling with the result ofthe lord walter's trialin coming into the room he chanced notto observe sibilla among the ladies for thesetting sun so caused the purple and goldenhues of the heraldries emblazoned on thewindows to fall as it were with the sprinklingsof a shivered rainbow upon all thingsin the chamber that nothing therein could be distinctly seen at the first glance and hebean to tell that the lord walter had beenfound guilty of the offences laid to his chargeand that he was immediately condemned todie and had been forthwith executed on thecastlehill to the amazement of the peoplethese sad tidings though not more terriblethan her fancy had long prepared sibillto expect so smote her heart that she sfawif ussitered a feeble cry and sunk down upon thefloor in a swoon from this sorrowful syncopeshe was however speedily recovered bythe rationally of cold water and the momentthat she could again speak she inquiredwith a piercing sadness what was tobe done with the other prisoners alas r said stuart while he hung overher himself almost insensible with anguishand horror at the fearful accident he hadcaused by his rashness alas said hethey are to be brought to trial tosorrow's then they too exclaimed sibilla areno less assuredly the victims of this inflexiblesternness in saying which she made a strongeffort to shake off the languor of her trance and rising from the laps and arms of theladies she suddenly quitted the chamberthe queen whose gentle nature was greatlymoved by her sorrow followed her hastilyinto another room and began to offer many the spaewifekind and tender suggestions to mitigate heraffliction to all which she only saidei will this night go to the king himselfthis work is too horrible i no measure ofjustice can require the sacrifice of a wholerace it is but the wrath of heaven thatdemands in one sacrifice so many victimshitherto i have implored the beneficent mediationof your majesty to obtain some ray ofthe royal mercy for these unfortunate princesbut i will now speak to the king in anotherstrainthe queen was surprised at the manner inwhich the lady sibilla thus delivered herselffor there was no tone of grief in theaccent of her voice nor any shadow of sorrowon her countenance but a serene solemnitymanifested alike in the lofty elevation ofher speech the calm of her eye and the majesticalfirmness of her carriage i do not oppose your resolution sweetcousin said her majesty after a short pausethe spaewife and thoughtful interval but i would remindyou whether such intrepidity in behalfof the house of albany may meet the approbationof your own friends it is a new thingfor one so young to step so forward it is a new thing replied sibilla tobehold an illustrious line of princes doomedto be cut oif on the ignominious scaffold andam not i involved in their fate by the strongestof all ties by the affection that i wasencouraged to cherish an obligation withwhich heaven itself united us i feel as adaughter and sister of the prisoners shouldfeel and as such i am irresistibly impelled tostand forward in the thoroughfare of thedeath and desolation that are rushing in amanner so terrible upon them my endeavoursmay in nothing avail the victims buti am the only friend that dares to adventureany expedient endeavour in their behalfthe vehemence with which this was saidaffected the queen's heart with a sorrowful the pabwifeanguish and her majesty refrained from offeringany further remonstrance but only hgave orders to the officers of her chamber tosee due preparations made for the conveyanceof the lady sibilla forthwith to stirlingand she specially enjoined stuart and other igallants of the court to be of her guard andcompanythe spaewipb chap xxiiiit was the grey morning before that mournfullady reached the castlehill of stirlingwhere she alighted from her palfrey and ascendedinto the inner ward

assembled and theearl was so startled and surprised at beholdingher thee at that hour leaning on the arm ofstuart that he could make no reply whenshe entreated hin to conduct her even thendishevelled

her resolution soon overcamethat hesitation of maiden diffidence in so muchthat when he passed by she met the surprisewith which he gazed on her as if dbe knewhim not or was so rapt in some high contemplationas not to be sensible to the transitorypageant then moving before herher eyes were intensely fixed on the king vol i m the spaewiand as he drew near she cast herself at hisfeet so

the everlasting clasps of thebook of life the king moved by the tenderness of thispiteous advocacy seemed for a moment torelent from his stem sublimity but at thatjuncture a solemn peal from the trumpetswithout recalled him to the awful sense ofhis regal task and he laid his hand on hisheart and bowing his head to the suppliantmoved mournfully and slowly to the hall ofjudgment the spaewifechap xxivthe trial lasted all day during which thelady sibilla afflicted with ef and fearand many a fiery sting of despair sequesteredherself in an upper chamber of the castle inaccessibleto all but her maidens whomever and anon she sent to inquire how thecourt was proceedingsometimes she received for answer thatthe witnesses prevaricated and that it wasthought the prisoners would be assoilziedat others the poor damsels returned weepingand sat down beside her in silence and thenher heart beat audibly and she spoke not tothem till after a season had passed when shebade them go and inquire againin this mournful condition the day passedand the shades of evening began to fall andthe spaewife still she had received no assurance to herhopes nor were her fears darkened deeperthan in the morning in the gloom howeverof the twilight a rustling was heardamong the multitude that covered in clustersall the castlehill and the sound oftrumpets soon after announced that the sessionwas ended and that the king was returningfrom the hallon hearing this noise and clangour sibillarose from her seat and rushed towards thedoor but in the same moment as if she hadbeen arrested by some invisible hand shesuddenly stopped and looked round andgasped with horror her maidens ran to herassistance but she fluttered her hands atthem and cried go go they knewthat she desired but to learn the issue of thetrial and they hastened out of the roomwishing that they might obtain some encouragingtidings but they did not returnthe twilight was now fading away ands the spaewifesave a deep and solemn murmuring from thewaves and movements of the multitude withoutsilence clothed with the shadows of nightstole from the lonely mountains into the hamletsof the social valleysin the meantime sibilla had retired intothe obscurest corner of the chamber and satdown but though thirsting to know thedoom of the prisoners her will was fetteredas with the incubus of the nightmare andher spirit appalled with fantasies more dismalthan the unblest imaginings of a guilty conscienceand she remained as still as an alabastereffigy on a tombin this woeful state she heard a universalrustle from the multitude as if a suddengale had passed over the leafy boughs ofa wide forest the aught of a torch from thecourt below then flashed against the ceiling ofthe room a low and smothered noise andwhispering arose and a sound of many feetmoving slowly onward she listenedthespaewife sthat moment the tolling of a bell made herstart from her seat she rushed to the windowe could discern nothing distinctly butthere were torches and soldiers and spearsglimmering and here and there a face fearfullybrightened by the glare of the torches yetshe could see that all was moving forwardlike the waters of the river's tide in the darknessand solemnity of the night and anonshe beheld in the gloom a sullen and terribleform walking alone as if eschewed by alland his arms were bare to the shoulder andhe carried a gleaming axe then came ayouth of a noble air and haughty carriagewhom she soon discovered to be the lordalexander he too was alone and thesoldiers that lined the way followed him withadmiring eyes as he passed the next thatcame was duke murdoch leaning on thearm of bishop wardle and they passedand then there was a void for some timebut soon a mournful breathing of compassionm

a crucifixcoming totteringly forward it was the agedearl of lennox accompanied by a priestwhose arm he grasped for support as withfeeble and faltering steps he passed slowlyalongsibiua was so melted by the sad sightthat she wrung her hands and ran into thefarthest comer of the chamber and wept andwhen the violence of this grief abated shereturned to the window and opened the casementand listened with an eager ear all wassilent then a low murmuring rose from themultitude beyond the walls again there was asudden silence and then she heard the fall ofa heavy stroke an awful moan followed andthe echoes that dwell in the abbeycrags andin the valley and the cliffs of daniel sulkspaewife lely responded to the sound then a dreadfulvoice made proclamation of some terribleevent but the tenour thereof she could nothear nor was there any responsethe bell tolled again and again there wassilence and a second stroke fell more heavilythan the first and the dreadful voice againmade proclamationagain the bell tolled and then there was arushing sound as of parting waters in themidst of which sibilla heard the deathaxefall a third time but when the voice of theexecutioner began again to make proclamationa shriek so wild so howling and so fulluf sorrow arose from the multitude that shefelt as if the very earth shuddered at thesound and swinging powerless from her holdsank to

raised his left bandfrom the table at which he was sitting as if hehad been startled by the proposal but suddenlysubduing the surprise of the momentbe replied no my good uncle that were too muchas you

with his brethren heperform the obsequies tonight as if he knewonly of the rank and nothing of the offenceof the deceasedthe earl had been so overtaken by thequickness of the king's amaze at his suggestionthat he stood somewhat rebuked whilehis majesty was speaking in so much thatthe king thinking his command to the abbotof cambuskenneth was deemed not enough toensure a becoming pageant added

removedas a prisoner from her pleasant inlaid palaceat falkland to the strong rewarded fortaliceof pantaloon for it was thought by all menthat her high mindedness would not patientlysuffer such an entire dilapidation of her housebut would prompt her to stir up the friendsof her lord and her father to attempt some enterpriseof rescue or intimidation the apprehensionhowever of the machinations

sadness as she sawafar off the brightening summit of the nountain at the foot of which stood the towers offalkland that home which had been whitenedby the innocency of her children and whichwith them she was destined never to beholdagainall day she was by fits touched as it werewith frenzy still in the midst of those fearfulpangs the fortitude of her spirit neverdeparted and when the tear was shed andthe shock over she appeared as august andserene as if neither the alarms of a daughterthe spaewife a wife nor a mother had any dominion withinher bosom and she sat at the window ofher chamber in the western tower and beheldthe sun set and the evening close andthe stars lighted up and the moon arise calmlyawaiting the consummation of her fate butstill no messenger came and still the hopethat wrestled with her and would fly awayshe continued to detain with a fond and endearingstruggle at last soon after midnightthe sound of a buglehorn was heard atthe gate it made her start from her seatwith the intent of rushing to the warder'stower to hear who at that time sought admissionbut ere she had half way passedacross the floor she checked her precipitationand returning sedately to her seat desiredher gentlewoman to order candles tobe brought in for till that occurrence shehad all the evening remained without anyother light than the moonbeams through thecasement the spaewifescarcely had the menial in attendanceplaced the lights on the table when the captainof the castle entered and said that aherald had arrived from stirling and demandedadmission the captain though anaustere old shorter faultered as he deliveredthe message and avoided her eyes give him admittance i have longedfor his comings exclaimed the duchess risinghastily let him come in let himcome in whatever his tidings or his officemay bethe captain turned quickly round andhastened out of the room her gentlewomanwho had observed his emotion retiredto a comer and sat down but the duchesscontinued standingafter a brief interval the captain returnedwith the herald who trembled exceedinglyas he approached towards her with a letter inhis hand she saw the paper and snatchedit eagerly from him but instanter the fortithespaewife wtide of her spirit recovered its firmness andwithout breaking the seal she walked deliberatelyto the candlethe herald who had knelt down to presentthe letter at the moment when she tookit from him continued on the floor andseemed wrapt with amazement when he beheldher open it and peruse it without trepidation it is all over now said the duchesswhen she had read the fatal intelligencethey have all suffered the sentence of thelaw a slight flutter moved her kerchief asshe said these words but she laid the letteron the table and turning to the herald whohad risen from his kneeling she added witha struggling voice if they deserved to dietheir doom was just sir have you anyother business here the herald was unable to make any replybut bowed as one that is before the hallowedshrine of some glorious martyr and retiredvol i n the spaewifefollowed by the captain who seemed in hasteto quit the room but before leaving it heturned round and for a moment looked at her grace with scarcelyless than religious reverence and then hurried awaythe duchess still they were gone movednot from the spot where she was standingnear the table but when the door was shutand none present but her gentlewoman sheraised her hands distractedly and with thewildest note of desolate misery cried godhelp me and rushed into an inner roomthe spaewife chap xxviiit came to pass some time after the dolorousevents whereof recital has been madethat the king summoned the states of thereahn to parliament at perth and thitherrepaired sir robert gramme the fiercest adherentof the faction of the house of albanyhe grudged the frustration of his design forthe deliverance of the lord walter fromthe bass isle as if it had been to himself aninsolent taunt or a galling injury and hisdread of the kings justice was as a spurto his revenge in so much that he ponderedby night and by day in what manner toratify a resentment that blood only couldquench yet though thus borne onward tocrime by the incitements of destiny he wasnevertheless deterred from immediate venges the spaswifkonce by considerations of interest for evenin his wildest and worst passions this remorselessconspirator ever had respect to his estateit is true that the trials and execution ofthe princes smote him with amazement but itsoon passed away and like the violent flamethat bursts forth after the brief damping ofoil cast upon the fire the fiend which possessedhim raged fiercer than everat perth he met with many of the baronagemalcontent with the strict enforcementof the royal authority which hampered themin their feuds and forays and their otherhasty administrations of redress in their ownspecialities and finding them in this moodhe began afar off to work upon their distemperedmindsthis method of rule he was wont tosay which king james has learnt from ourold enemies the english may not in itselfi am free to acknowledge be wrong nay idoubt not it accords passing well with thethe spaewife humour of those for whom it was contrivedibr with them charters and statutes have theauthority of rights and justice but it suitsneither our usages nor the temperament ofscottish blood the english at any timewill rather seek another's help than servethemselves and hence it is that they sotamely leave their wrongs to the adjudicationsof judges and juries but it is the natureof every free and trueborn scot to dohis own business and accordingly from theoddest times of the monarchy our kings havenever had leave to meddle with the jurisdictionsof the chiefs and barons in verity ishould be glad to know how a travelling manof law going from town to town with a bookunder his arm like a pedlar can see into thedeservings of illdoers so well as the lordthat lives among them and knows their habitand is familiar with their repute bysuch jurisprudence i grant that the act ofwrong may be well enough sifted but is it thejustice that the doer diereaf should only bepunished for that particular act however hadus foigooe conduct may hare been fairmy part i think the kings prerogativeshould be upheld in au things but i donot discern why it is that he has been so loadvisedas to treat his nobles as if they wereall alike and take from us the sword evenin our own defences when he may go to warwith the english or any other crown shallwe say to him he dmuld not and are notourchiefs and barons with respect to oneanother as free to act as kings who are butbarons with a greater vassalage howevernot to speak of that which may be wrongfullyrepeated to our prejudice iriio can telwhat will ensue by this new way of takingsubsidies i do not say that king jameshath any ill intent in enriching his treasuryby taxes but if a king have money enoughto keep orders independent of the serviceof his vassals what man of any degree canthe spaewif then brag of freedom or call aught his ownwhether the thing be life limb or land by title discourses of this bearing he sobeguiled them to his will that in the endthey appointed him to remonstrate with theking against the inroads that were daily madeon their ancient privileges i shall not shrink in the task said he but then you must be prepared to back myendeavour for i doubt not the king willill brook the representation and we all knowif he call it treason it is but another wordfor death now i am not a man that willbe worried like a rabbit i will stand todanger whatever it may be and i care notwhat life may perish in defending my ownit is therefore needful to be prepared forthe worst and i should remind you that theearl of athos who has been always heartand hand with the king in this newfangledgovernance can never be a fit person to the spaewifename for the regency should our adventurecome to that extremitythus all things were duly concerted forexecuting at the opening of parliamentwhat had been in this manner determined but when the king appeared on the thronegramme transported with a sudden sting ofire and malevolence forgot the policy he waspledged to follow and rushing upon his majestycried aloud i arrest you sir in the name of the threeestates of the realm here assembled for asyour people have sworn to obey you so areyou constrained by an equal oath to governthem cording to their laws and customsand in saying this still grasping the king'sarm he turned round and said to the baronsand prelates there present is it not theftas i say but evi those of his own faclion were so struck with consternation at hisrashness and so awed by the serenity whichthe king preserved that they had not heartthe spaewife to give him any demonstration of encouragement take him to prison said his majestycalmly and he was thereupon seized by thearms and carried away bitterly upbraidingthe dastards for whom he had adventured sodaringly the business of the session thenproceeded as if no such bold treason hadbeen attempted and when it was ended hismajesty having retired to his closet sent forthe earl of athos to confer with him concerningthe outrage i can discover said his majesty whenthe earl was come before him that the austerityof our impartial administration hasgalled many among you else this audacioussir robert gramme would not have venturedto lay hands on the king in parliamentnow as the end of all government should beto cherish goodwill among the subjectsthere must be some lack of policy if not ofjustice in the rigour of our proceedings therens the spaewifefare let ns speedily j redress the grievance iwill pardon grseme for by the bravery ofhis attempt he matched himself ast wereonly with me and since he was none secondedi shall not let it be searched whether orno he had any abettors it may perhaps be as your majesty says but an outrage so flagrant is beyond pardonif however the mercifulness of your owngracious nature plead for him surely it willbe enough to let him have his life the veryleast that can be meted to him is banishmentand the forfeiture of his estates to so bold and bad a man as i haveheard even you my lord describe sir robertgrseme such a punishment would only be asalicense and warrant to work nusdnef it may be replied the earl that i havespoken of him in heat for he has ever been themost turbulent of the albany faction buthowever that may have been it is not to bethoughteven though your majesty be coni'vespaewife stent to pardon the insulting treasm done toyourself that the states will overlook thebreach of their own privilegesthe king remained for several minutesruminating and silent and then saidethis affair troubles me i cannot altogetherpardon gramme without giving offenceto many of the nobility and yet he is a manof such a nature or i mistake the indicationsof character that any measure of punishmenthowever small will become with him a motivefor vengeance i would either deal with himgently or not spare him at alleifs replied the earl such be yourmajestys sentiment and you are not movedin the business by any consideration of yourown but only as the matter may effect thepublic weal let the lesser punishment be triedfor whatever impression it may make ongramme himself your royal clemency cannotftdl to prove most salutary upon others asi doubt not there are abettors of his treason the spaewifewho at this moment tremble for themselvesthey will be glad to find their heads safe bythe leniency shown to him were he entirelypardoned they would suspect it was donebut to gain time till their whole plot wasfound out there is something like reason in whatyoa say my lord and i will remit the matterinto your hands and yet i know nothow it is but i am not satisfied in compromisingany point of policy with such a daringoffender as sir robert gramme and so sayinghis majesty retired to his chamber andthe earl coming away through the cloistermet bishop wardle to whom he rehearsedwhat had passed between him and the kingknowing that his majesty would probably ofhis own accord tell him i do almost lament said the bishop that your counsel in this case has prevailed and yet i would not have the traitor pardonedfor i know him well i know him bythe spabwifb a confession which he once made to me whilehe was yet a mere youth scarcely beardedconfession did i call it a bravery ratherof crimes the subtile adder has not moreskill in finding venom to supply the malice ofher bite than that dreadful man in discoveringfit means and instruments for his atrociouspurposesthe earl made no answer to this butseemed so thoughtful that the religious pekte recollecting his consanguinity to grammeendeavoured to soften the harsh opinion whichhe had thus indignantly deliveredyou are mistaken my lord bishopsaid the earl i am not troubled by whatyou have told me but i dread to think thata spirit so implacable should be set at largegoaded with the sense of punishment it is not too late ta have him brought totrial and condemned said the bishopthe earl gave a short shudder of revolt as the spaewtfeit were at this but in a moment he repliedsedatelythough i know gramme to be themost daring and dangerous man at this timewithin the realm of scotland yet it cannotstand with the king's honour to changein his purpose towards him banishment andthe forfeiture of his goods is the sentence thatwill be executedin advising that said bishop wardle you have incurred a fearful responsibilityto this the earl made no answer andthe bishop discerning that what he had saidcaused displeasure parted from him nextday when the states again assembled in parliamentsentence was recorded against grammeas the earl of athos had suggested but insteadof going into banishment he was nosooner set free of custody than he retired intothe wildest highlands and gave himself uptowrath and revengethe spaewife soschap xxviiixse evening soon after the daring adventureof the traitor gramme as the king was sittingalone in his closet pondering of his royal trustsand the ordure that his name might have withposterity he called sir william chrichton thechancellor before him a man richly endowedwith wisdom grave temperate and yet withalof an urbane disposition and said to him there is a mission of charity sir williamchrichton in which i would fain havethe help of your good offices the forlornestate of that noble lady the duchess ofalbany is a thing that lies very sore uponme whatever were the faults and offeiicefiof her father her husband and her sonsverily she has had cause for great sorrow and though justice might not mitigate the the spaewifemisfortunes that she hath borne yet pitywill constrain us to lighten to the utmost thegrief wherein she sits so disconsolate i prayyou therefore sir william go to her andnot only set her free from pantaloon but undertakefrom me to restore to her whatevershe may desire of the lands and heritage ofher family i give all to your wisdom anddiscretion to act and to do for me as youwould wish to see done by one who wouldearn without the abatement of any presentduty the guerdon of an honourable renownhereaftersir william chrichton did not make anyimmediate response to this command but remainedthoughtful for some time in so muchthat the king addedam grieved sir william that you taketime to consider of this compassionate matteryou do not think in wishing to soften the rigorousadversity that afflicts the duchess ithereby manifest aught which the invidiousthe spaewife world might in its malice or envy impute tomeas an acknowledgment of having donewrong nos replied the chancellor far befrom me the thought that your majesty canbe swayed in any good or just or kind intentby the awe of those who look invidiously evenon the virtues of princes but after the terribletask of justice which your majesty has achievedit is meet to be considered whether thetime for remission and indulgence be yetcome the duchess of albany is a ladyfamed for an august spirit and a masculineunderstanding fit it is said for the rule andsovereignty of a kingdom what has befallenher family cannot but have struck sharply andsorely into her heart and of a necessity itwould seem she must bear against your majestyan ireful and implacable mind for it isthe very nature of ill fortune to stir up thoseevil qualities in ourselves which but for adversitymight have slept unknown like thes the paewifkfoul toad that lurks under the flower and is notangered till themowers scythe hath woundedhis back moreover your majesty would dowell to call to mind that her outlawed son thelord james still lives and threatens whathe might do were his mother reinstated evenin no more than the earldom of her father is athing that requires the wisdom of all thecouncil to consider for what nf ay be givento her will be given to him and in him theenemy has been but disarmed his animeduties bum as fiercely as ever and it werewell to weigh the consequence of restoring tohim any portion of his arms even though itwere no more than his dirk i have thrust of all that sir william but we shall have done little for the peace ofthe realm if we cannot venture to pity andrelieve the sufferings of a poor widow trulysir wmiam it stands not with my honour ifafter such sacrifices we may not do as we list inlose humanities which all men must approvethe spaewife no the safety of the state shall be maintainedwithout respect to what maybe done to lightenthe condition of the duchess of albanyi do therefore again say that you will do meakind service by undertaking this missionssir william seeing the king so bent andhaving noted withal the greatness of his motivesin whatsoever he was minded to domade no farther controversy but retiredand went forthwith to pantaloon and whenhe was come thither he was conducted tothe chamber of the duchess who was muchmoved when she beheld him but withoutexpressing any sentiment of the surprise wherewithshe was agitated she waved her handand pointing to a chair invited him to beseatedafter the lapse of a short time in whichsir william remained as if he had expectedthat she would inquire the object of his visithe began to speak of the joyfulness with whichhe had received the kings commands to assesthe spaewifesure her grace of the
