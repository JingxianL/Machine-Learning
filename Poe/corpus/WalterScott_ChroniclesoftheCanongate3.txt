pry into the interior of the timepiecewhich for general information is displayedon the townsteepleit would be therefore uncourteous to leavemy readers under any doubt concerning theagency which removed the assassin southronfrom the gallows an event which some of theperth citizens ascribed to the foul fiend himselfwhile others were content to lay it uponthe natural dislike of bonthron's countrymenof fife to see him hanging on the river sideas a spectacle dishonourable to their provinceabout midnight after the day when the executionhad taken place when the inhabitantsof perth were deeply buried in slumber threemen mused in their cloaks and bearing adark lantern descended the alleys of a gardenwtdcb led from the house occupied by sir johnramorny to the banks of the tay where a smallboat lay moored to a landingplace or littleprojecting pier the wind howled in a low andmelancholy manner through the leafless shrubsand bushes and a pale moon leaded as it istermed in scotland amongst drifted cloudswhich seemed to threaten rain the three individualsentered the boat with great precautionto escape observation one of them wasa tall powerful man another short and bentdownwards the third middlesized and apparentlyyounger than his companions and lightand active thus much the imperfect lightcould discover they seated themselves in theboat and unmoored it from the pierwe must let her drift with the current tillwe pass the bridge where the burghers stillkeep guard and you know the proverb aperth arrow hath a perfect flight said themost youthful of the party who assumed theoffice of helmsman and pushed the boat offfrom the pier whilst the others took the oarswhich were muffled and rowed with all precautiontill they attained the middle of theriver they then ceased their efforts lay upontheir oars and trusted to the steersman for keepingher in midchannelin this manner they passed unnoticed or disregardedbeneath the stately gothic arches ofthe old bridge erected by the magnificent patronageof robert bruce in and carriedaway by an inundation in although theyheard the voices of a civic watch which sincethese disturbances commenced had been nightlymaintained in that important pass no challengewas given and when they were so fardown the stream as to be out of hearing ofthose guardians of the night they began torow but still with precaution and to conversethough in a low toneyou have found a new trade comrade sincei left you said one of the rowers to theother i left you engaged in tending a sickknight and i find you employed in purloining adead body from the gallows a living body so please your squirehoodmaster buncle or else my craft hath failed ofits purposeso i am told master pottercarrier butsaving your clerkship unless you tell me yourtrick i will take leave to doubt of its successa simple toy master buncle not likely toplease a genius so acute as that of your variancemarry thus it is this suspension ofthe human body which the vulgar call hangingoperates death by apoplexy that is the bloodbeing unable to return to the heart by the compressionof the veins it rushes to the brainand the man dies also and as an additionalcause of dissolution the lungs no longer receivethe needful supply of the vital air owingto the ligature of the cord around the thorax and hence the patient perishesi understand that well enough but howis it to be prevented sir medicine said thethird person who was no other than ramorny'spage eliot marry then replied dwining hang methe patient up in such fashion thai the carotidarteries shall not be compressed and theblood will not determine to the brain and apoplexywill not take place and again if therebe no ligature around the thorax the lungswill be supplied with air whether the man behanging in the middle heaven or standing onthe firm earth all this i conceive said eviot but howthese precautions can be reconciled with theexecution of the sentence of hanging is whatmy dull brain cannot comprehendah good youth thy variance hath spoileda fair wit hadst thou studied with methou should'st have learned things more difficultthan these but here is my trick i getme certain bandages made of the same substancewith your young variance's horsegirthshaving especial care that they are of a kindwhich will not shrink on being strained sincethat would spoil my experiment one loopof this substance is drawn under each foot andreturns up either side of the leg to a cincturewith vvbich it is united these cincture areconnected by divers straps down the breast andback in order to divide the weight and therearc sundry other conveniences for easing thepatient but the chief is this the straps orligatures are attached to a broad steel collarcurving outwards and having a hook or twofor the better security of the halter which thefriendly executioner passes around that part ofthe machine instead of applying it to the barethroat of the patient thus when thrown offfrom the ladder the sufferer will find himselfsuspended not by his neck if it please you butby a steel circle which supports the loops inwhich his feet are placed and on which hisweight really rests diminished a little by similarsupports under each arm thus neithervein nor windpipe being compressed the manwill breathe as free and his blood saving fromfright and novelty of situation will flow astemperately as your variance's when you standup in your stirrups to view a field of battle by my faith a quaint and rare device quoth bunchis it not pursued the leech and wellworth being known to such mounting spirits asyour vacancies since there is no knowing towhat height sir john ramorny's pupils mayarrive and if these be such that it is necessaryto descend from them by a rope you may findmy mode of management

poisonvender said eviot men ofour calling die on the field of battle i will save the lesson however repliedbuncle in case of some pinching occasionbut what a night the hangdog bloody bonthronemust

gibbetwill but encourage him to new murders heknows but two elements drunkenness andbloodshedperhaps sir john ramorny might havebeen of your opinion said dwining but itwould first have been necessary to cut out therogue's tongue lest he had told strange talesfrom his airy height and there are otherreasons that it concerns not your vacancies toknow in truth i myself have been generousin serving him for the fellow is built as strongas edinburgh castle and his anatomy wouldhave matched any that is in the chirurgical hallof padua but tell me master buncle whatnews bring you from the doughty douglas they may tell that know said bunclei am the dull ass that bears the message andkens nought of its purport the safer for myselfperhaps i carried letters from the dukeof albany and from sir john ramorny

lowtone d wining ventured to give a low coughonce or twice by way of signal but receivingno answer we had best make haste said heto ills companions for our friend must be inextremes as he gives no answer to the signalwhich announces the arrival of help comelet us to the gear i will go up the ladderfirst and cut the rope do you two follow oneafter another and take fast hold of the body sothat he fall not when the halter is unloosedkeep sure gripe for which the bandages will affordyou convenience bethink you that thoughhe plays an owes part tonight he hath no wingsand to fall out of a halter may be as dangerousas to fall into onewhile he spoke thus he ascended the ladderand having ascertained that the menatarmswho followed him had the body in their holdhe cut the rope and then gave his aid to supportthe almost lifeless form of the criminalby a skilful exertion of strength and addressthe body of bonthron was placed safely on theground and the faint yet certain existence oflife having been ascertained it was thence transportedto the river side where shrouded bythe bank the party might be best concealedfrom observation while the leech employed himselfin the necessary means of recalling animationwith which he had taken care to providehimselffor this purpose he first freed the recoveredperson from his shackles which the executionerhad left unlocked on purpose and at thesame time disengaged the complicated envelopesand bandages by which he had been suspendedit was some time ere dwining's efforts succeeded for in despite of the skill with which hismachine had been constructed the straps designedto support the body had stretched soconsiderably as to occasion the sense of suffocationbecoming extremely overpowering butthe address of the surgeon triumphed over allobstacles and after sneezing and stretchinghimself with one or two brief convulsions bonthronegave decided proofs of animation byarresting the hand of the operator as it was inthe act of dropping strong waters on his breastand throat and directing the bottle which containedthem to his lips he took almost perforcea considerable gulp of the contentsit is spiritual essence double distilled saidthe astonished operator and would blisterthe throat and burn the stomach of any otherman but this extraordinary beast is so unlikeall other human creatures that i shouldnot wonder if it brought him to the completepossession of his facultiesbonthron sat up stared around and indicatedsome consciousness of existencewine wine were the first words whichhe articulatedthe leech gave him a draught of medicatedwine mixed with water he rejected it underthe dishonourable epithet of kennelwashingsand again uttered the words wine winenay take it to thee i the devil's namesaid the leech since none

soul in a place where water is tooscarce to duck theei begin to bethink me said the ruffian and raising the flask to his mouth which he salutedwith a long and hearty kiss he set theempty bottle on the earth dropped his head onhis bosom and seemed to muse for the purposeof arranging his confused recollections we can abide the issue of his meditationsno longer said dwining he will be betterafter he

understandingwould never recover the shock whichterror had inflicted upon it and which appearedto him to have disturbed all the faculties ofthis mind and in particular his memoryit is not so an it

timidity upon the scaffold and behavingand expressing himself as men in thesame condition are wont to do accident didfor him what a little ingenious practice hathdone for our amiable friend from whom we butnow parted he was cut down and given to hisfriends before life was extinct and i had thegood fortune to recover him but though herecovered in other particulars he rememberedbut little of his trial and sentence of his confessionon the morning of his execution he he he in his usual chuckling manner heremembered him not a word neither of leavingthe prison nor of his passage to the gravewhere

pathsere it be longwithout inquiring into the meaning of theseevilboding sentences and indeed hardly listeningto them in the pride and recklessness of hisnature the page of ramorny parted from hisingenious and dangerous companion and eachtook his own wayichapter iithe come of true love never did run smooththe ominous anxiety of our armourer hadnot played bim false when the good gloverparted with his intended soninlaw after thejudicial combat had been decided he found whathe indeed had expected that his fair daughterwas in no favourable disposition to her lover butalthough he perceived that catharine was coldrestrained collected had cast away the appearanceof mortal passion and listened with a reserveimplying contempt to the most splendiddescription he could give her of the combat inthe skinners yards he was determined not totake the least notice of her altered manner butto speak of her marriage with his son henry asathing which must of course take place atlength when she began as on a former occasionto intimate that her attachment to the armourerdid not exceed the bounds of friendship thatshe was resolved never to marry that the pretendedjudicial combat was a mockery of thedivine will and of human laws the glover notunnaturally grew angryi cannot read thy thoughts wench norcan i pretend to guess under what wicked delusionit is that you kiss a declared lover sufferhim to kiss you run to his house when a reportis spread of his death and fling yourself intohis arms when you find him alone all thisshows very well in a girl prepared to obey herparents in a match sanctioned by her father but such tokens of intimacy bestowed on onewhom a young woman cannot esteem and isdetermined not to marry are untimely and unmaidenlyyou have already been more bounteousof your favours to henry smith than yourmother whom god assoilzie ever was to mebefore i married her tell thee catharinethis trifling with the love of an honest man iswhat i neither can will nor ought to endure ihave given my consent to the match and i insistit shall take place without delay and thatyou receive henry wynd tomorrow as a manwhose bride you are to be with all dispatcha power more potent than yours fatherwill say no replied catharinei will risk it my power is a lawful onethat of a father over a child and an erringchild answered her father god and manallow of my influencethen may heaven help us said catharine for if you are obstinate in your purposewe are all lost we can expect no help from heaven saidthe glover when we act with indiscretion am clerk enough myself to know that andthat your causeless resistance to my will is sinfulevery priest will inform you ay and morethan that you have spoken degradingly of theblessed appeal to god in the combat of ordealtake heed for the holy church is awakened towatch her sheepfold and to extirpate heresy byfire and steel so much i warn thee ofcatharine uttered a suppressed exclamation and with difficulty compelling herself to assumean appearance of composure promised herfather that if he would spare her any fartherdiscussion of the subject till tomorrow morningshe would then meet him determined tomake a full discovery of heirs sentimentswith this promise simon glover was obligedto remain contented though extremely anxiousfor the postponed explanation it could not belevity or fickleness of character which inducedhis daughter to act with so much apparent inconsistencytowards the man of his choiceand whom she had so lately unequivocally ownedto be also the man of her own what externalforce there could exist of a kind powerfulenough to change the resolutions she had sodecidedly expressed within twentyfour hourswas a matter of complete mysterybut i will be as obstinate as she can bethoughtthe glover and she shall either marryhenry smith without farther delay or oldsimon glover will know an excellent reason tothe contrarythe subject was not renewed during theevening but early on the next morning justat surprising catharine knelt before the bedin which her parent still slumbered her heartsobbed as if it would burst and her tears fellthick upon her father's face the good old manawoke looked up crossed his child's foreheadand kissed her affectionatelyi understand thee kate he said thouart come to confession and i trust art deftserous to escape a heavy penance by being sincerecatharine was silent for an instanti need not ask my father if you rememberthe carthusian monk clement and hispreaching and lessons at which indeed youassisted so often that you cannot be ignorantmen called you one of his converts and withgreater j justice termed me so likewise i am aware of both said the old manraising himself on his elbow but i defy foulfame to show that i ever owned him in anvheretical proposition though i loved to hearhim talk of the corruptions of the church themisgovernment of the nobles and the wild ignoranceof the poor proving as it seemed to methat the sole virtue of our commonweal itsstrength and its estimation lay among theburgher craft of the better class which i receivedas comfortable doctrine and creditableto the town and if he preached other thanright doctrine wherefore did his superiors inthe carthusian convent permit it if the shepherdsturn a wolf in sheep's clothing into theflock they should not blame the sheep for beingworriedthey endured his preaching nay they encouragedit said catharine while the vicesof the laity the contentions of the nobles andthe oppression of the poor were the subject ofhis censure and they rejoiced in the crowdswho attracted to the carthusian church forsookthose of the other convents but the hypocrites for such they are joined with theother fraternities in accusing their preacher clementwhen passing from censuring the crimesof the state he began to display the pride ignoranceand luxury of the churchmen themselves their thirst of power their usurpation overrun'sconsciences and their desire to augment theirworldly wealthfor god's sake catharine said her father speak within doors your voice rises intoneand your speech in bitterness your eyessparkle it is owing to this zeal in what concernsyou no more than others that maliciouspersons fix upon you the odious and dangerousname of a hereticyou know i speak no more than what istruth said catharine and which you yourselfhave avouched oftenby needle and buckskin no answeredthe glover hastily would'st thou have meavouch what might cost me life and limb laudand goods for a full commission hath beengranted for taking and trying heretics uponwhom is laid the cause of all late tumults andmiscarriages wherefore few words are bestwench i am ever of mind with the old makereen perverted and yonare in dittay as a gross railer against church andchurchmen and for holding discourse againstthem with loose and profligate persons such asthe deceased oliver proudfute the smithhenry of the wynd and others set forth ascommending the doctrines of father clementwhom they charge with seven rank heresies andseek for with staff and spear to try him to thedeath but that said catharine kneeling andlooking upwards with the aspect of one of thosebeauteous saints whom the catholics have givento the fine arts that they shall never dohe hath escaped from the net of the fowler and i thank heaven it was by my meansthy means girl art thou mad said theamazed gloveri will not deny what i glory in answeredcatharine it was by my means that conchawas led to come hither with a party of men andcarry off the old man who is now far beyondthe highland lineo my rash my unlucky child said theglover hast thou dared to aid the escape ofone accused of heresy and to invite highlandersin arms to interfere with the administrationof justice within burgh alas thou hast offendedboth against the laws of the church andthose of the realm what what would becomeof us were this known it is known my dear father said the maidenfirmly known even to those who willbe the most willing avengers of the deedthis must be some idle notion catharineor some trick of those cogging priests and nuns it accords not with thy late cheerful willingnessto wed henry smithalas dearest father remember the dismalsurprise occasioned by his reported death andthe joyful amazement at finding him alive anddeem it not wonder if i permitted myself underyour protection to say more than my reflectionjustified but then i knew not the worstand thought the danger exaggerated alas iwas yesterday fearfully undeceived when theabbess herself came hither and with her thedominican they showed me the commissionunder the broad seal of scotland for inquiringinto and punishing heresy they showed meigyour name and my own in a list of suspectedpersons and it was with tears real tears thatthe abbess conjured me to avert a dreadfulfate by a speedy retreat into the cloister andthat the monk pledged his word that you shouldnot be molested if i compliedthe foul fiend take them both for crocodiles said the gloveralas replied catharine complaint orangerwill little help us but you see i have hadreal cause for this present alarmalarm call it utter ruin alas my recklesschild where was your prudence when youran headlong into such a snare hear me father said catharine thereis still one mode of safety held out it is onewhich i have often proposed and for which ihave in vain supplicated your permissioni understand you the convent said herfather but catharine what abbess or prioresswould dare that i will explain to you father and itwill also show the circumstances which havemade me seem unsteady of resolution to a demogree which has brought censure upon me fromyourself and others our confessor old fatherfrancis whom i chose from the dominican conventat your command ay truly interrupted the glover and iso counselled and commanded thee in order totake off the report that thy conscience was altogetherunder the direction of father clementwell this father francis has at differenttimes urged and provoked me to converse onsuch matters as he judged i was likely to learnsomething of from the carthusian preacherheaven forgive me my blindness i fell into thesnare spoke freely and as he argued gently asone who would fain be convinced i even arguedwarmly in defence of what i believed devoutlythe confessor assumed not his real aspect andbetrayed not his secret purpose until he hadlearned all that i had to tell him it was thenthat he threatened me with temporal punishmentand with eternal condemnation had histhreats reached mc alone i could have stoodfirm for their cruelty on earth i could havevol iii csendured and their power beyond this life i haveno belief infor heaven's sake said the glover vrbowas wellnigh beside himself at perceiving atevery new word the increasing extremity of hisdaughter's danger beware of blaspheming theholy church whose arms are as prompt tostrike as her ears are sharp to hearto me said the maid of perth againlooking up the terrors of the threatened denunciationswould have been of little avail but when they spoke of involving thee my fatherin the charge against me i own i trembledand desired to compromise the abbessmartha of elcho nunnery being my mother'skinswoman i told her my distresses andobtained her promise that she would receive meif renouncing worldly love and thoughts of wedlocki would take the veil in her sisterhoodshe had conversation on the topic i doubt notwith the dominican francis and both joinedin singing the same song remain in theworld said they and thy father and thoushall be brought to trial as heretics assume theveil and the errors of both shall be forgiven andcancelled they spoke not even of recantationof errors of doctrine all should be peace if iwould but enter the conventi doubt not i doubt not said simon the old glover is thought rich and his wealthwould follow his daughter to the convent ofelcho unless what the dominicans might claimas their own share so this was thy call to theveil these thy objections to henry wynd indeed father the course was urged onall hands nor did my own mind recoil from itsir john ramorny threatened me with thepowerful vengeance of the young prince if icontinued to repel his wicked suit and as forpoor henry it is but of late that i have discoveredto my own surprise that that i lovehis virtues more than i dislike his faults alas the discovery has only been made to make myquitting the world more difficult than when thought i had thee only to regretshe rested her head on her hand and weptbitterly all this is folly said the glover neverwas there an extremity so pinching butwhat a wise man might find counsel if he wasdaring enough to act upon it this has neverbeen the land or the people over whom priestscould rule in the name of rome without theirusurpation being controlled if they are to punisheach honest burgher who says the monkslove gold and that the lives of some of themcry shame upon the doctrines they teach whytruly stephen smothered will not lack employment and if all foolish maidens are to besecluded from the world because they followthe erring doctrines of a popular preaching friarthey must enlarge

thetemporal government of the kingdom therewanted not a scottish parliament who told himhis duty in a letter that should have been writtenin letters of gold i have seen the epistlemyself and though i

is no timeto tax thee with thy fault go down get mesome food i will mount instantly and go to ourlord provost and have his advice and as itrust his protection and that of other trueheartedscottish nobles who will not see a trueman trodden down for an idle word alas my father said catharine it waseven this impetuosity which i dreaded i knewif i made my plaint to you there would soon befire and feud as if religion though sent to us bythe father of peace were fit only to be the motherof discord and hence i could now evennow give up the world and retire with mysorrow among the sisters of elcho would youbut let me be the sacrifice only father comfortpoor henry when we are parted for ever and do not do not let him think of me tooharshly say catharine will never vex himmore by her

wilfulnessnow the pilot in calm weather will let aseaboy trifle with the rudder but by my soulwhen winds howl and waves arise he standsby the helm himself away no replycatharine left the room to execute as wellas she might the commands of her father whogentle in disposition and devotedly attachedto his child suffered her often as it seemed toguide and rule both herself and him yet whoas she knew was wont to claim filial obedienceand exercise parental authority with sufficientstrictness when the occasion seemed to requirean enforcement of domestic disciplinewhile the fair catharine was engaged inexecuting her father's behests and the goodold glover was hastily attiring himself as onewho was about to take a journey a horse'stramp was heard in the narrow street thehorseman was wrapped in his riding cloak havingthe cape of it drawn up as if to hide theunder part of his face while his bonnet waspulled over his brows and a broad plume ohscaredbis upper features he sprung from thesaddle and dorothy had scarce time to reply tohis inquiries that the glover was in his bedroomere the stranger had ascended the stair and enteredthe sleeping apartment simon astonishedand alarmed and disposed to see in thisearly visitant an apparitor or sumner come toattach him and his daughter was much relievedwhen as the stranger doffed the bonnetand threw the skirt of the mantle from his facehe recognised the knightly provost of the faircity a visit from whom at any time was a favourof no ordinary degree but being made atsuch an hour had something marvellous andconnected with the circumstances of the timeseven alarmingsir patrick charteris said the glover this high honour done to your poor beadsman hush said the knight there is no timefor idle civilities i came hither because

under charge of heresyand delay will cost you both your liberty forcertain and perhaps your livesi have heard something of such a mattersaid the glover and was this instant settingforth to kinfauns to plead my innocence ofthis scandalous charge to ask your lordship'scounsel and to implore your protectionthy innocence friend simon will availthee but little before prejudiced judges myadvice is in one word to fly and wait for happiertimes as for my protection we must tarry tillthe tide turns ere it will in any sort avail theebut if thou canst lie concealed for a few daysor weeks i have little doubt that the churchmenwho by siding with the duke of albanyin court intrigue and by alleging the decay ofthe purity of catholic doctrine as the sole causeof the present national misfortunes have at leastfor the present hour an irresistible authorityover the king wil receive a check in the meanwhilehowever know that king robert hathnot only given way to this general warrant forinquisition after heresy but hath confirmedthe pope's nomination of robert wardle tobe archbishop of st andrews and primate ofscotland thus yielding to rome those freedomsand immunities of the scottish church whichhis ancestors from the time of malcolm canmorehave so boldly defended his brave fatherswould have rather subscribed a covenantwith the devil than yielded in such a matter tothe pretensions of romealas and what remedy none old man save in some sudden courtchange said sir patrick the king is but likea mirror which having no light itself reflectsback with equal readiness any which is placednear to it for the time now although the douglasis banded with albany yet the earl is unfavourableto the high claims of those domineeringpriests having quarrelled with them about theexactions which his retinue hath

sight sir patrick followed leisurely butwhen he was lost to the view of the wardershe sparred his mettled horse and soon cameup with the glover and catharine when a conversationensued which throws light upon someprevious passages of this historychapter iiii have been devising a mode said thewellmeaning provost by which i may makeyou both secure for a week or two from themalice of your enemies when i have little doubti may see a changed world at court but thati may the better judge what is to be done tellme frankly simon the nature of your connexionwith gilchrist maclan which leads you torepose such implicit confidence in him youare a close observer of the rules of the city andare aware of the severe penalties which they denounceagainst such burghers as have covenantalliance with the highland clanstrue my lord but it is also known toyou that our craft working in skins of cattlestags and every other description of hides havea privilege and are allowed to transact with thosehighlanders as with the men who can mostreadily supply us with the means of conductingour trade to the great profit of the burghthus it hath chanced me to have great dealingswith these men and i can take it on mysalvation that you nowhere find more just andhonourable trafficked or by whom a man maymore easily make an honest penny i have madein my day several distant journeys into the farhighlands upon the faith of their chiefs nordid i ever meet with a people more true to theirword when you can once prevail upon them toplight it in your behalf and as for the highlandchief gilchrist maclan saving that he is hastyin homicide and fireraising towards those withwhom he hath deadly feud i have nowhere seena man who walketh a more just and uprightpathit is more than ever i heard before saidsir patrick charteris yet i have knownsomething of the highland run agates toothey sliovv another favour and a very differentone to their friends than to their enemiesas your lordship shall understand said theglover however be that as it may it chancedme to serve gilchrist maclan in a highmatter it is now about eighteen years sincethat it chanced the clan quhele and clanchattan being at feud as indeed they are seldomat peace the former sustained such a defeatas wellnigh extirpated the family of theirchief maclan seven of his sons were slain inbattle and after it himself put to flight and hiscastle taken and given to the flames his wifethen near the time of giving birth to an infantfled into the forest attended by one faithful servantand his daughter here in sorrow and careenough she gave birth to a boy and as the miseryof the mother's condition rendered her littleable to suckle the infant he was nursed with themilk of a doe which the forester who attendedher contrived to take alive in a snare itwas not many months afterwards that in a secondencounter of these fierce clans maclandefeated his enemies in his turn and regainedvol iii dpossession of the district which he had lost itwas with unexpected rapture that he found hiswife and child were in existence having neverexpected to see more of them than the bleachedbones from which the wolves and wildcats hadeaten the fleshbut a strong and prevailing prejudice suchas is often entertained by these wild peopleprevented their chief from enjoying the fullhappiness arising from having thus regainedhis only son in safety an ancient prophecywas current among them that the power ofthe tribe should fall by means of a boy born undera bush of holly and suckled by a white doethe circumstance unfortunately for the chieftallied exactly with the birth of the only childwhich remained to him and it was demandedof him by the elders of the clan that the boyshould be either put to death or at least removedfrom the dominions of the tribe and broughtup in obscurity gilchrist mac ian was obliged toconsent and having made choice of the latterproposal the child under the name of conacharwas brought up in my family with the purposeas was at first intended of concealing from himall knowledge who or what he was or of hispretensions to authority over a numerous andwarlike people but as years rolled on the eldersof the tribe who had exerted so much authoritywere removed by death ter rendered incapableof interfering in the public affairs by age while on the other hand the influence of gilchristmaclan was increased by his successfulstruggles against the clan chattan in which herestored the equality betwixt the two contendingconfederacies which had existed before thecalamitous defeat of which i told your honourfeeling himself thus firmly seated he naturallybecame desirous to bring home his only sonto his bosom and family and for that purposecaused me to send the young conacharas he was called more than once to the highlandshe was a youth expressly made by hisform and gallantry of bearing to gain a father'sheart at length i suppose the lad eitherguessed the secret of his birth or somethingof it was communicated to him and the disgustwhich the haughty hieland varlet had alwaysshown for my honest trade became more offest so that i dared not so much as lay mystaff over bis costard for fear of receiving astab with a dirk as an answer in gaelic to asaxon remark it was then i wished to be wellrid of him the rather that he showed so muchdevotion to catharine who forsooth set herselfup to wash the ethiopian and teach awild husbandman mercy and morals she knowsherself how it endednay my father said catharine it wassurely but a point of charity to snatch the brandfrom the burningbut a small point of wisdom said her father to risk the burning of your own fingersfor such an end what says my lord to thematter my lord would not offend the fair maid ofperth said sir patrick and he knows wellthe purity and truth of her mind and yet i mustneeds say that had this nursling of the doebeen shrivelled haggard crossmade and repairedlike some highlanders i have known iquestion if the fair maiden of perth wouldhave bestowed so much zeal upon his convertssioii and if catharine had been as aged wrinkledand bent by years as the old woman thatopened the door to me this morning i wouldwager my gold spurs against a pair of highlandbrogues that this wild roebuck wouldnever have listened to a second lecture youlaugh glover and catharine blushes a blushof anger let it pass it is the way of theworldthe way in which the men of the worldesteem their neighbours my lord answeredcatharine with some spiritnay fair saint forgive a jest said theknight and thou simon tell us how thistale ended with conachar's escape to thehighlands i suppose with his return thither said the gloverthere was for some two or three years a fellowabout perth a sort of messenger who cameand went under divers pretences but was infact the means of communication between gilchristmaclan and his son young conacharor as he is now called hector from this gilliei learned in general that the banishmentof the dault an neigh deil or foster child ofthe white doe was again brought under considerationof the tribe his foster father torquitof the oak the old forester appeared witheight sons the finest men of the clan and demandedthat the doom of banishment should berevoked he spoke with the greater authorityas he was himself taishatar or a seer andsupposed to have communication with the invisibleworld he affirmed that he had performeda magical ceremony termed tineganby which he evoked a fiend from whom he extorteda confession that conachar now calledeachin or hector maclan was the only manin the approaching combat between the twohostile clans who should come off withoutblood or blemish hence torquil of the oakargued that the presence of the fated personwas necessary to insure the victory so muchi am possessed of this said the forester thatunless eachin fight in his place in the ranks ofthe clan quhele neither i his fosterfathernor any of my eight sons will lift a weapon inthe quarrelthis speech was received with much alarmfor the defection of nine men the stoutest of theirtribe would be a serious blow more especiallyif the combat as begins to be rumoured should bedecided by a small number from each side theancient superstition concerning the foster son ofthe white doe was counterbalanced by a newand later prejudice and the father took the opportunityof presenting to the clan his longhiddenson whose youthful but handsome andanimated countenance haughty carriage andactive limbs excited the admiration of the clansmenwho joyfully received him as the heir anddescendant of their chief notwithstanding theominous presage attending his birth and nurturefrom this tale my lord continued simonglover your lordship may easily conceivewhy i myself should be secure of a good receptionamong the clan quhele i and you may alsohave reason to judge that it would be very rashin me to carry catharine thither and thisnoble lord is the heaviest of my troubleswe shall lighten the load then said sirpatrick aod good glover i will take riskfor thee and this damsel my alliance with thedouglas gives me some interest with marjoryduchess of rothsay his daughter the

willing tosecure me such honourable protection if shebe haughty i will remember she is a douglasand hath right to entertain as much pride as maybecome a mortal if she be fretful i will recollectthat she is unfortunate and if she be unreasonablycaptious i will not forget that she ismy protectress heed no longer for me my lordwhen you have placed me under the noble lady'scharge but my poor father

somewhat discontentedmuttered to simon as he took his place theseare changed days friend his father rest hissoul would have spoken to us both but theseare bad manners which he has learned amongyou sassenachs in the low countryto this remark the glover did not think itnecessary to reply instead of which he advertedto the evergreens and particularly to the skinsand other ornaments with which the interior ofthe bower was decorated the most remarkablepart of these ornaments was a number of highlandshirts of mail with steel bonnets battleaxesand twohanded swords to match whichhung around the upper part of the room togetherwith targets highly and richly embossedeach mail shirt was hung over a welldressedstag's hide which at once displayed the armourto advantage and saved it from suffering

our celebrated perth armourer called henryof the wynd thou art more unlucky than before saidniel that man's name is to eachin's temperlike a whirlwind upon the lake yet no manknows for what causei can guess thought our glover but gaveno utterance to the thought and having twicelighted on unpleasant subjects of conversationhe prepared to apply himself like those aroundhim to his food without starling another topicwe have said as much of the preparations asmay lead the reader to conclude that the festivalin respect of the quality of the food was ofthe most rude description consisting chiefly ofhuge joints of meat which were consumed withlittle respect to the fasting season althoughseveral of the friars of the island convent gracedand hallowed the board by their presence theplatters were of wood and so were the hoopedrogues or cups out of which the guestsquaffed their liquor as also the broth or juiceof the meat which was held a delicacy therewere also various preparations of milk whichwere highly esteemed and were eaten out ofsimilar vessels bread was the scarcest articleat the banquet but the glover and his patronniel were served with two small loaves expresslyfor their own use in eating as indeed wasthen the case all over britain the guests usedtheir knives called scenes or the large poniardsnamed dirks without troubling themselves bythe reflection that they might occasionally haveserved different or more fatal purposesat the upper end of the table stood a vacantseat elevated a step or two above the floor itwas covered with a canopy of holly boughs andivy and there rested against it a sheathed swordand a folded banner this had been the seat ofthe deceased chieftain and was left vacant inhonour of him eachin occupied a lower chairon the right hand of the place of honourthe reader would be greatly mistaken whoshould follow out this description by supposingthat the guests behaved like a herd of hungrywolves rushing upon a feast rarely offered tothem on the contrary the clan quhele conductedthemselves with that species of courteousreserve and attention to the wants of otherswhich is often found in primitive nations especiallysuch as are always in arms because ageneral observance of the rules of courtesy isnecessary to prevent quarrels bloodshed anddeath the guests took the places assignedthem by torquil of the oak who acting asmarischal taeh i e sewer of the mess touchedwith a white wand without speaking aword the place where each was to sit thusplaced in order the company patiently waitedfor the portion

and a handfulof soft moss served the purposes of a tablenapkinso that as at an eastern banquet the handswere washed as often as the mess was changedfor amusement the bard recited the praisesof the

wrangling preacher who wouldbe right heartily welcome to share our protection thou art dull man and wilt not guessmy meaning thy daughter catharine these last words the young chief spoke inenglish and he continued the conversation inthat language as if apprehensive of being overheard and indeed as if under the sense of someinvoluntary hesitationmy daughter catharine said the gloverremembering what

charteris said eachinin a more reserved and distant tone hemust be preferred to all men without doubt heis your friend i think simon glover longed to punish this affectationof a boy who had been scolded four timesaday for running into the street to see sir patrickcharteris ride past but he checked hisspirit of repartee and simply said sir patrick charteris has been provost ofperth for seven years and it is likely is sostill since the magistrates are elected not inlent but at st martinmasah father glover said the youth in hiskinder and more familiar mode of address you are so used to see the sumptuous showsand pageants of perth that you would but littlerelish our barbarous festival in comparisonwhat didst thou think of our ceremonial of yesterdayit was noble and touching said the glover and to me who knew your father mostespecially so when you rested on the swordand looked around you methought i saw mineold friend gilchrist mac ian arisen from thedead and renewed in years and in strengthi played my part there boldly i trust andshowed little of that paltry apprentice boywhom you used to use just as he deservedeachin resembles conachar said the glover no more than a salmon

myself an object for a maiden's eyeto rest upon to speak plain what would catharinehave thought of me in the ceremonial we approach the shallows now thought simonglover and without nice pilotage

seemedvery attentiveto my resolution answered simon fori think nothing can make a man so bold to faceone danger at some distance in his front asthe knowledge of another close behind himto push him forward well i mounted thewalls in tolerable heart and was placed withothers on the spey tower being accounted agood bowman but a very cold fit seized me asi saw the english in great order with theirarchers in front and their menatarms behindmarching forward to the attack in strong columnsthree in number they came on steadilyand some of us would fain have shot atthem but it was strictly forbidden and we wereobliged to remain motionless sheltering ourselvesbehind the battlement as we best mightas the southron formed their long ranks intolines each man occupying his place as by magicand preparing to cover themselves by largeshields called passes which they planted beforethem i again felt a strange breathlessnessand some desire to go home for a glass of distilledwaters but as i looked aside i saw theworthy kempe of kinfauns bending a large crossbowand i thought it pity he should waste thebolt on a truehearted scotsman when so manyenglish were in presence so i e'en staid wherei was being in a comfortable angle formed bytwo battlements the english then strode forwardand drew their bowstrings not to thebreast as your highland kerne do but to theear and sent off their volleys of swallowtailsbefore we could call on st andrew i winkedwhen i saw them haul up their tackle and ibelieve i started as the shafts began to rattleagainst the parapet but looking round me andseeing none hurt but john squalls the towncrierwhose jaws were pierced through witha clothyard shaft i took heart of grace andshot in my turn with good will and good aima little man i shot at who had just popped outfrom behind his target dropt with a shaftthrough his shoulder the provost cried well stitched simon glover saint johnfor his own town my fellow craftsmen shouted i though i was then but an apparentthe honour of our guild and if youwill believe me in the rest of the skirmish whichwas ended by the foes drawing off i drew bowstringand loosed shaft as calmly as if i hadbeen shooting at butts instead of men's breastsi gained some credit and i have ever afterwardsthought that in case of necessity for with meit had never been matter of choice i should nothave lost it again and this is all i can tell ofwarlike experience in battle other dangers ihave had which i have endeavoured to avoidlike a wise man or when they were inevitablei have faced them like a true one upon otherterms a man cannot live or hold up his head inscotlandi understand your tale said eachin buti shall find it difficult to make you credit mineknowing the race of which i am descended andespecially him whom we have this day laid inthe tomb well that he lies where he will neverlearn what you are now to hear look my father the light which i bear grows short andpale a few minutes will extinguish it but beforeit expires the hideous tale will be told father i am a coward it h said at lastand the secret of my disgrace is in keeping ofanother the young man sunk back in a species of syncopeproduced by the agony of his mind as hemade the fatal communication the glovermoved as well by fear as by compassion appliedhimself to recall him to life and succeeded indoing so but not in restoring him to composurehe hid his face with his hands and his tearsflowed plentifully and bitterlyfor our lady's sake be composed saidthe old man and recall the vile word i knowyou better than yourself you are no cowardbut only too young and inexperienced ay andsomewhat too quick of fancy to have the steadyvalour of a bearded man i would hear noother man say that of you conachar withoutgidng him the lie you are no coward i haveseen high sparks of spirit fly from you even onslight enough provocationhigh sparks of pride and passion said theunfortunate youth but when saw you themsupported by the resolution that should havebacked them the sparks you speak of fell onmy dastardly heart as on a piece of ice whichcould catch fire from nothing if ray offendedpride urged me to strike my weakness of mindprompted me the next moment to flywant of habit said simon it is byclambering over walls that youths learn to scaleprecipices begin with slight feuds exercisedaily the arms of your country in tourney withyour followersand what leisure is there for this exclaimedthe young chief starting as if somethinghorrid had occurred to his imaginationhow many days are there betwixt this hourand palm

butthere must be no parley no truce no interruptionwhile any of the maimed wretches remainalive here is no crouching behind battlementsno fighting with missile weapons all is handto hand till hands can no longer be raised tomaintain the ghastly conflict if such a fieldis so horrible in idea what think you it will bein reality the glover remained silenti say again what think you i can only pity you conachar said simon it is hard to be the descendant of a loftyline the son of a noble father the leader bybirth of a gallant array and yet to want orthink you want for still i trust the fault liesmuch in a quick fancy that overestimates dangerto want that dogged quality which is possessedby every gamecock that is worth a handfulof corn every hound that is worth a messof offal but how chanced it that with such aconsciousness of inability to fight in this battleyou proffered even now to share your chief domwith my daughter your power must depend onyour fighting this combat and in that catharinecannot help youyou mistake old man replied eachin were catharine to look kindly on the earnestlove i bear her it would carry me against thefront of the enemies with the mettle of a

educationand the experience of your strict restraint beit as you think from an overheated fancywhich paints danger yet more dangerous andghastly than it is in reality i cannot tell buti know my failing and yes it must be said so sorely dread that i cannot conquer it thatcould i have your consent to my wishes on suchterms i would caen here make a pause renouncethe rank i have assumed and

shall occupy yourchimneycorner the happiest and most honouredman that ever hold eachin i pr'ythee hold said theglover the fir light with which this discoursemust terminate burns very low and iwould speak a word in my turn and plain dealingis best though it may vex or perhaps enrageyou let me end these visions by saying atonce catharine can never be yours a gloveis the emblem of faith and a man of my craftshould therefore less than any other break hisown catharine's hand is promised promisedto a man whom you may hate but whom youmust honour to henry the armourer thematch is fitting by degree agreeable to theirmutual wishes and i have given my promiseit is best to be plain at once resent my refusalas you will i am wholly in your power butnothing shall make me break my wordthe glover spoke thus decidedly because hewas aware from experience that the very irritabledisposition of his former apprentice yieldedin most cases to stern and decided resolutionyet recollecting where he was it waswith some feelings of fear that he saw the dyingflame leap up and spread a flash of lighton the visage of eachin which seemed paleas the grave while his eye rolled like that ofa maniac in his fever fit the light instantlysunk down and died and simon felt a momentaryterror lest he should have to disputefor his life with the youth whom he knew tobe capable of violent actions when highly excitedhowever short a period his nature couldsupport the measures which his passion commencedhe was relieved by the voice of eachinwho muttered in a hoarse and alteredtone let what we have spoken this night restin silence for ever if thou hring'st it to lightthou wert better dig thine own gravethus speaking the door of the hut openedadmitting a gleam of moonshine the form ofthe retiring chief crossed it for an instant thehurdle door was then closed and the hut leftin darknesssimon glover felt relieved when a conversationfraught with offence and danger wasthus peaceably terminated but he remaineddeeply affected by the condition of hector marianwhom he had himself bred upthe poor child said he to be called uptoa place of eminence only to be hurled fromit with contempt what he told me i partlyknew having often remarked that conacharwas more prone to quarrel than to fight butthis overpowering faintheartiness which neithershame nor necessity can overcome ithough no sir william wallace cannot conceiveand to propose himself for a husband tomy daughter as if a bride were to find couragefor herself and the bridegroom no no catharinemust wed a man to whom she may say husband spare your enejny not one inwhose behalf she must cry generous enemyspare my husband tired out with these reflections the old manat length fell asleep in the morning he wasawakened by his friend the booshalloch whowith something of a blank visage proposed tohim to return to his abode on the meadow atthe ballough that is the discharge of the lakeinto the river he apologized that the chiefcould not see simon glover that morning beingbusied with things about the expected combat and that eachin maclan thought the residenceat the ballough would be safest for simonglover's health and had given charge thatevery care should be taken for his protectionand accommodationniel booshalloch dilated on these circumstancesto gloss over the neglect implied in thechief's dismissing bis visitor without a particularaudiencehis father knew better said the herdsman but where should he have learnedmanners poor thing and bred up among yourperth burghers who excepting yourself neighbourglover who speak gaelic as well as i doare a race incapable of civility simon glover it may be well believed feltnone of the want of respect which his friendresented on his account on the contrary hegreatly preferred the quiet residence of thegood herdsman to the tumultuous hospitalityof the daily festival of the chief even if therehad not just passed an interview with eachinupon a subject which it would be most painfulto reviveto the ballough therefore he quietly retreatedwhere could he have been secure of catharine'ssafety his leisure was spent pleasantlyenough his amusement was sailing on thelake in a little skiff which a highland boy managedwhile the old man angled he frequentlyly landed on the little island where be musedover the tomb of his old friend gilchrist marianand made friends with the monks presentingthe prior with gloves of martin's fur andthe superior officers with each of them a pairmade from the skin of the wildcat the cuttingand stitching of these little presents servedto beguile the time after sunset while thefamily of the herdsman crowded around admiringhis address and listening to the talesand songs vith which the old man had skill topass away a heavy eveningit must be confessed that the cautious gloveravoided the conversation of father clementwhom he erroneously considered as rather theauthor of his misfortunes than the guiltless sharerof them i will not he thought to please hisfancies lose the good will of these kind monkswhich may be one day useful to me i havesuffered enough by his preachments already itrow little the wiser and much the poorerhave they made me no no catharine andclement may think as they will but i will takethe first opportunity to sneak back like a ratedvol iii khound at the call of his master submit to aplentiful course of haircloth and whipcorddisburse a lusty mulct and become whole withthe church againmore than a fortnight had passed since theglover had arrived at ballough and he beganto wonder that he had not heard news of catharineor of henry wynd to whom he concludedthe provost had communicated the planand place of his retreat he knew the stoutsmith dared not come up into the clan quhelecountry on account of various feuds with theinhabitants and with each in himself whilebearing the name of conachar but yet theglover thought henry might have found meansto send him a message or a token by some oneof the various couriers who passed and repassedbetween the court and the headquarters of theclan quhele in order to concert the terms ofthe impending combat the march of the partiesto perth and other particulars requiring previousadjustment it was now the middle ofmarch and the fatal palm sunday was fast approachingwhilst time was thus creeping on the exiledglover had not even once set eyes upon hisformer apprentice the care that was takento attend to his wants and convenience in everyrespect showed that he was not forgotten butyet when he heard the chieftain's horn ringingthrough the woods he usually made it a pointto choose his walk in a different direction onemorning however he found himself unexpectedlyin eachin's close neighbourhood withscarce leisure to avoid him and thus it happenedas simon strolled pensively through a littlesylvan glade surrounded on either side withtall forest trees mixed with underwood a whitedoe broke from the thicket closely pursued bytwo deer greyhounds one of which griped herhaunch the other her throat and pulled herdown within half a furlong of the glover whowas something startled at the suddenness of theincident the near and piercing blast of ahorn and the baying of a slowhound madesimon aware that the hunters were close behindand on the trace of the deer hallooingand the sound of men running through the copsewere heard close at hand a moment's recollectionwould have satisfied simon that his bestway was to stand fast or retire slowly andleave it to eachin to acknowledge his presenceor not as he should see cause but his desireof shunning the young man had grown into akind of instinct and in the alarm of findinghim so near simon hid himself in a bush ofhazels mixed with holly which altogether concealedhim he had hardly done so ere eachinrosy with exercise dashed from the thicket intothe open glade accompanied by his fosterfathertorquil of the oak the latter with equalstrength and address turned the strugglinghind on her back and holding her fore feet inhis right hand while he knelt on her body offeredhis skene with the left to the youngchief that he might cut the animal's throatit may not be torquil do thine office andtake the assay thyself i must not kill thelikeness of my fostermotherthis was spoken with a melancholy smilewhile a tear at the same time stood in thespeaker's eye torquil stared at his youngchief for an instant then drew his sharp woodknifeacross the creature's throat with a cutso swift and steady that the weapon reachedthe back bone then rising on his feet andagain fixing a long piercing look on his chiefhe said as much as i have done to thathind would i do to any living man whose earscould have heard my fault fosterson so muchas name a white doe and couple the word withhector's name if simon had no reason before to keep himselfconcealed this speech of torquil furnishedhim with a pressing oneit cannot be concealed father torquilsaid eachin it will all out to the broad daywhat will out what will to broad day asked torquil in surpriseit is the fatal secret thought simon andnow if this huge privy councillor cannot keepsilence i shall be made answerable i supposefor eachin's disgrace having been blownabroadthinking thus anxiously he availed himselfat the same time of his position to see as muchas he could of what passed between the afflictedchieftain and his confident impelled by thatspirit of curiosity which prompts us in the mostmomentous as well as the most trivial occasionsof life and which is sometimes found tosubsist in company with great personal fearas torquil listened to what eachin communicatedthe young man sank into his arms andsupporting himself on his shoulder concludedhis confession by a whisper into his ear torquitseemed to listen with such amazement asto make him incapable of crediting his earsas if to be certain that it was eachin whospoke he gradually roused the youth from hisreclining posture and holding him up in somemeasure by a grasp on bis shoulder fixed onhim an eye that seemed enlarged and at thesame time turned to stone by the marvels helistened to and so wild waxed the old man'svisage after he had heard the murmured communicationthat simon glover apprehended hewould cast the youth from him as a dishonouredthug ill which case he might have lightedon the very copse in which he lay concealedand occasioned his discovery in a manner equallypainful and dangerous but the passions oftorquil who entertained for his fosterchildeven a double portion of that passionate fondnesswhich always attends that connexion inthe highlands took a different turni believe it not he exclaimed it isfalse of thy father's child false of thy mother'sson falsest of my fault i offer my gage toheaven and hell and

and began to move off in the oppositedirection as fast as his age permitted hisfirst reflection was on the fidelity of the fosterfatherthe wild mountain heart is faithful andtrue yonder man is more like the giants inromaunt than a man of mould like ourselvesand yet christians might take an example fromhim for his lealt a simple contrivance thisthough to finger a man off their enemies chequeras if there would not be twenty of thewildcats ready to supply his placethus thought the glover not aware that thestrictest proclamations were issued prohibitingany of the two contending clans their friendsallies and dependents from coming within fiftymiles of perth during a week before and aweek after the combat which regulation was tobe enforced by armed menso soon as our friend simon arrived at thehabitation of the herdsman he found other newsawaiting him they were brought by fatherclement who came in a pilgrim's cloak ordalmatic ready to commence his return to thesouthwards and desirous to take leave of hiscompanion in exue or to accept him as a travellingcompanionbut what said the citizen has so suddenlyinduced you to return within the reachof danger have you not heard said father clementthat march and his english allies having retiredinto england before the earl of douglasthe good earl has applied himself to redress theevils of the commonwealth and hath written tothe court

troubleof replyhe bad the cheers authority he saidfor saying that simon glover should abideuntil the champions went down to the battlein this answer the citizen saw something notquite consistent with his own perfect freedom ofvolition but he cared little for it at the timeas it furnished a good apology for not travellingalong with the clergymanan exemplary man he said to his friendniel booshalloch

companions interrupthis reflections he raised his head atlength and said my father loves a jest andwhen all is over he will take this frolic at nomore serious rate than it deserves a fit ofyouth with which he will deal as he has withothers yonder my masters shows the oldhold of kinfauns frowning above the taynow tell me john ramorny how thou hastdealt to get the fair maid of perth out of thehands of yonder bullheaded provost for erroltold me it was rumoured that she was under hisprotectiontruly she was my lord with the purposeof being transferred to the patronage of theduchess i mean of the lady marjory ofdouglas now this beetleheaded provost whois after all but a piece of blundering valiancyhas like most such a retainer of some slynessand cunning whom he uses in all his dealingsand whose suggestions he generally considers ashis own ideas whenever i would possess myselfof a landward baron i address myself tosuch a confident who in the present case iscalled kitt henshaw an old skipper upon thetay and who having in his time sailed as faras ampere holds with sir patrick charteristhe respect due to one who has seen foreigncountries this his agent i have made my ownand by his means have insinuated various apologiesin order to postpone the departure ofcatharine for falklandbut to what good purpose i know not if it is wise to tell your highnesslest you should disapprove of my views i meant the officers of the commission for inquiryinto heretical opinions should have foundthe fair maid at kinfauns for our beauty is apeevish selfwilled swerve from the church and certes i designed that the knight shouldhave come in for his share of the fines and confiscationsthat were about to he inflicted themonks were eager enough to be at him seeinghe hath had frequent disputes with them aboutthe salmon ty thebut wherefore wouldst thou have ruinedthe knight's fortunes and brought the beautifulyoung woman to the stake perchance pshaw my lord duke monks neverburn pretty maidens an

lady marjory's societyas sir patrick charteris and she herself dothopine but to keep your highness from tiringwhen we return from hunting in the parkthere was again a long pause in which theprince seemed to muse deeply at length hespoke ramorny i have a scruple in thismatter but if i name it to thee the devil of sophistrywith which thou art possessed will argueit out of me as it has done many others thisgirl is the most beautiful one excepted whomi ever saw or knew and i like her the morethat she bears some features of elizabeth ofdunbar but she i mean catharine glover iscontracted and

frequentlythan i answered the knight in derisionit is true while i but i can be silenton the subject if i cannot forget itwell then i tell thee that i have scrupleabout this intrigue dost thou remember whenwe went in a frolic to hear father clementpreach or rather to see this fair heretic that hespoke as touchingly as a minstrel about the richman taking away thepoor man's onlyewe lamba great matter indeed answered sirjohn that this churl's wife's eldest sonshould be fathered by the prince of scotland how many earls would covet the like fate fortheir fair countesses and how many that havehad such good luck sleep not a grain the worsefor it and if i might presume to speak said themedicine the ancient laws of scotland assignedsuch a privilege to every feudal lord overhis female vassals though lack of spirit and loveof money hath made many exchange it for goldi require no argument to urge me to bekind to a pretty woman but this catharine hasbeen ever cold to me said the princenay my lord said ramorny if younghandsome and a prince you know not how tomake yourself acceptable to a fine woman it isnot for me to say moreand if it were not far too great audacityin me to speak again i would say quoth theleech that all perth knows that the gotochrom never was the maiden's choice but fairlyforced upon her by her father i know forcertain that she refused him

pestilenceor the pothecary must thou too needsthwart my humour while the prince thus silenced the remonstrancesof dwining sir john ramorny hadsnatched a moment to learn from henshaw thatithe removal of the duchess of rothsay fromfalkland was still kept profoundly secret andthat catharine glover would arrive there thatevening or the next morning in expectation ofbeing taken under the noble lady's protectionthe duke of rothsay deeply plunged inthought received this intimation so coldly thatramorny took the liberty of remonstratingthis my lord he said is playing the spoiledchild of fortune you

and then an end of human illfor thou art deadthe prince made no observation on the music and the maiden at ramorny's beck wenton from time to time with her minstrel craftuntil the evening sunk down into rain firstsoft and gentle at length in great quantitiesand accompanied by a cold wind there wasneither cloak nor covering for the prince andhe sullenly rejected that which ramorny offeredit is not for rothsay to wear your castgarments sir john this melted snow which ifeel pierce me to the very marrow i am nowencountering by your fault why did you presumeto put off the boat without my

forward to see what might be the causeand oh i heard a groaning as of one in extremepain but so faint that it seemed to arisetout of the very depth of the earth at lengthi found it proceeded from a small rent in thewall covered with ivy and when i laid my earclose to the opening i could hear the prince'svoice distinctly say it cannot now last longand then it sunk away in something like aprayergracious heaven did you speak to himi said is it you my lord and the answerwas who mocks me with that name i asked him if i could help him and he answeredwith a voice i shall never forget food

fatherthis ring and a lock of my hair and say catharinedied in endeavouring to save the bloodof bruce and give this other lock to henry say catharine thought of him to the last andthat if he has judged her too scrupulous touchingthe blood of others he will then know itwas not because she valued her ownthey sobbed in each other's arms and theintervening hours till evening were spent in endeavouringto devise some better mode of supplyingthe captive with nourishment and in theconstruction of a tube composed of hollow reedsslipping into each other by which liquids mightbe conveyed to

enteredthe kitchen when the female minstrel againthrowing herself in catharine's arms and assuringher of her unalterable fidelity crept insilence down stairs the little dog under herarm a moment after she was seen by thebreathless catharine wrapt in the dey woman'scloak and walking composedly across the drawbridgeso said the warder you return earlytonight may bridget small mirth towardsin the hall ha wench sick times are sadtimes hence perhaps dairywoman and dairyi have forgotten my tallies said the readmittedfrenchwoman and will return inthe skimming of a bowieshe went onward avoiding the village offalkland and took a footpath which led throughthe park catharine breathed freely and blessedgod when she saw her lost in the distance itwas another anxious hour for catharine whichoccurred before the escape of the fugitive wasdiscovered this happened so soon as the deygirlhaving taken an hour to perform a taskwhich ten minutes might have accomplishedwas about to return and discovered that someonehad taken away her grey frieze cloak astrict search was set on foot at length the womenof the house remembered the gleemaidenand ventured to suggest her as one not unlikelyto exchange an old cloak for a new onethe warder strictly questioned averred he sawthe deywoman depart immediately after vespers and on this being contradicted by the partyherself he could suggest as the only alternativethat it must needs have been the devilas however the gleewoman could not bevol iii pfound the real circumstances of the case wereeasily guessed at and the steward went to informsir john ramorny and dwining whowere now scarcely ever separate of the escape ofone of their female captives everything awakensthe suspicions of the guilty they lookedon each other with faces of dismay and thenwent together to the humble apartment of catharinethat they might take her as much aspossible by surprise while they inquired intothe facts attending louise's disappearance where is your companion young woman said ramorny in a tone of austere grarcity mi have no companion here answered catharine trifle not replied the knight i meanthe gleemaiden who lately dwelt in this chamberwith you she is gone they tell me said catharinegone about an hour sinceand whither said dwining show answered catharine should iknow which way a professed wanderer maychoose to travel she was tired no doubt of asolitary life so different from the scenes offeasting and dancing which her trade leads herto frequent she is gone and the only wonderis that she should have stayed so longthis then is all you have to tell usall that i have to tell you sir john answeredcatharine firmly and if the princehimself inquire i can tell him no more there is little danger of his again doingyou the honour to speak to you in person saidramorny even if scotland should escapebeing rendered miserable by the sad event ofhis decease is the duke of rothsay so very ill askedcatharine no help save in heaven answered ramornlooking upwardthen may there yet be help there saidcatharine if human aid prove unavailing amen said ramorny with the most determinedgravity while dwining adopted a facefit to echo the feeling though it seemed to costhim a painful struggle to suppress his sneeringyet soft laugh of triumph which was peculiarlyexcitedby anything having a religious tendencyand it bis men earthly men and not incarnatedevils who thus appeal to heaven whilethey are devouring by inches the lifeblood oftheir hapless master muttered catharine ashertwo baffled inquisitors left the apartment why sleeps the thunder but it wih roll erelongand oh may it be to preserve as well asto punish the hour of dinner alone afforded a spacewhen all in the castle being occupied with thatmeal catharine thought she had the best opportunityof venturing to the breach in the wallwith the least chance of being observed inwaiting for the hour she observed some stir inthe castle which had been silent as the graveever since the seclusion of the duke of rothsaythe portcullis was lowered and raised and thecreaking of the machinery was intermingledwith the tramp of horse as menatarms wentout and returned with steeds hard ridden andcovered with foam she observed too that suchdomestics as she casually saw from her windowwere in arms all this made her heart throbhigh for it augured the approach of rescue andbesides the bustle left the little garden morelonely than ever at length the hour of noonarrived she had taken care to provide underpretence of her own wishes which the pantherseemed disposed to indulge such articles offood as could be the most easily conveyed to theunhappy captive she whispered to intimateher presence there was no answer she spokelouder still there was silencehe sleeps she muttered these words halfaloud and with a shuddering which was succeededby a start and a scream when a voicereplied behind her yes he sleeps but it is for evershe looked round sir john ramorny stoodbehind her in complete armour but the visorof his helmet was up and displayed a countenancemore resembling one about to die thanto fight he spoke with a grave tone somethingbetween that of a calm observer of an interestingevent and of one who is an agent andpartaker in itcatharine he said all is true which istell you he is dead you have done your bestfor him you can do no morei will not i cannot believe it

been hurried from their residence withouthaving time to announce to henry smitheither their departure or the alarming cause ofit when therefore the lover appeared in curfewstreet on the morning of their flight insteadof the hearty welcome of the honest burgherand the april reception half joy half censurewhich he had been promised on the partof his lovely daughter he received only the astoundingintelligence that her father and shehad set off early on the summons of a strangerwho had kept himself carefully muffled fromobservation to this dorothy whose talents forforestalling evil and communicating her viewsof it are known to the reader chose to add thatshe had no doubt her master and young mistresswere bound for the highlands to avoid avisit which had been made since their departureby two or three apparitors who in the name ofa commission appointed by the king hadsearched the house put seals upon such placesas were supposed to contain papers and leftcitations for father and daughter to appear beforethe court of commission on a day certain underpain of outlawry all these alarming particularsdorothy took care to state in the gloomiestcolours and the only consolation which she affordedthe alarmed lover was that her masterhad charged her to tell him to reside quietly atperth and that he should soon hear news ofthem this checked the smith's first resolvewhich was to follow them instantly to thehighlands and partake the fate which theymight encounterbut when he recollected his repeated feudswith divers of the clan quhele and particularlyhis personal quarrel with conachar who wasnow raised to he a high chief he could not butthink on reflection that his intrusion on theirplace of retirement was more likely to disturbthe safety which they might otherwise enjoythere than be of any service to them he waswell acquainted with simon's habitual intimacywith the chief of the clan quhele and justlyaugured that the glover would obtain protectionwhich his own arrival might be likelyto disturb while his personal prowess couldlittle avail him in a quarrel with a whole tribeof vindictive mountaineers at the same timehis heart throbbed with indignation when hethought of catharine being within the absolutepower of young conachar whose rivalryhe could not doubt and who had now so manymeans of urging his suit what if the youngchief should make the safety of the father dependon the favour of the daughter he distrustednot catharine's affections but thenleer mode of thinking was so disinterested andher affection to her father so tender that if thelove she bore her suitor was weighed against hissecurity or perhaps his life it was matter ofdeep and awful doubt whether it might not befound light in the balance tormented bythoughts on which we need not dwell he resolvednevertheless to remain at home stifle hisanxiety as he might and await the promised intelligencefrom the old man it came but itdid not relieve his concernsir patrick charteris had not forgotten hispromise to communicate to the smith the plansof the fugitives but amid the bustle occasionedby the movement of troops he couldnot himself convey the intelligence he thereforeintrusted to his agent kitt henshaw thetask of making it known but this worthyperson as the reader knows was in the interestof raraorny whose business it was to concealfrom every one but especially from a loverso active and daring as henry the real placeof catharine's residence henshaw therefore announcedto the anxious smith that his friend theglover was secure in the highlands and thoughhe affected to be more reserved on the subjectof catharine he said little to contradict the beliefthat she as well as simon shared the protectionof the clan quhele but he reiteratedin the name of sir patrick assurances thatfather and daughter were both well and thathenry would best consult his own interest andtheir safety by remaining quiet and waitingthe course of eventswith an agonized heart therefore henrygow determined to remain quiet till he hadmore certain intelligence and employed himselfin finishing a shirt of mail which he intendedshould be the best tempered and the most finelypolished that his skilful hands had ever executedthis exercise of his craft pleased him betterthan any other occupation which he could haveadopted and served as an apology for secludinghimself in his workshop and shunning societywhere the idle reports which were daily circulatedserved only to perplex and disturb himhe resolved to trust in the warm regard of simonthe faith of his daughter and the friendship of the provost who having so highly commendedhis valour in the combat with bonthrowwould never he thought desert him atthis extremity of his fortunes time howeverpassed on day by day and it was not tillpalm sunday was near approaching that sirpatrick charteris having entered the city tomake some arrangements for the ensuing combatbethought himself of making a visit to thesmith of the wyndhe entered his workshop with an air of sympathyunusual to him and which made henryinstantly augur that he brought bad newsthe smith caught the alarm and the upliftedhammer was arrested in its descent upon theheated iron while the agitated arm that wieldedit strong before as that of a giant becameso powerless that it was with difficulty henrywas able to place the weapon on the groundinstead of dropping it from his handmy poor henry said sir patrick ibring you but cold news they are uncertainhowever and if true they are such as a braveman like you should not take too deeply toheartvol iii rin god's name my lord said henry itrust you bring no evil news of simon gloveror his daughter touching themselves said sir patrickno they are safe and well but as to theehenry my tidings are more cold kitt henshawhas i think apprised thee that i had endeavouredto provide catharine glover with asafe protection in the house of an honourablelady the duchess of rothsay but she hathdeclined the charge and catharine hath beensent to her father in the highlands what isworst is to come thou mayest have heard thatgilchrist maclan is dead and that his soneachin who was known in perth as the apprenticeof old simon by the name of conacharis now the chief of clan quhelp and i heardfrom one of my domestics that there is a strongrumour among the maclean that the youngchief seeks the hand of catharine in marriagemy domestic learned this as a secret howeverwhile in the breadalbane country on some arrangementstouching the ensuing combat thething is uncertain but henry it wears a faceof likelihood did your lordship's servant see simonglover and his daughter said henry strugglingfor breath and coughing to conceal fromthe provost the excess of his agitationhe did not said sir patrick the highlandersseemed jealous and refused to permithim to speak to the old man and he feared toalarm them by asking to see catharine besideshe talks no gaelic nor had his informer muchenglish so there may be some mistake in thematter nevertheless there is such a report andi thought it best to tell it you but you maybewell assured that the wedding cannot goontill the affair of palm sunday be over andi advise you to take no step till we learn thecircumstances of the matter for certainty ismost desirable even when it is a painful onego you to the councilhouses he added aftera pause to speak about the preparations forthe lists in the north inch you will be welcomethereno my good lordwell smith i judge by your brief answerthat you are discomposed with this matterbut after all women are weathercocksthat is the truth on't solomon and others haveproved it before youand so sir patrick charteris retired fullyconvinced he had discharged the office of a comforterin the most satisfactory manner with very different impressions did the unfortunatelover regard the tidings and listen tothe consoling commentarythe provost he said bitterly to himself is an excellent man marry he holds hisknighthood so high that if he speaks nonsensea poor man must hold it sense as he must praisedead ale if it be handed to him in his lordship'ssilver flaggon how would all this sound inanother situation suppose i were rolling downthe steep descent of the corrichie diu and beforei came to the edge of the rock comes mylord provost and cries henry there is a deepprecipice and i grieve to say you are in the fairwayof rolling over it but be not downcastfor heaven may send a stone or a bush to stopyour progress however i thought it would becomfort to you to know the worst which youwill be presently aware of i do not know howmany hundred feet deep the precipice descendsbut you may form a judgment when you are atthe bottom for certainty is certainty and harkyewhen come you to take a game at bowls and this gossip is to serve instead of any friendlyattempt to save the poor wight's neck wheni think of this i could go mad seize my hammerand break and destroy all around me buti will be

thereforesurprised at seeing a tall and powerfulihighlander peering anxiously about the wyndin which he lived in the manner in which thenatives of a wild country examine the curiositiesof one that is

at noon the two bands representingthe contending clans arrived at theseveral points where they were to halt for refreshmentsthe clan quhele was entertained hospitablyat the rich abbey of scone while the provostregaled their rivals at his castle of kinfauns the utmost care being taken to treat both partieswith the most punctilious attention and toafford neither an opportunity of complainingof

latter patronisingthe clan quhele messengers were passingcontinually from the one earl to the otherand they held more than six meetings withinthirty hours before the ceremonial of the fieldcould be

half a mile of the place wherethe highlanders were quartered while on theirpart the intended combatants were prohibitedfrom approaching perth without special licensetroops were stationed to enforce this orderwho did their charge so scrupulously as to preventsimon glover himself burgess and citizenof perth from approaching the town becausehe owned having come thither at the same timewith the

eachin himself interfered histimidity it must be observed was not of thatsordid and selfish nature which induces thosewho are infected by it calmly to submit to dishonourrather than risk clanger on the contraryhe was morally brave though constitutionallytimid and the shame of avoiding thecombat became at the moment more powerfulthan the fear of facing iti will not hear he said of a schemewhich

thatthe dauntless smith was about to fight withoutarmour when just as the fated hour was approachingthe shrill voice of a female was heardscreaming for passage through the crowd themultitude gave place to her importunity andshe advanced breathless with haste under theburden of a mail hauberk and a large twohandedsword the widow of oliver proudfatewas soon recognised and the arms whichbhe bore were those of the smith himself whichoccupied by her husband on the fatal eveningwhen he was murdered had been naturallyconveyed to his house with the dead body andwere now by the exertions of his grateful widowbrought to the lists at a moment whensuch proved weapons were of the last consequenceto their owner henry joyfully receivedthe wellknown arms and the widow with tremblinghaste assisted in putting them on andthen took leave of him saying god for theorphans champion and ill luck to all whocome before him confident at feeling himself in his wellprovedarmour henry shook himself as if to settlethe steel shirt around him and unsheathing thetwohanded sword made it flourish over hishead cutting the air through which it whistledin the form of the figure eight with an easeand sleight of hand that proved how powerfullyand skilfully he could wield the ponderousweapon the champions were now ordered tomarch in their turns around the lists crossingeo as to avoid meeting each other and makingobeisance as they passed the golden arbourwhere the king was seatedwhile this course was performing most ofthe spectators were again curiously comparingthe stature limbs and sinews of the two partiesand endeavouring to form a conjecture as tothe probable issue of the combat the feud ofa hundred years with all its acts of aggressionand retaliation was concentrated in the bosomof each combatant their countenances seemedfiercely writhen into the wildest expression ofpride hate and a desperate purpose of fightingto the very lastthe spectators murmured a joyful applausein highwrought expectation of the bloody gamewagers were offered and accepted both on thegeneral issue of the conflict and on the feats ofparticular champions the clear frank and elatedlook of henry smith rendered him a generalfavourite among the spectators and odds touse the modern expression were taken that hewould kill three of his opponents before he himselffell scarcely was the smith equipped for thecombat when the commands of the chiefs orderedthe champions into their places and at thesame moment henry heard the voice of simonglover issuing from the crowd who were nowsilent with expectation and calling on himharry smith harry smith what madnesshath possessed thee ay he wishes to save his hopeful soninlawthat is or is to be from the smith's handlingwas henry's first thought his secondwas to turn and speak with him and his thirdthat he could on no pretext desert the bandwhich he had joined or even seem desirous todelay the fight consistently with honourhe turned himself therefore to the businessof the hour both parties were disposed bythe respective chiefs in three lines each containingten men they were arranged with suchintervals between each individual as offered himscope to wield his sword the blade of which wasfive feet long not including the handle the secondand third lines were to come up as reservesin case the first experienced disaster on theright of the array of clan quhele the chiefeachin maclan placed himself in the secondline betwixt two of his fosterbrothers fourof them occupied the right of the first linewhilst the father and two others protected therear of the beloved chieftain torquil in particularkept close behind for the purpose of coveringhim thus eachin stood in the centre ofnine of the strongest men of his band havingfour especial defenders in front one on eachhand and three in his rearthe line of the clan chattan was arrangedin precisely the same order only that the chiefoccupied the centre of the middle rank insteadof being on the extreme right this inducedhenry smith who saw in the opposing bandsonly one enemy and that was the unhappy eachin to propose placing himself on the left ofthe front rank of the clan chattan but theleader disapproved of this arrangement andhaving reminded henry that he owed him obedienceas having taken wages at his hand hecommanded him to occupy the space in the thirdline immediately behind himself a post of honourcciuiiiily which henry could not declinethough he accepted of it with reluctancewhen the clans were thus drawn up opposedto each other they intimated their feudal animosityand their eagerness to engage by a wildscream which uttered by the clan quhele wasanswered and echoed back by the clan chattanthe whole at the same time shaking their swordsand menacing each other as if they meant toconquer the imagination of their opponents erethey mingled in the actual strifeat this trying moment torquil who hadnever feared for himself was agitated withalarm on the part of his dault yet consoled byobserving that he kept a determined posture and that the few words which he spoke to hisclan were delivered boldly and well calculatedto animate them to combat as expressinghis resolution to partake their fate in death orvictory but there was no time for further observationthe trumpets of the king sounded acharge the bagpipes blew up their screamingand maddening notes and the combatants startingforward in regular order and increasingtheir pace till they came to a smart run met togetherin the centre of the ground as a furioustorrent encounters an advancing tidefor an instant or two the front lines hewingat each other with their long swords seemedengaged in a succession of single combats but the second and third ranks soon came uponeither side actuated alike by the eagernessof hatred and the thirst of honour pressedthrough the intervals and rendered thescene a tumultuous chaos over which the hugeswords rose and sunk some still glitteringothers streaming with blood appearing

long weapons had alreadybetaken themselves to their poniards and endeavouredto get within the swordsweep ofthose opposed to them in the meantime bloodflowed fast and the groans of those who fell beganto mingle with the cries of those who fought for according to the manner of the highlandersat all times they could hardly be said to shoutbut to yell those of the spectators whose eyeswere best accustomed to such scenes of bloodand confusion could nevertheless discover noadvantage yet acquired by either party theconflict swayed indeed at different intervalsforwards or backwards butit was only in momentarysuperiority which the party who acquiredit almost instantly lost by a correspondingexertion on the other side the wild notesof the pipers were still heard above the tumultand stimulated to farther exertions the fury ofthe combatantsat once however and as if by mutual agreementthe instruments sounded a retreat it wasexpressed in wailing notes which seemed to implya dirge for the fallen the two parties disengagedthemselves from each other to takebreath for a few minutes the eyes of the spectatorsgreedily surveyed the shattered array ofthe combatants as they drew off from the contestbut found it still impossible to decide whichhad sustained the greater loss it seemed as ifthe clan chattan had lost rather fewer menthan their antagonists but in compensationthe bloody plaids and shirts of their party forseveral on both sides had thrown their mantlesaway showed more wounded men than theclan qahele about twenty of both sides layon the field dead or dying and arras and legslopped off heads cleft to the chine slashes deepthrough the shoulder into the breast showedat once the fury of the combat the ghastly characterof the weapons used and the fatal
