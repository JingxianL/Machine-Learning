springfall which shouldbar their escape his lordship himself being thegreat grimalkin to whom they arc to be givenover to be devoureddared cromwell mention this to thee in expressterms said everard pulling up historicand stopping in the midst of the road woodstocknay not in express terms which i do notbelieve he ever used in his life you might aswell expect a drunken man to go straight forwardbut he insinuated as much to me andindicated that you might deserve well of him gatzo the damnable proposal sticks in mythroat by betraying our noble and rightfulking here he pulled oflp his hat whom godgrant in health and wealth long to reign as theworthy clergyman says though i fear just nowhis majesty is both sick and sorry and never apenny in his pouch to bootthis tallies with what alice hinted saideverard but how could she know it didstthou give her any hint of such a thing i replied the cavalier i who never sawmistress alice in my life till tonight and thenonly for an instant zooks man how is that possibletrue replied everard and seemed lost inthought at length he spoke i should callcromwell to account for his bad opinion of me for even though not seriously expressed but asi am convinced it was with the sole view of prowoodstockwing you and perhaps myself it was neverthelessa misconstruction to be resentedi'll carry a cartel for you with all my heartand soul said wildrake and turn out withhis godliness second with as good will as i everdrank a glass of sackpshaw replied everard those in his highplace fight no singular combats but tell meroger wildrake didst thou thyself think me capableof the falsehood and treachery implied insuch a message i exclaimed wildrake markham everardyou have been my early friend my constantbenefactor when colchester was reduced yousaved me from the gallows and since that thouhast twenty times saved me from starving butby heaven if i thought you capable of such villainyas your general recommended by yonderblue sky and all the works of creation which itbends over i would stab you with my ownhand death replied everard i should indeeddeserve but not from you perhaps but fortunatelyi cannot if i would be guilty of the woodstocktreachery you would punish know that i hadthis day secret notice and from cromwell himselfthat the young man has escaped by sea frombristolnow god almighty be blessed who protectedhim through so many dangers exclaimedwildrake huzza up hearts cavaliers hey for cavaliers god bless king charles moon and stars catch my hat and he threwit up as high as he could into the air the celestialbodies which he invoked did not receivethe present dispatched to them but as in thecase of sir henry lee's scabbard an old gnarledoak became a second time the receptacle of awaif and stray of loyal enthusiasm wildrakelooked rather foolish at the circumstance andhis friend took the opportunity of admonishinghimart thou not ashamed to bear thee so like aschoolboy why said wildrake i have but sent apuritan's hat upon a loyal errand i laugh tothink how many of the schoolboys thou talk'st ofwill be cheated into climbing the pollard nextwoodstock siyear expecting to find the nest of some unknownbird in yonder unmeasured margin of felthush now for god's sake and let us speakcalmly said everard charles has escapedand i am glad of it i would willingly have seenhim on his father's throne by composition butnot by the force of the scottish army and theincensed and vengeful royalists master markham everard began the cavalierinterrupting himnay hush dear wildrake said everard let us not dispute a point on which we cannotagree and give me leave to go on i say sincethe young man has escaped cromwell offensiveand injurious stipulation falls to the ground andi see not why my uncle and his family shouldnot again enter their own house under the sameterms of connivance as many other royalistswhat may be incumbent on me is different norcan i determine my course until i have an interviewwith the general which as i think willend in his confessing that he threw in this offensiveproposal to sound us both it is much in hisuit woodstockmanner for he is blunt and never sees or feelsthe punctilious honour which the gallants of theday stretch to such delicacy acquit him for having any punctilioabout him said wildrake either touchinghonour or honesty now to come back to wherewe started supposing you were not to reside inperson at the lodge and to forbear even visitingthere unless on invitation when such a thingcan be brought about i tell you frankly i thinkyour uncle and his daughter might be inducedto come back to the lodge and reside there asusual at least the clergyman that worthy oldcock gave me to hope as muchhe had been hasty in bestowing his confinehence said everardtrue replied wildrake he confided inin me at once for he instantly saw my regardfor the church i thank heaven i never passeda clergyman in his canonicals without pulling myhat off and thou knowest the most desperateduel lever fought was with young gray less of theinner temple for taking the wall of the reverenddr dunce ah i can gain a chaplain's ear inwoodstockscanty gadzooks they know whom they haveto trust to in such a one as idost thou think then said colonel everard or rather does this clergyman think thatif they were secure of intrusion from me the familywould return to the lodge supposing theintruding commissioners gone and this nocturnaldisturbance explained and ended the old knight answered wildrake maybewrought upon by the doctor to return if heis secure against intrusion as for disturbancesthe stout old boy so far as i can learn in twominutes conversation laughs at all this turmoilas the work of mere imagination the consequenceof the remorse of their own evil consciences and says that goblin or devil was never heard ofat woodstock until it became the residence ofsuch men as they who have now usurped the possessionsthere is more than imagination in it saideverard i have personal reason to know thereis some conspiracy carrying on to render thehouse untenantable by the commissioners i acquitmy uncle of accession to such a silly trick vol ii c woodstockbut i must see it ended ere i can agree to hisand my cousin's residing where such a confederacyexists for they are likely to be consideredas the contrivers of such pranks be the actualagent who he maywith reverence to your better acquaintancewith the gentleman everard i should rathersuspect the old father of puritans i beg yourpardon again has something to do with the business and if so lucifer will never look nearthe true old knight's beard nor abide a glanceof yonder maiden's innocent blue eyes i willuphold them as safe as pure gold in a miser'schestsafest thou aught thyself which makes theethink thus not a quill of the devil's pinion saw i repliedwildrake he supposes himself too secureof an old cavalier who must steal hang or drownin the long run so he gives himself no trouble tolook after the assured booty but i heard theservingfellows prate of what they had seen andheard and though their tales were confusedenough yet if there was any truth among themwoodstockat all i should say the devil must have been inthe dance but hollo here comes some oneupon us stand friend who art thou a poor daylabourer in the great work ofengland joseph tomkins by name secretaryto a godly

and a pouringforth and prithee tell me in brief what is the matterwhere is thy master and in a word what hashappened my master is close by parading it in thelittle meadow beside the hugeous oak which iscalled by the name of the late man ride but twosteps forward and you may see him walkingwooijstocifswiftly to and fro advancing all the while thenaked weaponupon proceeding as directed but with as littlenoise as possible they descried a man whomof course they concluded must be harrisonwalking to and fro beneath the king's oak as asentinel under arms but with more wildness ofdemeanour the tramp of the horses did notescape his ear and they heard him call out asif at the head of the brigade lower pikesagainst cavalry here comes prince rupertstandfast and you shall turn them aside as abull would toss a curdog lower your pikesstill my hearts the end secured against your footdown on your right knee front rank sparenot for the spoiling of your blue aprons ha zerobabel ay that is the wordin the name of heaven about whom orwhat is he talking said everard whereforedoes he go about with his weapon drawn truly sir when aught disturbs my mastergeneral harrison he is something rapt in thespirit and conceives that he is commanding a reserveof pikes at the great battle of armageddonand for his weapon alack worthy sir whereforewoodstock sshould he keep sheffield steel in calves leatherwhen there are fiends to be combated incarnatefiends on earth and raging infernal fiends underthe earth this is intolerable said everard listento me tomkins thou art not now in thepulpit and i desire none of thy preaching languagei know thou canst speak intelligiblywhen thou art so minded remember i mayserve or harm thee and as you hope or fear anythingon my part answer straightforward what has happened to drive out thy master tothe wild wood at this time of night forsooth worthy and honoured sir i willspeak with the precision i may true it is andof verity that the breath of man which is in hisnostrils goeth forth and returned hark you sir said colonel everard takecare where you ramble in your correspondencewith me you have heard how at the great battleof dunbar in scotland the general himselfheld a pistol to the head of lieutenant hewcreedthreatening to shoot him through the brainif he did not give up holding forth and put hissquadron in line to the front take care sir v i vj o woodstockverily the lieutenant then charged with aneven and unbroken order said tomkins andbore a thousand plaids and bonnets over thebeach before him into the sea neither shall ipretermit or postpone your honour's commandsbut speedily obey them and that without delay go to fellow thou knowest what i wouldhave said everard speak at once i knowthou canst if thou wilt trusty tomkins is betterknown than he thinks forworthy sir said tomkins in a much lessperiphrastic style i will obey your worship asfar as the spirit will permit truly it was not anhour since when my worshipful master being attable with master bibbet and myself not tomention the worshipful master bletson and coloneldesborough and behold there was a violentknocking at the gate as of one in haste now ofa certainty so much had our household beenharassed with witches and spirits and other objectsof sound and sight that the sentinels couldnot be brought to abide upon their posts withoutdoors and it was only by provision of beef andstrong liquors that we were able to maintaina guard of three men in the hall who neverthewoodstock less ventured not to open the door lest theyshould be surprised with some of the goblinswherewith their imaginations were overwhelmedand they heard the knocking which increaseduntil it seemed that the door was well nigh aboutto be beaten down worthy master bibbet was alittle overcome with liquor as is his fashion goodmanabout this time of the evening not that heis in the least given to ebriety but simply thatsince the scottish campaign he hath had a perpetualague which obliges him so to nourish hisframe against the damps of the night whereforeas it is well known to your honour that idischarge the office of a faithful servant as wellto majorgeneral harrison and the other commissionersas to my just and lawful master coloneldesborough i know all that and now that thou arttrusted by both i pray to heaven thou may'stmerit the trust said colonel everardand devoutly do i pray said tomkinsthat your worshipful prayers may be answeredwith favour for certainly to be and to be calledand entitled honest joe and trusty tomkinsis to me more than ever would be an ears title woodstockweresuch things to be granted anew in this regeneratedgovernmentwell go on go on or if thou tallest muchlonger i will make bold to dispute the article ofyour honesty i like short tales sir and doubtwhat is told with a long unnecessary train ofwordswell good sir be not hasty as i said beforethedoors rattled till you would have thoughtthe knocking was reiterated in every room ofthe palace the bell rung out for companythough we could not find that any one tolled theclapper and the guards let off their firelock merelybecause they knew not what better to do somaster bibbet being as i said unsusceptible ofhis duty i went down with my poor rapier to thedoor and demanded who was there and i wasanswered in a voice which i must say wasmuch like another voice that it was one wantingmajorgeneral harrison so as it was then latei answered mildly that general harrison wasbetaking himself to his rest and that any whowished to speak to him must return on the morrowmorning for that after nightfall the door ofthe palace being in the room of a garrison wouldwoodstock be opened to no one so the voice replied andbid me open directly without which he wouldblow the folding leaves of the door into the middleof the hall and therewithal the noise recommencedthat we thought the house wouldhave fallen and i was in some measure constrainedto open the door even like a besieged garrisonwhich can hold out no longerby my honour and it was stoutly done of youi must say said wildrake who had been listeningwith much interest i am a bold daredevilenough yet when i had two inches of oak plankbetween the actual fiend and me hang him thatwould demolish the barrier between us say ii would as soon when aboard bore a hole in theship and let in the waves for you know we alwayscompare the devil to the deep seaspr'ythee peace wildrake said everardand let him on with his history well andwhat saw'st thou when the door was opened the great devil with his horns and claws thouwilt say no doubt no sir i will say nothing but what is true when i undid the door one man stood thereand he to seeming a man of no extraordinary woodstockappearance he was wrapped in a taffeta cloakof a scarlet colour and with a red lining heseemed as if he might have been in his time avery handsome man but there was something ofpaleness and sorrow in his face a long lovelockand long hair he wore even after the abominationof the cavaliers and the unloveliness aslearned master prynne well termed it of lovelocks a jewel in his ear a blue scarf over hisshoulder like a military commander for the kingand a hat with a white plume bearing a peculiarhatbandsome unhappy officer of cavaliers of whomso many are in hiding and seeking shelter throughthe country briefly replied everardtrue worthy sir right as a judicious expositionbut there was something about thisman if he was a man whom i for one couldnot look upon without trembling nor the musketeerswho were in the hall without betrayingmuch alarm and swallowing as they themselvesswill aver the very bullets which they had intheir mouths for loading their carabines and musketsnay the wolf and deerdogs that arewoodstock the fiercest of their kind fled from this visitorand crept into holes and corners moaning andwailing in a low and broken tone he cameinto the middle of the hall and still he seemedno more than an ordinary man only somewhatfantastically dressed in a doublet of black velvetpinked upon scarlet satin under his cloak a jewelin his ear with large roses in his shoes and akerchief in his hand which he sometimes pressedagainst his left sidegracious heaven said wildrake comingclose up to everard and whispering in his earwith accents which terror rendered tremulous amood of mind most unusual to the daring manwho seemed now overcome by it it must havebeen poor dick robinson the player in the verydress in which i have seen him play pilaster ay and drank a jolly bottle with him after it atthe mermaid i remember how many frolickswe had together and all his little fantastic fashionshe served for his old master charlesin mohun's troop and was murdered by thisbutcher's dog as i have heard after surrenderat the battle of nasebyfield woodstockhush i have heard of the deed said everard for god's sake hear the man to an enddid this visitor speak to thee my friend yes sir in a pleasing tone of voice butsomewhat fanciful in the articulation and likeone who is speaking to an audience as from abar or a pulpit more than in the voice of ordinarymen on ordinary matters he desired tosee majorgeneral harrisonhe did and you said everard infectedby the spirit of the time which as is well knownleaned to credulity upon all matters of supernaturalagency what did you do i went up to the parlour and related thatsuch a person inquired for him he started wheni told him and eagerly desired to know theman's dress but no sooner did i mention hisdress and the jewel in his ear than he saidbegone tell him i will not admit him to speechof me say that i defy him and will make mydefiance good at the great battle in the valley ofarmageddon when the voice of the angel shallcall all fowls which fly under the face of heavento feed on the flesh of the captain and the soilswoodstocktier the warhorse and his rider say to theevil one i have power to appeal our conflicteven till that day and that in the front of thatfearful day he will again meet with harrisoni went back with this answer to the strangerand his face was writhed into such a deadlyfrown as a mere human brow hath seldom wornreturn to him he said and say it is myhour and that if he come not instantly down tospeak with me i will mount the stairs to himsay that i command him to descend by the tokenthat on the field of naseby he did not thework negligently i have heard whispered wildrake whofelt more and more strongly the contagion of superstition that these words were blasphemouslyused by harrison when he shot my poorfriend dickwhat happened next said everard seethat thou speaks the truthas gospel expounded by a steeplemansaid the independent yet truly it is but littlei have to say i saw my master come downwith a blank yet resolved air and when he enteredthe hall and saw the stranger he made a woodstockpause the other waved on him as if to followand walked out at the portal my worthy patronseemed as if he were about to follow yetagain paused when this visitant be he man orfiend reentered and said obey thy doomby pathless march by greenwood treeit is thy weird to follow me to follow me through the ghastly moonlight to follow me through the shadows of night to follow me comrade still art thou bound i conjure thee by the untouched woundi conjure thee by the last words i spokewhen the body slept and the spirit awokein the very last pangs of the deadly strokeso saying he stalked out and my master followedhim into the wood i followed also at adistance but when i came up my master wasalone and bearing himself as you now beholdhimthou hast had a wonderful memory friendsaid the colonel coldly to remember theserhymes in a single recitation there seems somethingof practice in all thisa single recitation my honoured sir exclaimedthe independent alack the rhyme isseldom out of my poor master's mouth when assometimes laps he is less triumphant in hiswoodstock wrestles with satan but it was the first time ever heard it uttered by another and to saytruth he ever seems to repeat it unwillingly as achild after his pedagogue and as it was not inditedby his own head as the psalmist saithit is strange said everard i have heardand read that the spirits of the slaughtered havestrange power over the slayer but i am astonishedto believe there may be truth in such talesroger wildrake what art thou afraid ofman why dost thou shift thy place thus fear it is not fear it is hate deadly hatei see the murderer of poor dick before meand see he throws himself into a posture of fencesa sa say'st thou brood of a butcher's mastiffsthou shalt not want an antagonistere any one could stop him wildrake threwaside his cloak drew his sword and almost witha single bound cleared the distance betwixt himand harrison and crossed swords with the latteras he stood brandishing his weapon as if inimmediate expectation of an assailant accordinglythe republican general was not for aninstant taken at unawares but the moment theswords clashed he shouted ha i feel thee woodstocknow thou hast come in body at last welcome welcome the sword of the lord and of gideon part them part them cried everard as heand tom king at first astonished at the suddennessof the affray hastened to interfere everardseizing on the cavalier drew him forcibly backwardswhile tomkins contrived with risk anddifficulty to master harrison's sword while thegeneral exclaimed ha two to one two toone thus fight demons wildrakeon his sideswore a dreadful oath and added markhamyou have cancelled every obligation i owed you they are all out of sight gone d n me you have indeed acquitted these obligationsrarely said everard who knows how thisaffair shall be explained and answered i will answer it with my ife said wildrakegood now be silent said tomkins andlet me manage it shall be so ordered that thegood general shall never know that he hath encounteredwith a mortal man only let that manof moab put his sword into the scabbard's restand be stillwoodstock wildrake let me entreat thee to sheathe thysword said everard else on my life thoumust turn it against meno fore george not so mad as that neitherbut i'll have another day with him thou another day exclaimed harrisonwhose eye had still remained fixed on the spotwhere he found such palpable resistance yesi know thee well day by day week by weekthou makes the same idle request for thouknowest that my heart quivers at thy voice but my hand trembles not when opposed to thinethe spirit is willing to the combat if the fleshbe weak when opposed to that which is not ofthe fleshnow peace all for heaven's sake saidthe steward tomkins then added addressinghis master there is no one here if it pleaseyour excellence but tomkins and the worthycolonel everardgeneral harrison as sometimes happens incases of partial insanity that is supposing histo have been a case of mental delusion thoughvol ii d woodstockfirmly and entirely persuaded of the truth of hisown visions yet was not willing to speak on thesubject to those who he knew would regard themas imaginary upon this occasion he assumedthe appearance of perfect ease and composureafter the violent agitation he had just manifestedin a manner which showed how anxious he was todisguise his real feelings from everard whom heconsidered as unlikely to participate themhe saluted the colonel with profound ceremonyand talked of the fineness of the eveningwhich had summoned him forth of the lodge totake a turn in the park and enjoy the favourableweather he then took everard by the arm andwalked back with him towards the lodge wildrakeand tomkins following close behind andleading the horses everard desirous to gainsome light on these mysterious incidents endeavouredto come on the subject more than once bya mode of interrogation which harrison for madmenare very often unwilling to enter on the subjectof their mental delusion parried with someskill or addressed himself for aid to his stewardtomkins who was in the habit of seeing voucherwoodstock for his master upon all occasions which led todesirous's ingenious nickname of gibbetand wherefore had you your sword drawnmy worthy general said everard when youwere only on an evening walk of pleasure truly excellent colonel these are timeswhen men must watch with their loins girdedand their lights burning and their weaponsdrawn the day draweth nigh believe me or notas you will that men must watch lest they befound naked and unarmed when the seven trumpetsshall sound boot and saddle and the pipesof jeer shall strike up horse and away true good general but methought i sawyou making passes even now as if you were fightingsaid everardi am of a strange fantasy friend everardanswered harrison and when i walk aloneand happen as but now to have my weapondrawn i sometimes for exercise sake will practisea thrust against such a tree as that it is asilly pride men have in the use of weapons ihave been accounted a master of fence and havefought prizes when i was unregenerate and woodstockbefore i was called to do my part in the greatwork entering as a trooper into our victoriousgeneral's first regiment of horsebut methought said everard i heard aweapon clash with yours how a weapon clash with my sword how could that be tomkins truly sir said tomkins it must havebeen a bough of the tree they have them of allkinds here and your honour may have pushedagainst one of them which the brazilians callironwood a block of which being struck with ahammer saith purchas in his pilgrimage ringethlike an anvil truly it may be so said harrison forthese rulers who are gone assembled in this theirabode of pleasure many strange trees and plantsthough they gathered not of the fruit of thattree which beareth twelve manner of fruits orof those leaves which are the healing of the nationseverard pursued his investigation for he wasstruck with the manner in which harrison evadedhis questions and the dexterity with whichwoodstock lie threw his transcendental and fanatical notionslike a sort of veil over the darker visions excitedby remorse and conscious guiltbut said he if i may trust my eyes andears i cannot but still think that you had a realantagonist nay i am sure i saw a fellow in adarkcoloured jerkin retreat through the wooddid you said harrison with a tone ofsurprise while his voice faltered in spite of himwho could he be tomkins did you see thefellow colonel everard talks of with the napkinin his hand the bloody napkin which he alwayspressed to his side this last expression in which harrison gavea mark different from that which everard hadassigned but corresponding to tomkins's originaldescription of the supposed spectre had moreeffect on everard in confirming the steward'sstory than anything he had witnessed or heardthe voucher answered the draft upon him aspromptly as usual that he had seen such a fellowglide past them into the thicket that he daresayhe was some deerstealer for he had heard theywere become very audacious woodstocklook ye there now master everard saidharrison hurrying from the subject is it nottime now that we should lay aside our controversiesand join hand in hand to repairing thebreaches of our zion happy and contentedwere i my excellent friend to be a reader ofmortar or a bearer of a hod upon this occasionunder our great leader with whom providencehas gone forth in this great national controversy and truly so devoutly do i hold by our excellentand victorious general oliver whom heavenlong preserve that were he to command me ishould not scruple to pluck forth of his highplace the man whom they call speaker even asi lent a poor hand to pluck down the man whomthey called king wherefore as i know yourjudgment holdeth with mine on this matter letrae urge unto you lovingly that we may act as brethrenand build up the breaches and reestablishthe bulwarks of our english zion whereby weshall be doubtless chosen as pillars and buttressesunder our excellent lord general for supportingand sustaining the same and endowed withproper revenues and incomes both spiritual andmoodstotx temporal to serve as a pedestal on which wemay stand seeing that otherwise our foundationwill be on the loose sand nevertheless continuedhe his mind again diverging from hisviews of temporal ambition into his visions ofthe fifth monarchy these things are but vanityin respect of the opening of the book whichis sealed for all things approach speedily towardslightning and thundering and unloosing of thegreat dragon from the bottomless pit wherein heis chainedwith this mingled strain of earthly politicsand fanatical prediction harrison so overpoweredcolonel everard as to leave him no time to urgelira further on the particular circumstances ofhis nocturnal skirmish concerning which it isplain he had no desire to be interrogated theynow reached the lodge of woodstock woodstockchapter iiinow the wasted brands do glowwhile the screechowl sounding loudputs the wretch that lies in woein remembrance of a shroudnow it is the time of nightthat the graves all gaping widelivery one lets out its spritein the churchway paths to glidemidsummer night's dreambefore the gate of the palace the guards werenow doubled everard demanded the reason ofthis from the corporal whom he found in the hallwith his soldiers sitting or sleeping around a greatfire maintained at the expense of the carvedchairs and benches with fragments of which itwas furnishedwhy verily answered the man the corpsde garde as your worship says will be harassedto pieces by such dujy nevertheless fear hathwoodstock gone abroad among us and no one man willmount guard alone we have drawn in howeverone or two of our outposts from banburyand elsewhere and we are to have a relief fromoxford tomorroweverard continued minute inquiries concerningthe sentinels that were posted within aswell as without the castle and found that asthey had been stationed under the eye of harrisonhimself the rules of prudent discipline hadbeen exactly observed in the distribution of theposts there remained nothing therefore for coloneleverard to do excepting that rememberinghis own adventure of the evening to recommendthat an additional sentinel should be placed witha companion if judged indispensable in that vestibuleor antiroom from which the long gallerywhere he had met with the rencounter and othersuites of apartments diverged the corporal respectfullypromised all obedience to his ordersthe servingmen being called appeared also indouble force

this dear everard my fears for thee willkeep me awake else for i know that notwithstandingyour excellent sense you entertain someof those superstitious ideas which we suck inwith our mother's milk and which constitute theground of our fears in situations like the present therefore leave thy door open if you love me thatyou may have ready assistance from me in caseof needmy masters said wildrake trusts firstin his bible sir and then in his good swordhe has no idea that the devil can be baffled bythe charm of two men lying in one room stillless that the foul fiend can be argued out of

everard taking off the most cumbrouspart of his dress lay down in his hose and doubletand composed himself to resthe was awakened from sleep by a slow andsolemn strain of music which died away as at adistance he started up and felt for his armswhich he found close beside him his temporarybed being without curtains he could lookaround him without difficulty but as there remainedin the chimney only a few red embers ofthe fire which he had arranged before he went tosleep it was impossible he could discern anythinghe felt therefore in spite of his naturalcourage that undefined and thrilling species ofwoodstock tremor which attends a sense that danger is nearand an uncertainty concerning its cause and characterreluctant as hews to yield belief to supernaturaloccurrences we have already said he wasnot absolutely incredulous as perhaps even inthis more sceptical age there are many fewercomplete and absolute infidels on this particularthan give themselves out for such uncertainwhether he had not dreamed of these soundswhich seemed yet in his ears he was unwillingto risk the raillery of his friend by summoninghim to his assistance he sat up therefore inhis bed not without experiencing that nervousagitation to which brave men as well as cowards aresubject with this difference that the one sinksunder it like the vine under the hailstorm andthe other collects his energies to shake it off asthe cedar of lebanon is said to elevate its boughsto disperse the snow which accumulates uponthemthe story of harrison in his own absolutedespite and notwithstanding a secret

authorizeother visitations of a similar nature to warn toinstruct to punish rash are they was his conclusionand credulous who receive as truth everytale of the kind but no less rash may it be tolimit the power of the creator over the workswhich he has made and to suppose that by thepermission of the author of nature the laws ofnature may not in peculiar cases and for highpurposes be temporarily suspendedwhile these thoughts passed through everard'smind feelings unknown to him even whenhe stood first on the rough and perilous edge ofbattle gained ground upon him he feared heknew not what and where an open and discernibleperil would have drawn out his courage thewoods k absolute uncertainty of his situation increasedhis sense of the danger he felt an almost irresistibledesire to spring from his bed and heapfuel on the dying embers expecting by the blazeto see some strange sight in his chamber hewas also strongly templed to awaken wildrake but shame stronger than fear itself checkedthese impulses what should it be thoughtthat markham everard held one of the best soldierswho had drawn a sword in this sad war markham everard who had obtained such distinguishedrank in the army of the parliamentthough so young in years was afraid of remainingby himself in a twilightroom at midnightit never should be saidthis was however no charm for his unpleasantcurrent of thought there rushed on hismind the various traditions of victor lee's chamberwhich though he had often despised themas vague unauthenticated and inconsistent rumoursengendered by ancient superstition andtransmitted from generation to generation byloquacious rrcduhty had yet something in themwhich did not tend to allay the present imowoodstockpleasant state of his nerves then when herecollected the events of that very afternoonthe weapon pressed against his throat and thestrong arm which threw him backward on thefloor if the remembrance served to contradictthe idea of flitting phantoms and unreal daggersit certainly induced him to believe thatthere was in some part of this extensive mansiona party of cavaliers or malignant harbouredwho might arise in the night overpower theguards and execute upon them all but on harrisonin particular as one of the regicide judgesthat vengeance which was so eagerly thirsted forbythe attached followers of the slaughtered monarchhe endeavoured to console himself on thissubject by the number and position of theguards yet still was dissatisfied with himself fornot having taken yet more exact precautions andfor keeping an extorted promise of silence whichmight consign so many of his party to the dangerof assassination these thoughts connectedwith his military duties awakened another trainof reflections he bethought himself that all hewoodstock could now do was to visit the sentries and ascertainthat they were awake alert on the watchand so situated that in time of need they mightbe ready to support each other this betterbefits me he thought than to be here like achild frightening myself with the old woman'slegend which i have laughed at when a boywhat if old victor lee was a sacrilegious manas common report goes and brewed ale in thefont which he brought from the ancient palace ofholyrood while church and building were inflames and what if his eldest son was when achild scalded to death in the same vessel howmany churches have been demolished since histime how many fonts desecrated so manyindeed that were the vengeance of heaven tovisit such aggressions in a supernatural mannerno corner in england no not the most pettyparish church but would have its apparition tush these are idle fancies unworthy especiallyto be entertained by those educated to believethat sanctity resides in the intention and the actnot in the buildings or fonts or the form of worship woodstockas thus he called together the articles of hiscalvinistic creed the bell of the great clock atoken seldom silent in such narratives tolled threeand was immediately followed by the hoarse callof the sentinels through vault and gallery upstairsand beneath challenging and answeringeach other with the usual watchword all's welltheir voices mingled with the deep boom of thebell yet ceased before that was silent and whenthey had died away the tingling echo of the prolongedknell was scarcely audible ere yet thatlast distant tingling had finally subsided into silenceit seemed as if it again was awakened andeverard could hardly judge at first whether a newecho had taken up the falling cadence or whethersome other and separate sound was disturbinganew the silence to which the deep knell had asits voice ceased consigned the ancient mansionand the woods around itbut the doubt was soon cleared up the musicaltones which had mingled with the dyingechoes of the knell seemed at first to prolongand afterwards to survive them a wild strainof melody beginning at a distance and growwoodstocking louder as it advanced seemed to pass fromroom to room from cabinet to gallery fromhall to bower through the deserted and dishonouredruins of the ancient residence of so manysovereigns and as it approached no soldier gavealarm nor did any of the numerous guests of variousdegrees who spent an unpleasant and terrifiednight in that ancient mansion seem to dare toannounce to each other the inexplicable cause ofapprehensioneverard's excited state of mind did not permithim to be so passive the sounds approached sonigh that it seemed they were performing in thevery next apartment a solemn service for the deadwhen he gave the alarm by calling loudly to histrusty attendant and friend wildrake who slumberedin tht next chamber with only a door betwixtthem and even that ajarwildrake wildrake up up dost thounot hear the alarm there was no answer from wildrake thoughthe musical sounds which now rung through theapartment as if the performers had actually beenwithin its precincts would have been sufficient to woodstockawaken a sleeping person even without the shoutof his comrade and patronalarm roger wildrake arm again'called everard getting out of bed and graspinghisweapons get a light and cry alarmthere was no answer his voice died away asthe sound of the music seemed also to die andthe same soft sweet voice which still to his thinkingresembled that of alice lee was heard in hisapartment and as he thought at no distance fromhimyour comrade will not answer said the lowsoft voice those only hear the alarm whoseconsciences feel the callagain this mummery said edward iam better armed than i was of late and but forthe sound of that voice the speaker had boughthis trifling dearit was singular we may observe in passing thatthe instant the distinct sounds of the human voicewere heard by everard all idea of supernaturalinterference was at an end and the charm bywhich he had been formerly fettered appeared tobe broken so much is the influence of imaginarywoodblock or superstitious terror dependant so far as respectsstrong judgments at least upon what isvague or ambiguous and so readily do distincttones and express ideas bring such judgmentsback to the current of ordinary life the voice returnedanswer

afew barrels of gunpowder to make the mansion aheap of ruins and bury under them the authors ofsuch an illjudged pastimeyou speak proudly sir colonel said anothervoice similar to that harsher and strongertone by which he had been addressed in the gallery try your courage in this directionyou should not dare me twice said coloneleverard had i a glimpse of light to take aimbyas he spoke a sudden gleam of light wasthrown with a brilliancy which almost dazzledthe speaker showing distinctly a form somewhatresembling that of victor lee as representedin his picture holding in the one hand alady completely veiled and in the other his leadwoodstockkingstaff or truncheon both figures were animatedand as it appeared standing within sixfeet of himwere it not for the woman said everardi would not be thus mortally daredspare not for the female form but do yourworst replied the same voice i defy yourepeat your defiance when i have countedthrice said everard and take the punishmentof your

unwilling to shedblood i give you another chance of flight oncetwice thriceeverard aimed at the bosom and discharged hispistol the figure waved its arm in an attitude ofscorn and a loud laugh arose during which thelight as gradually growing weaker danced andglimmered upon the apparition of the aged knightand then disappeared everard's lifeblood rancold to his heart had he been of human mould woodstockie thought the bullet must have pierce himand i have neither will nor power to fight withsupernaturalal beingsthe feeling of oppression was now so strong asto be actually sickening he groped his wayhowever to the fireside and flung on the emberswhich were yet gleaming a handful of dry fuelit presently blazed and afforded him light to seetheroom in every direction he looked cautiouslyalmost timidly around and half expectedsome horrible phantom to become visible but hesaw nothing save the old furniture the and other articles which had been leftin the same state as when sir henry lee departedhe felt an uncontrollable desire mingledwith much repugnance to look at the portrait ofthe ancient knight which the form he had seenso strongly resembled he hesitated betwixt theopposing feelings but at length snatched with desperateresolution the taper which he had extinguishedand relighted it ere the blaze of the fuelhad again died away he held it up to the ancientportrait of victor lee and gazed on itwith eager curiosity not unmingled with fearwoodstock almost the childish terrors of his earlier days returnedand he thought the severe pale eye of theancient warrior followed his and menaced himwith its displeasure and although he quicklyargued himself out of such an absurd belief yetthe mixed feelings of his mind were expressed inwords that seemed half addressed to the ancientportraitsoul of my mother's ancestor he said beit for weal or for woe by designing men or bysupernatural beings that these ancient halls aredisturbed i am resolved to leave them on themorrowi rejoice to hear it with all my soul said avoice behind himhe turned saw a tall figure in white with asort of turban upon its head and dropping thecandle in the exertion

sir henry lee andhis family if they choose to resume it not thati am frightened into this as a concession to theseries of artifices which have been played off onthis occasion but solely because such was my intentionfrom the beginning but let me warn headded raising his voices let me warn the partiesconcerned in this combination that though itmay pass off successfully on a fool like lesbosa

sankgradually down on a large easy chair which hadbeen often pressed by the weight of stout sirhenry lee and in an instant was sound asleepeverard was far from feeling the same inclinationfor slumber yet his mind was relieved of the apprehensionof any farther visitation that night for he considered his treaty to evacuate woodswoodstockstock as made known to and accepted in all probabilityby those whom the intrusion of the commissionershad induced to take such singular measuresfor expelling them his opinion which hadfor a time bent towards a belief in something supernaturalin the disturbances had now returnedto the more rational mode of accounting for themby dexterous combination for which such a mansionas woodstock afforded so many facilitieshe heaped the hearth with fuel lighted thecandle and examining poor wildrake's situationadjusted him as easily in the chair as he could thecavalier stirring his limbs no more than an infanthis situation went far in his patron's opinion toinfer trick and confederacy for ghosts have no occasionto drug men's possets he threw himself onthe bed and while he thought these strange circumstancesover a sweet and low strain of music stolethrough the chamber the words good night good night good night thrice repeated eachtime in a softer and more distant tone seeming toassure him that the goblins and he were at truceif not at peace and that he had no more disturbanceto expect that night he had scarcely the couragewoodstock to call out a good night for after all his convictionof the existence of a trick it was so well performedas to bring with it a feeling of fear just likewhat an audience feel during the performance ofa tragic scene which they know to be unreal andwhich yet affects their passions by its near approachto nature

to churchyardmidsummer's nights drcatnwith the fresh air and the rising of morningevery feeling of the preceding night had passedaway from colonel everard's mind excepting wonderhow the effects which he had witnessed could beproduced he examined the whole room soundingbolt floor and wainscot with his knucklesand cane but was unable to discern any secretpassages while the door secured by a strong crossbolt and the lock besides remained as firm as whenhe had fastened it on the preceding evening theapparition resembling victor lee next called hisattention ridiculous stories had been often cirwoodstock related of this figure or one exactly resemblingit having been met with by night among thewaste apartments and corridors of the old palace and markham everard had often heard such inhis childhood he was angry to recollect his owndeficiency of courage and the thrill which he felton the preceding night when by confederacydoubtless such an object was placed before hiseyessurely he said this fit of childish follycould not make me miss my aim more likelythat the bullet had been withdrawn clandestinelyfrom my pistolhe examined that which was undischarged hefound the bullet in it he investigated the apartmentopposite to the point at which he had firedand at five feet from the door in a direct line betweenthe bedside and the place where the appearanceshad been seen a pistolball had recentlyburied itself in the wainscot he had little doubttherefore that he had fired in a just direction and indeed to have arrived at the place where itwas lodged the bullet must have passed through woodstockthe appearance at which he aimed and proceededpoint blank to the wall beyond this was mysteriousand induced him to doubt whether the art ofwitchcraft or conjuration had not been called in toassist the machinations of those daring conspiratorswho being themselves mortal might neverthelessaccording to the universal creed of thetimes have invoked and obtained assistance fromthe inhabitants of another worldhis next investigation respected the picture ofvictor lee itself he examined it minutely as hestood on the floor before it and compared its paleshadowy faintlytraced outlines its faded coloursthe stern repose of the eye and deathlike pallidnessof the countenance with its different aspect onthe preceding night when illuminated by the artificiallight which fell full upon it while it leftevery other part of the room in comparative darknessthe features seemed then to have an unnaturalglow while the rising and falling of the flame inthe chimney gave the head and limbs somethingwhich resembled the appearance of actual motionnow seen by day it was a mere picture of thewoodstock hard and ancient school of holbein formerly itseemed for the moment something more determinedto get to the bottom of this contrivance ifpossible everard by the assistance of a table andchair examined the portrait still more closely andendeavoured to ascertain the existence of any privatespring by which it might be slipt aside acontrivance not unfrequent in ancient buildingswhich usually abounded with means of access andescape communicated to none but the lords of thecastle or their immediate confidents but thepanel on which victor lee was painted wasfirmly fixed in the wainscoting of the apartmentof which it made a part and the colonel satisfiedhimself that it could not hav been used for thepurpose which he had suspectedhe next aroused his faithful squire wildrakewho notwithstanding his deep share of the blessednessof sleep had scarce even yet got rid ofthe effects of the gracecup of the preceding evening it was the reward according to his ownview of the matter of his temperance onesingle draught having made him sleep more lateand more sound than a matter of halfadozen or woodstockfrom thence to a dozen pulls would have donewhen he was guilty of the enormity of reresuppers and of drinking deep after themhad your temperate draught said everard been but a thought more strongly seasonedwildrake thou hadst slept so sound that the lasttrump only could have waked theeand then answered wildrake i shouldhave waked with a headache mark for i see mymodest sip has not exempted me from that epilogue but let us go forth and see how the nightwhich we have passed so strangely has been spentby the rest of them i suspect they are all rightwilling to evacuate woodstock unless they havecither rested better than we or at least been morelucky in lodgingsin that case i will dispatch thee down tojoceline's hut to negotiate the reentrance of shweresuppers quasi

fiends arc all of your own political woodstockpersuasion wildrake all trueblue cavaliers andi am convinced that sir henry and alice leethough they be unconnected with them have notthe slightest cause

rushed on my mind said thedivine that the stoical philosopher athenodoruswoodstock had eluded the horrors of such a vision by patientlypursuing his studies and it shot at the sametime across my mind

which he had sufferedto escape him in his impatience everard hastenwoodstocked to apologize and to offer every conciliatoryexcuse however inconsistent which occurred tohim on the moment but the old

colonel friend answered the old man starting up we are foes sir foes now and for ever so saying and starting from the seat into whichhe had rather fallen than thrown himself he ranout of the room with a precipitation of step whichhe was apt to use upon occasions of irritablefeeling and which was certainly more eager thandignified especially as he muttered while he ranand seemed as if he were keeping up his ownpassion by recounting over and over the offencewhich he had receivedsoh said colonel everard and there woodstockwas not strife enough between mine uncle and thepeople of woodstock already but i must needsincrease it by chafing this irritable and quicktemperedold man eager as i knew him to be inhis ideas of church government and stiff in hisprejudices respecting all who dissent from him the mob of woodstock will rise for thoughhe would not get a score of them to stand by himin any honest or intelligible purpose yet let himcry havoc and destruction and i will warrant hehas followers enow and my uncle is equally wildand unpersuadable for the value of all the estatehe ever had he would not allow a score of troopersto be quartered in the house for defence andif he be alone or has but joceline to stand byhim he will be as sure to fire upon those whocome to attack the lodge as if he had a hundredmen in garrison and then what can chance butdanger and bloodshed this progress of melancholy anticipation wasinterrupted by the return of master holdenoughwho hurrying into the room with the same precipitatepace at which he had left it ran straightup to the colonel and said take my handwoodstock markham take my hand hastily for the oldadam is whispering at my heart that it is a disgraceto hold it extended so long most heartily do i receive your hand myvenerable

good master holdenough saidcolonel everard it was a hasty word i meantnot in serious earnest to upbraidpeace i pray you peace said the divine i say the allusion to that which you have nostjustly

like to finish our october thanwoodstock our october is to finish him said the keeper and withdrew under the encouraging smile of hispatronhe whistled bevis along with him to share inhis watch and having received exact informationwhere the clergyman was most likely to befound assured his master that he would give themost pointed attention to his safety when theattendants had withdrawn having previously removedthe remains of the meal the old knightleaning back in his chair encouraged pleasantvisions than had of late passed through his imaginationuntil by degrees he was surprised byactual slumber while his daughter not venturingto move but on tiptoe took some needleworkand bringing it close by the old mates sideemployed her fingers on this task bending her eyesfrom time to time on her parent with the affectionatezeal if not the effective power of a guardianangel at length as the light faded away andnight came on she wa about to cause candles tobe brought but remembering how indifferent couch jocelines cottage had afforded she couldiot think of interrupting the first sound and re woodstockpressing sleep which her father had enjoyed inall probability for the last two nights and daysshe herself had no other amusement as shesat facing one of the great oriel windows thesame by which wildrake had on a former occasionlooked in upon tomkins and joceline whileat their computations than watching the cloudswhich a lazy wind sometimes chased from thebroad disk of the harvestmoon sometimes permittedto accumulate and exclude her brightnessthere is i know not why something peculiarlypleasing to the imagination in contemplatingthe queen of night when she is wadingas the expression is among the vapours which shehas not power to dispel and which on their sideare unable entirely to quench her lustre it is thestriking image of patient virtue calmly pursuingher path through good report and bad reporthaving that excellence in herself which ought tocommand all admiration but bedimmed in theeyes of the world by suffering by misfortune bycalumnyas some such reflections perhaps were passingthrough alice's imagination she became senwoodstockbible to her surprise and alarm that some onehad clambered up upon the window and waslooking into the room the idea of supernaturalfear did not in the slightest degree agitate aliceshe was too much accustomed to the place andsituation for folks do not see spectres in thescenes with which they have been familiar from infancybut danger from marauders in a disturbedcountry was a more formidable subject of apprehensionand the thought armed alice who wasnaturally highspirited with such desperate couragethat she snatched a pistol from the wallonwhich some firearms hung and while shescreamed to her father to awake had the presenceof mind to present it at the intruder she didso the more readily because she imagined sherecognized in the visage which she partially sawthe features of the woman whom she had metwith at rosamond's well and which had appearedto her peculiarly harsh and suspicious herfather at the same time seized his sword and cameforward while the person at the window alarmedat these demonstrations and endeavouring todescend missed footing as had cavahero wiltswoodstockdrake before her and went down to the earthwith no small noise nor was the reception onthe bosom of our common mother either soft orsafe for by a most terrific bark and growl theyheard that bevis had come up and seized on theparty ere he or she could gain their feethold fast but worry not said the oldknight alice thou art the queen of wenches stand fast here till i run down and secure therascalfor god's sake no my dearest father alice exclaimed joceline will be up immediately hark i hear himthere was indeed a bustle below and morethan one light danced to and fro in confusionwhile those who bore them called to each otheryet suppressing their voices as they spoke asmen who would only be heard by those they addressedthe individual who had fallen underthe power of bevis was most impatient in his situationand called with least precaution herelee forester take the dog off else i mustshoot him if thou dost said sir henry from the winwoodstock dow i blow thy brains out on the spot thievesjocehne thieves come up and secure this ruffian bevis hold on back bevis down sir cried joceline i am coming i am coming sir henry saintmichael i shall go distracted a terrible thought suddenly occurred to alicecould joceline have become unfaithful thathe was calling bevis off the villain instead of encouragingthe trusty dog to secure him herfather meantime moved perhaps by some suspicionof the same kind hastily stepped aside outof the moonlight and pulled alice close to himso as to be invisible from without yet so placedas to hear what should pass the scuffle betweenbevis and his prisoner seemed to be ended byjocelines interference and there was close whisperingfor an instant as of people in consultation all is quiet now said one voice i willup and prepare the way for you and immediatelya form presented itself on the outsideof the window pushed open the lattice andsprung into the parlour but almost ere his stepwas upon the floor certainly before he had pb woodstockgained any secure footing the old knight whostood ready with his rapier drawn made a desperatepass which bore the intruder to the groundeocene who clambered up next with a darklantern in his hand uttered a dreadful exclamationwhen he saw what had happened cryingout lord in heaven he has slain his own son no no i tell you no said the fallen youngman who was indeed young albert lee the onlyson of the old knight i am not hurt nonoise on your lives get lights instantly atthe same time he started from the floor as quicklyas he could under the embarrassment of a cloakand doublet skewered as it were together by therapier of the old knight whose pass most fortunatelyhad been diverted from the body ofalbert by the interruption of his cloak the bladepassing right across his back piercing the clotheswhile the hilt coming against his side with thewhole force of the lounge had borne him to thegroundjoceline all the while enjoined silence to everyoneunder the strictest conjurations silenceas you would live long on earth silence as youwoodstock would have a place in heaven be but silent forafew minutes all our

read the prayers at joceline's hut nowcame forward get water he said instantlyand the helpful hand and light foot of woodstockalice with the readywitted tenderness whichnever stagnates in vain lamentations while thereis any room for hope provided with incrediblecelerity all that the clergyman called forit is but a swoon he said on feeling sirhenry's palm a swoon produced from theinstant and unexpected shock rouse thee upalbert i promise thee it will be nothing save asyncope a cup my dearest alice and a ribbonor a bandage i must take some blood some aromatics too if they can be had my

no sign of comfort stood withboth hands clasped and elevated into the air amonument of speechless despair every featurein his face seemed to express the thought herelies my father's corpse and it is i whose rashnesshas slain him but when a few drops of blood began to followthe lancet at first falling singly and thenwoodstock trickling in a freer stream when in consequenceof the application of cold water to the templesand aromatics to the nostrils the old man sighedfeebly and made an effort to move his limbsalbert lee changed his posture at once to throwhimself at the feet of the clergyman and

killed i never madea fairer stramaon in my life the shell of myrapier struck against his ribs so dead he mustbe or my right hand has forgot its cunning nobody was slain said the doctor wemust thank god for that since there were nonebut friends to slay here is a good cloak and doubletthough wounded in a fashion which will requiresome skill in tailorcraft to cure but i wasyour last antagonist and took a little blood fromyou merely to prepare you for the pleasure andsurprise of seeing your son who though huntedpretty close as you may believe hath made hisway from worcester hither wherewith

dear son said the knightshall i not then instantly see him and whereforedid you not forewarn me of this joyfulevent because i was uncertain of his motionssaid the doctor and rather thought he wasbound for the seaside and that it would be bestto tell you of his fate when he was safe on boardand in full sail for france we had appointedto let you know all when i came hither tonightto join you but there is a redcoat in the housewhom we care not to trust farther than we couldnot help we dared not therefore venture in bythe hall and so prowling round the buildingalbert informed us that an old prank of hiswhen a boy consisted of entering by this wuiwoodstock dow a lad who was with us would needs makethe experiment as there seemed to be no light inthe chamber and the moonlight without made usliable to be detected his foot slipped and ourfriend bevis came upon usin good truth you acted simply said sirhenry to attack a garrison without a summonsbut all this is nothing to my son albert whereis he let me see himbut sir henry wait said the doctor tillyour restored strength a plague of my restored strength man answered the knight as his old spirit began toawaken within him dost not remember thati lay on edgehillfield all night bleeding like abullock from five several wounds and wore myarmour within six weeks and you talk to me ofthe few drops of blood that follow such a scratchas a cat's claw might have made nay if you feel so courageous said thedoctor i will fetch your son he is not far distantso saying he left the apartment making a signto alice to remain in case any symptoms of herfather's weakness should returnvol ii n woodstockit was fortunate perhaps that sir henry neverseemed to recollect the precise nature of thealarm which had at once and effectually as theshock of the thunderbolt for the moment suspendedhis faculties something he said morethan once of being certain he had done mischiefwith that stramafon as he called it but his minddid not recur to that danger as having been incurredby his son alice glad to see that herfather appeared to have forgotten a circumstanceso fearful as men often forget the blow or othersudden cause which has thrown

with many thanks and words of comfortto us in general and some kind expressionsto most of us in especial he sent his royal greetingto you sir in particular and said more thanbecomes me to repeatnay i

deathbed pleadingfor the safety of an only sonwoodstock thou hadst deserved an halter hadst thouhesitated said sir henry the smallest treecan always give some shelter and it pleases meto think the old

like it noti have small cause albert answered theknight small cause who stirred up thesedisunion the scots who strengthened thehands of parliament when their cause was wellnigh ruined the scots again who deliveredup the king their countryman who had flunghimself upon their protection the scots againbut this lad's father you say has fought on thepart of the noble montrose and such a man asthe great marquis may make amends for the degeneracyof a whole nation woodstockinay father said albert and i must addthat though this lad is uncouth and waywardand as you will see something wilful yet theking has not a more zealous friend in england and when occasion offered he fought stoutly tooin his defence i marvel he comes nothe hath taken the bath said joceline andnothing less would serve than that he should haveit immediately the supper he said might be gotready in the meantime and he commands allabout him as if he were in his father's old castlewhere he might have called long enough i

seated himself without muchceremony at the lower end of the tablehe was a tall rawboned lad with a shockhead of hair fiery red like many of his countrywhile the harshness of his national features wasincreased by the contrast of his complexion turnedalmost black by the exposure to all sorts ofweather which in that skulking and ramblingmode of life the fugitive royalists had been obligedto

the eyes were brilliantand expressive and amid his ugliness for itamounted to that degree of irregularity the facevas not deficient in some lines which expressedboth sagacity and resolutionthe dress of albert himself was far beneath hisquality as the son of sir henry lee and commanderof a regiment in the royal service butthat of his page was still more dilapidated adisastrous green jerkin which had been changedto a hundred hues by sun and rain so that theoriginal could scarce be discovered huge clouterlyshoes leathern breeches such as were worn byhedgers coarse grey worsted stockings were

betrayingany symptoms of the bread and butter withwhich he had attempted to close the orifice of hisstomach his appetite appeared to have been sharpenedby a nine days fast and the knight wasdisposed

like others of his time heldthe reins of discipline rather tight over the risinggeneration at least to judge from the youthsof scotland whom i have seen at his late majesty'scourt in former days they

selfintroduction of master draketo which the knight replied by asking him tosit down and take a glass of sack to his majesty'sglorious restoration wildrake at this hint squeezedin without ceremony beside the young scotchmanand not only pledged his landlord's toastbut seconded its import by volunteering a verseor two of his favourite loyal ditty the kingshall enjoy his own again the heartiness whichhe threw into his song opened still farther theheart of the old knight though albert and alicelooked at each other with looks resentful of theintrusion and desirous to put an end to it thehonourable master kerneguy either possessed thathappy indifference of temper which does not deignto notice such circumstances or he was able toassume the appearance of it to perfection as hesat

altogetherclear and distinguishablewoodstock it was a remarkable part of what is culled bytheatrical folks the byplay of this scene thatalbert was conversing apart with doctor rochecliffsin whispers even more than the divine seemeddesirous of encouraging yet to whatever theirprivate conversation referred it did not deprivethe young colonel from the power of listening towhat was going forward in the party at large andinterfering from time to time like a watchdogwho can distinguish the slightest alarm even whenemployed in the engrossing process of taking hisfoodcaptain wildrake said albert we haveno objection i mean my friend and i to becommunicative on proper occasions but you sirwho are so old a sufferer must needs know thatat such casual meetings as this men do not mentiontheir names

ofwoodstock meat and so forth when these cockneypikes ofthe artillery ground as you very well call themrallied and came in with their armed heads asboldly as so many cotswold rams i sprang downstairs

cockney chargedup to my bonny bay poor lass to rescue littlecakebread they only cried haro and out uponmealas alas said the knight we madeourselves seem worse than we were and we weretoo bad to deserve god's blessing even in a goodcause but it is needless to look back we didnot deserve victories when god gave them forwe never improved them like good soldiers orlike christian men and so we gave these cantingscoundrels the advantage of us for they assumedout of mere hypocrisy the discipline and orderly woodstockbehaviour which we who drew our swords in abetter cause ought to have practised out of trueprinciple but here is my hand captain i haveoften wished to see the honest fellow who chargedup so smartly in our behalf and i reverence youfor the care you took of the poor child

iialbert and his page were ushered by joceline to what was called the spanish chambera huge old scrambling bedroom rather in a dilapidatedcondition but furnished with a largestanding bed for the master and a trucklebedfor the domestic as was common at a much laterperiod in old english houses where the gentlemanoften required the assistance of a groom ofthe chambers to help him to bed if the hospitalityhad been exuberant the walls were coveredwith hangings of cordovan leather stampedwith gold and representing fights between the woodstockspaniards and moriscoes bullfeasts and othersports peculiar to the peninsula from which ittook its name of the spanish chamber thesehangings were in some places entirely torn downin others defaced and hanging in tatters butalbert stopped not to make observations anxiousit seemed to get joceline out of the room whichhe achieved by hastily answering his offers of freshfuel and more liquor in the negative and returningwith equal conciseness the underkeeper'sgood wishes for the evening he at length retiredsomewhat unwillingly and as if he thoughtthat his young master might have bestowed a fewmore words upon a faithful old retainer after solong absencejoliffe was no sooner gone than before a singleword was spoken between albert lee and hispage the former hastened to the door examinedlock latch and bolt and made them fast with themost scrupulous attention he superadded tothese precautions that of a long screwbolt whichhe brought out of his pocket and which he screwedon to the staple in such a manner as to renderit impossible to withdraw it or open the door unwoodstocksaplessby breaking it down the page held alight tohim during the operation which his master wentthrough with much exactness and dexterity butwhen albert arose from his knee on which he hadrested during the accomplishment of this task themanner of the companions was on the sudden entirelychanged towards each other the honourablemaster kerneguy from a cubbish lout of araw scotsman seemed to have acquired at onceall the grace and ease of motion and mannerwhich could be given by an acquaintance of theearliest and most familiar kind with the best companyof the timehe gave the light he held to albert with theeasy indifference of a superior who rather gracesthan troubles his dependent by giving him someslight service to perform albert with the greatestappearance of deference assumed in his turnthe character of torchbearer and lighted his pageacross the chamber without turning his back uponhim as he did so he then set the light on a tableby the bedside and approaching the young manwith deep reverence received from him the soiledgreen jacket with the same profound respect as woodstockif he had been a first lord of the bedchamberor other officer of the household of the highestdistinction disrobing his sovereign of the mantleof the garter the person to whom this ceremonywas addressed endured it for a minute ortwo with profound gravity and then bursting outalaughing exclaimed to albert what a devilmeans all this formality thou complimentswith these miserable rags as if they were silksand sables and with poor louis kerneguy as ifhe were the king of great britain and if your majesty's commands and thecircumstances of the time have made me for a momentseem to forget that you are my sovereignsurely i may be permitted to render my homageas such while you are in your own royal palace ofwoodstocktruly replied the disguised monarch thesovereign and the palace are not ill matched these tattered hangings and my ragged jerkin suiteach other admirably this woodstock thisthe bower where the royal norman revelled withthe fair rosamond clifford why it is a placecf assignation for owls then suddenly recollectwoodstocking himself with his natural courtesy he addedas if fearing he might have hurt albert's feelingsbut the more obscure and retired it is thefitter for our purpose lee and if it does seem tobe a roost for owls as there is no denying whywe know it has nevertheless brought up eagleshe threw himself as he spoke upon a chair andindolently but gracefully received the kind officesof albert who undid the coarse buttoning of hisleathern gashes which defended his legs andspoke to him the whilst what a fine specimenof the olden time is your father sir henry it isstrange i should not have seen him before buti heard my father often speak of him as beingamong the flower of our real old english gentryby the mode in which he began to school me ican guess you had a tight taskmaster of him albert i warrant you never wore hat in his presenceeh i never cocked it at least in his presenceplease your majesty as i have seen some youngstersdo answered albert indeed if i had itmust have been a stout beaver to have saved mefrom a broken headwoodstockoh i doubt it not replied the king afine old gentleman but with that methinks in hiscountenance that assures you he would not hatethe child in sparing the rod hark ye albert suppose the same glorious restoration comeround which if drinking to its arrival can hastenit should not be far distant for in that particularour adherents never neglect their duty supposeit come therefore and that thy father asmust be of course becomes an earl and one ofthe privy council odd's fish man i shall be asmuch afraid of him as ever was my grandfatherhenri quatre of old sully imagine there weresuch a trinket now about the court as the fairrosamond or la belle gabrielle what a workthere would be of pages and grooms of the chamto get the pretty rogue clandestinely shuffledout by the backstairs like a prohibited commoditywhen the step of the earl of woodstock washeard in the antechamber vi am glad to see your majesty so merry afteryour fatiguing journeythe fatigue was nothing man said charlesa kind welcome and a good meal made amendswoodstock for all that but they must have suspected thee ofbringing a wolf from the braes of badcnoch alongwith you instead of a twolegged being with nomore than the usual allowance of mortal stowagefor provisions i was really ashamed of my appetite but thou knowest i had eat nothing fortwentyfour hours save the raw egg you stole formefrom the old woman's henroost i tell thee iblushed to show myself so ravenous before thathigh bred and respectable old gentleman yourfather and the very pretty girl your sister orcousin is she she is my sister said albert lee drily andadded in the same breath your majesty's appetitesuited well enough with the character of araw northern lad would your majesty nowplease to retire to rest not for a minute or two said the king retaininghis seat why man i have scarce hadmy tongue unchained today and to talk withthat northern twang and besides the fatigue ofbeing obliged to speak every word in character gad it's like walking as the galley slaves do onthe continent with a twentyfourpound shotg woodstockchained to their legs they may drag it alongbut they cannot move with comfort and by theway thou art slack in paying me my welldeservedtribute of compliments on my counterfeitingdid i not play louis kerneguy as round as aring if your majesty asks my serious opinion perhapsi may be forgiven if i say your dialect wassomewhat too coarse for a scottish youth of highbirth and your behaviour perhaps a little toochurlish i thought too though i pretend notto be skilful that some of your scotch soundedas if it were not genuinelynot genuine there is no pleasing thee albert why who should speak genuine scotchbut myself was i not their king for a matterof ten months and if i did not get knowledgeof their language i wonder what else i got byit did not east country and south country andwest country and highlands caw croak andshriek about me as the deep guttural the broaddrawl and the high sharp yelp predominated byturns odd's fish man have i not been speecheswoodstock jat by their orators addressed by their senators rebukedby their workmen have i not sate on thecuttlestool mon again assuming the northerndialect and thought it grace of worthy mas johngillespie that i was permitted to do penance inmine own privy chamber instead of the face of thecongregation and wilt thou tell me after all thati cannot speak scotch enough to bare an oxonknight and his family may it please your majesty i began bysaying i was no judge of the scottish languagepshaw it is mere envy just so you said atnorton's that i was too courteous and civil for ayoung page now you think me too rude and there is a medium if one could find itsaid albert defending his opinion in the sametone in which the king attacked him so thismorning when you were in the woman's dress youraised your petticoats rather unbecomingly highas you waded through the first little stream andwhen i told you of it to mend the matter youdraggled through the next without raising themat allo the devil take the woman's dress said woodstockcharles i hope i shall never be driven to thatdisguise again why my ugly face was enoughto put gowns caps and kirtles out of fashion forever the very dogs fled from me had i passedany hamlet that had but five huts in it i couldnot have escaped the cuckingstool i was a libelon womanhood these leathern conveniences arenone of the gayest but they are propria que marius and right glad am i to be repossessed ofthem i can tell you too my friend i shall resumeall my masculine privileges with my properhabiliments and as you say i have been toocoarse tonight i will behave myself like a courtierto mistress alice tomorrow i made a sortof acquaintance with her already when i seemedto be of the same sex with herself and found outthere are other colonels in the wind besides youcolonel albert leemay it please your majesty said albert and then stopped short from the difficulty offinding words to express the unpleasant nature ofhis feelings they could not escape charles buthe proceeded without scruple i pique myselfon seeing as far into the hearts of young ladieswoodstock as most folks though god knows they are sometimestoo deep for the wisest of us but i mentionedto your sister in my character of fortuneteller thinking poor simple man that a country girl musthave no one but her brother to dream about that she was anxious about a certain colonel ihad hit the theme but not the person for i alludedto you albert and i presume the blushwas too deep ever to be given to a brother so upshe got and away she flew from me like a lapwingi can excuse her for looking at myself in the welli think if i had met such a creature as i seemedi should have called fire and faggot against it now what think you albert who can this colonelbe that more than rivals you in your sister'saffection albert who well knew that the king's mode ofthinking where the fair sex was concerned wasfar more gay than delicate endeavoured to put astop to the present topic by a grave answerhis sister he said had been in some measureeducated with the son of her maternal unclemarkham everard but as his father and he himselfhad adopted the cause of the roundheads the woodstockfamilies had in consequence been at variance andany projects which might have been formerly entertainedwere of course long since dismissed onall sides'you are wrong albert you are wrong saidthe king pitilessly pursuing his jest you colonelswhether you wear blue or orange sashesare too pretty fellows to be dismissed so easilywhen once you have acquired an interest butmistress alice so pretty and who wishes the restorationof the king with such a look and accentas if she were an angel whose prayers mustneeds bring it down must not be allowed to retainany thoughts of a canting roundhead whatsay you will you give me leave to take her totask about it after all i am the party mostconcerned in maintaining true allegiance amongtiny subjects and if i gain the pretty maidens'good will that of the sweethearts will soon followthis was jolly king edward's way edward thefourth you know the kingmaking earl of warwick the cromwell of his day dethroned himmore than once but he had the hearts of thehiwoodstock hmerry dames of london and the purses and veinsof the cockneys bled freely till they brought himhome again how say you shall i shake off mynorthern slough and speak with alice in my owncharacter showing what education and mannershave done for me to make the best amends theycan for an ugly face may it please your majesty said albert inan altered and embarrassed tone i did not expecthere he stopped not able to find words adequateat the same time to express his sentimentsand respectful enough to the king while in thisfather's house and under his own protectionand what is it that master lee does not expect said charles with marked gravity on hispartagain albert attempted a reply but advancedno farther than i would hope if it please yourmajesty when he again stopped short his deepand hereditary respect for his sovereign and hissense of the hospitality due to his misfortunespreventing his giving utterance to this irritatedfeelingsvol ii q woodstockand what does colonel albert lee hope said charles in the same dry and cold manner inwhich he had before spoken no answer now hope that colonel lee does not see in asilly jest anything offensive to the honour of hisfamily since methinks that were an indifferentcompliment to his sister his father and himselfnot to mention charles stuart whom he calls hisking and expect that i shall not be so hardlyconstrued as to be supposed capable of forgettingthat mistress auce lee is the daughter of myfaithful subject and host and the sister of myguide and preserver come come albert headded changing at once to his naturally frank andunceremonious manner you forget how long ihave been abroad where men women and childrentalk gallantry morning noon and nightwith no more serious thought than just to passaway the time and i forget too that you are ofthe oldfashioned english school a son after sirhenry's own heart and don't understand railleryupon such subjects but i ask your pardonalbert sincerely if i have really hurt youso saying he extended his hand to colonel leewoodstock siiwho feeling he had been really too hasty in construingthe king's jest in an unpleasant sense kissedit with reverence and attempted an apologynot a word not a word said the goodnaturedprince raising his penitent adherent as heattempted to kneel we understand each otheryou are somewhat afraid of the gay reputationwhich i acquired in scotland but i assure you iwill be as stupid as you or your cousin colonelcould desire in presence of mrs alice lee andonly bestow my gallantry should i have any tothrow away upon the pretty little waitingmaidwho attended at supper unless you should havemonopolized her ear for your own benefit colonelalbertit is monopolized sure enough though not byme if it please your majesty but by joceline underkeeper whom we must not disobligeas we have trusted him so far already and mayhave occasion to repose even entire confidence inhim i half think he suspects who louis kernmay in reality beyou are an engrossing set you wooers ofwoodstock said the king laughing now woodstockif i had a fancy as a frenchman would not failto have in such a case to make pretty speechesto the deaf old woman i saw in the kitchen as apisaller i dare say i should be told that tier earwas engrossed for dr rochecliffe's sole use i marvel at your majesty's good spiritssaid albert that after a day of danger fatigueand accidents you should feel the power of amusingyourself thusthat is to say the groom of the chamberswishes his majesty would go to sleep well oneword or two on more serious business and i havedone i have been completely directed by youand rochecliffe i have changed my disguisefrom female to male upon the instant and alteredmy destination from hampshire to take shelterhere do you still hold it the wiser course i have great confidence in dr rochecliffereplied albert whose acquaintance with thescattered royalists enables him to gain the mostaccurate intelligence his pride in the extent ofhis correspondence and the complication of hisplots and schemes for your majesty's service is indeedthe very food he lives upon but his sagacitywoodstock is equal to this vanity i repose besides the utmostfaith in joiiffe of my father and sister iwould say nothing yet i would not without reasonextend the knowledge of your majesty's personfarther than it is indispensably necessaryis it handsome in me said charles pausingto withhold my full confidence from sir henrylee ryour majesty heard of his almost deathswoonof last night what would agitate him mostdeeply must noi be hastily communicatedtrue but are we safe from a visit of theredcoats they have them in woodstock as wellas in oxford said charlesdr rochecliffe says not unwisely answeredlee that it is best sitting near the fire when thechimney smokes and that woodstock so lately inpossession of the sequestrated and in the vicinityof the soldiers will be less suspected and morecarelessly searched than more distant cornerswhich might seem to promise more safety besideshe added rochecliffe is in possession ofcurious and important news concerning the stateof matters at woodstock highly favourable to yourwoodstockmajesty's being concealed in the palace for two orthree days till shipping is provided the parliamentor usurping council of state had sentdown sequestrated whom their own evil consciencesassisted perhaps by the tricks of some daringcavaliers had frightened out of the lodge withoutmuch desire to come back again then themore formidable usurper cromwell had granteda warrant of possession to colonel everard whohad only used it for the purpose of repossessinghis uncle in the

folkscannot judge rightly where sisters are concernedthey are too familiar with the magnet to judgeof its powers of attraction everard will be hereas if drawn by cartropes fetters not to talk ofpromises will not hold him and then methinkswe are in some dangeri hope not said albert in the firstplace i know markham is a slave to his word besideswere any chance to bring him here i thinki could pass your majesty upon him without difficultyas louis kerneguy then although mycousin and i have not been at one for these someyears i believe him incapable of betraying yourmajesty and lastly if i saw the least danger ofit i would were he ten times my mother's nephewrun my sword through his body ere hehad time to execute his purposethere is but another question said charlesand i will release you albert you seem to woodstockthink yourself secure from search it may be so but in any other country this tale of goblinswhich is flying about would bring down priestsand ministers of justice to examine the reality ofthe stormy and mobs of idle people to satisfy theircuriosity respecting the first sir we hope and understandthat colonel everard's influence will preventany immediate inquiry for the sake of preservingundisturbed the peace of his uncle's family and as for any one coming without some sortof authority the whole neighbours have muchlove and fear of my father and are besides sohorribly alarmed about the goblins of woodstockthat fear will silence curiosityon the whole then said charles thechances of safety seem to be in favour of the planwe have adopted which is all i can hope for in acondition where absolute safety is out of the questionthe bishop recommended dr rochechffe asone of the most ingenious boldest and most loyalsons of the church of england you albert leehave marked your fidelity by a hundred proofsto you and your local knowledge i submit mywoodstockself and now prepare our arms alive i willnot be taken yet i will not believe that a sonof the king of england and heir of her thronecould be destined to danger in his own palaceand under the guard of the loyal leesalbert lee laid pistols and swords in readinessby the king's bed and his own

little noise as was possible thewoodstock slumbers of the haunted prince were easily disturbedhe started up in his bed and asked ifthere was any alarmnone please your majesty replied lee only thinking on the questions your majestywas asking last night and the various chancesthere are of your majesty's safety being endangeredfrom unforeseen accidents i thought ofgoing thus early both to communicate with doctorrochecliffe and to keep such a lookout asbefits the place where are lodged for the time thefortunes of england i fear i must request ofyour majesty for your own gracious securitythat you have the goodness to condescend to securethe door with your own hand after i go outoh talk not to majesty for heaven's sakedear albert answered the poor king endeavouringin vain to put a part of his clothes in orderto traverse the room when a king's doubletand hose are so ragged that he can no more findhis way into them than he could have travelledthrough the forest of deane without a guide goodfaith there should be an end of majesty until itchances to be better accommodated besides there woodstockis the chance of these big words bolting out atunawares when there are ears to hear them whomwe might think dangerousyour commands shall be obeyed said leewho had now succeeded in opening the door fromwhich he took his departure leaving the kingwho had hustled along the floor for that purposewith his dress woefully ill arranged to make it fastagain behind him and begging his majesty in nocase to open to any one unless he or rochecliffewere of the party who summoned himalbert then set out in quest of doctor sapartment which was only known to himselfand the faithfuljoliffe and had at different timesaccommodated that steady churchman with a placeof concealment when from his bold and busy temperwhich led him into the most extensive andhazardous machinations on the king's behalf hehad been strictly sought after by the opposite partyof late the inquest after him had died entirelyaway as he had prudently withdrawn himselffrom the scene of his intrigues since the loss ofthe battle of worcester he had been afloat againand more active than ever and had by friendswoodstock and correspondents and especially the bishop ofbeen the means of directing the king's flighttowards woodstock although it was not until thevery day of his arrival that he could promise hima safe reception at that ancient mansionalbert lee though he revered both the undauntedspirit and ready resources of the bustlingand undertaking churchman felt he had not beenenabled by him to answer some of the king's questionsyesternight in a way so distinct as one trustedwith the king's safety ought to have done andit was now his object to make himself personallyacquainted if possible with the various bearingsof so weighty a matter as became a man on whom so much of the responsibility wa likely to descendeven his local knowledge was scarce adequateto find the doctor's secret apartment had he nottraced his way after a genial flavour of roastedgame through divers blind passages and up anddown certain very useless stairs through cupboardsand hatchways and so forth to a speciesof sanctum sanatorium where joceline joliffewas ministering to the good doctor a solemnbreakfast of wildfowl with a cup of small beer woodstockstirred with a sprig of rosemary which doctorrochecliffe preferred to all strong potations besidehim sat bevis on his tail slobbering and lookingamiable moved by the rare smell of the breakfastwhich had quite overcome his native dignityof dispositionthe chamber in which the doctor had establishedhimself was a little octangular room with wallsof great thickness within which were fabricatedvarious issues leading in different directions andcommunicating with different parts of the buildingaround him were packages with arms and nearhim one small barrel as it seemed of gunpowder many papers in different parcels and severalkeys for correspondence in cypher two or threescrolls covered with hieroglyphics were also besidehim which albert took for plans of nativity andvarious models of machinery in which doctorrochecliffe was an adept there were also toolsof various kinds masks cloaks and a dark lanternand a number of other indescribable trinketsbelonging to the trade of a daring plotterin dangerous times last there was a casketwith gold and silver coin of different countrieswoodstock which was left carelessly open as if it were theleast of doctor rochecliffes concern althoughhis habits in general announced narrow circumstancesif not actual poverty close by the divine'splate lay a bible and prayerbook with someproof sheets as they are technically called seeminglyfresh from the press there was also withinthe reach of his hand a dirk or scottish poniarda powderhorn and a musketoon or blunderbusswith a pair of handsome pocketpistols in themidst of this miscellaneous collection the doctorsat eating his breakfast with great appetite aslittle dismayed by the various implements of dangeraround him as a workman is when accustomedto the perils of a gunpowder manufactorysoh young gentleman he said getting upand extending his hand are you come to breakfastwith me in good fellowship or to spoil mymeal this morning as you did my supper lastnight by asking untimely questions i will pick a bone with you with all myheart said albert and if you please doctori would ask some questions which seem notquite untimely woodstockso saying he sat down and assisted the doctorin giving a very satisfactory account of a braceof wild ducks and a leash of teal bevis whomaintained his place with great patience and insinuationhad his share of a collop which was alsoplaced on the wellfurnished board for like mosthighbred dogs he declined eating waterfowlcome hither then albert lee said thedoctor laying down his knife and fork and pluckingthe towel from his throat so soon as jocelinewas withdrawn thou art still the same lad thouwert when i was thy tutor never satisfied withhaving got a grammar rule but always persecutingme with questions why the rule stood so and nototherwise over curious after information whichthou could'st not comprehend as bevis hungeredand whined for the duckwing which he could noteati hope you will find me more reasonabledoctor answered albert and at the sametime that you will recollect i am not now stibjhrtda but am placed in circumstances where i amnot at liberty to act upon the ipse dixit of anywooitoic man unless my own judgment be convinced shall deserve richly to be hanged drawn andquartered should any misfortune happen by mymisgovernment in this businessand it is therefore albert that i wouldhave thee trust the whole to me without interferingthou mayest forsooth thou art not sub ferula but recollect that while you have been fightingin the field i have been plotting in the studythat i know all the combinations of the king'sfriends ay and all the motions of his enemies aswell as a spider knows every mesh of his webthink of my experience man not a cavalier inthe land but has heard of rochecliite the plotteri have been a main limb in everything that hasbeen attempted since fortytwo penned declarationsconducted correspondence communicatedwith chiefs recruited followers commissionedarms levied money appointed rendezvous i wasin the western rising and before that in thecity petition and in sir john owen's stir inwales in short almost in every plot for the kingsince tomkins and challenger's matterbut were not all these plots unsuccessful vol ii r woodstockgait albert and were not tomkins and challengerhanged doctor yes my young friend answered the doctorgravely as many others have been with whomi have acted but only because they did not followmy advice implicitly you never heard that iwas hanged myselfthe time may come doctor said albert the pitcher goes oft to the well the proverbas my father would say is somewhat musty buti too have some confidence in my own judgement and much as i honour the church i cannotaltogether subscribe to passive obedience iwill tell you in one word what points i must haveexplanation on and it will remain with you togive it or to return a message to the king thatyou will not explain your plan in which case ifhe acts by my advice he will leave woodstockand resume his purpose of getting to the coastwithout delaywell then thou suspicious monster makethy demands and if they be such as i can answerwithout betraying confidence i will reply tothemwoodstock in the first place then what is all this storyabout ghosts and witchcraft and apparitions and do you consider it as safe for his majesty tostay in a house subject to such visitations real orpretended you must be satisfied with my answer in verbasacerdotal the circumstances you allude to willnot give the least annoyance to woodstock duringthe king's residence i cannot explain farther but for this i will be bound at the risk ofmy neckthen said lee we must take the doctorfor bail that the devil will keep the peace towardsour sovereign lord the king good now therelurked about this house the greater part of yesterdayand perhaps slept here a fellow called tompkins a bitter independent and a secretary orsomething qr other to the regicide dog desboroughthe man is well known a wild ranterin religious opinions but in private affairs farsightedcunning and interested even as anyrogue of them allbe assured we will avail ourselves of his crazyfanaticism to mislead his wicked cunning swoodstockchild may lead a hog if it has wit to fasten a cordto the ring in its nose replied the doctoryou may be deceived said albert theage has many such as this fellow whose views ofthe spiritual and temporal world are so differentthat they resemble the eyes of a squinting man one of which oblique and distorted sees nothingbut the end of his nose while the other instead ofpartaking the same defect views strongly sharplyand acutely whatever is subjected to its scrutinybut we will put a patch on the better eyesaid the doctor and he shall only be allowed tospeculate with the imperfect optic you mustknow this fellow has always seen the greatestnumber and the most hideous apparitions hehas not the courage of a cat in such mattersthough stout enough when he hath temporal antagonistsbefore him i have placed him underthe charge of joceline joliffe who betwixt plyinghim with sack and ghoststories would makehim incapable of knowing what was done if youwere to proclaim the king in his presencebut why keep such a fellow here at all oh sir content you he lies leaguer as awoodstock sort of ambassador for his worthy masters andwe are secure from any intrusion so long as theyget all the news of woodstock from trusty tompkinsi know joceline's honesty well said albert and if he can assure me that he will keep awatch over this fellow i will so far trust in himhe does not know the depth of the stake tistrue but that my life is concerned will be quiteenough to keep him vigilant well then i proceed what if markham everard comes downtil'on us rwe have his word to the contrary answeredrochecliife his word of honour transmittedby his friend do you think it likely he willbreak it ri hold him incapable of doing so answeredalbert andbesides i think markham wouldmake no bad use of anything which might cometo his knowledge yet god forbid we should beunder the necessity of trusting any who ever worethe parliament's colours in a matter of such dearconcernment amen said the doctor are your doubtssilenced now woodstocki still have an objection said albert toyonder impudent rakehelly fellow styling himselfa cavalier who pushed himself on our companylast night and gained my father's heart bya story of the storm of brentford which i daresaythe rogue never sawyou mistake him dear albert roger wildrakealthough till of late i only knew him bynameis a gentleman was bred at the inns ofcourt and spent his estate in the king's serviceor rather in the devil's service said albertit is such fellows as he who sunk from the licenseof their military habits into idle debauchedruffians infest the land with riots and robberiesbrawl in hedge alehouses and cellars where strongwaters are sold at midnight and with their deepoaths their hot loyalty and their drunken valourmake decent men abominate the very nameof cavalieralas said the doctor it is but too true but what can you expect when the higher andmore qualified classes are broken down and mingledundistinguishable with the lower orders they areapt to lose the most valuable marks of their quawoodstockcity in the general confusion of morals and manners just as a handful of silver medals will becomedefaced and discoloured if jumbled aboutamong the vulgar copper coin even the primemedal of all which we royalists would so willinglywear next our very hearts has not perhaps entirelyescaped some deterioration but let othertongues than mine speak on that subjectalbert lee paused deeply after having heardthese communications on the part of rochecliffe doctor he said it is generally agreedeven by some who think you may occasionallyhave been a little over busy in putting men upondangerous actions may god forgive them who entertain sofalse an opinion of me said the doctorthat nevertheless you have done andsuffered more in the king's behalf than any manof your functionthey do me but justice there said doctorrochecliffe absolute justicei am therefore disposed to abide by youropinion if all things considered you think itsafe that we should remain at woodstock woodstockthat is not the question answered thedivineand what is the question then replied theyoung soldierwhether any safer course can be pointedout i grieve to say that the question must becomparative as to the point of option absolutesafety is alas the while out of the question onall sides now i say woodstock is fenced andguarded as at present by far the most preferableplace of concealmentenough i give up to you the question asto a person whose knowledge of such importantaffairs not to mention your age and experience ismore intimate and extensive than mine can beyou do well answered rochecliffe andif others had acted with the like distrust of theirown knowledge and confidence in competent personsit had been better for the age this makesunderstanding bar himself up within his fortaliceand wit betake himself to his high tower herehe looked around his cell with an air of selfcomplacence the wise man foreteeth the tempestand lieth himsclkwoodstock doctor said albert let our foresight serveothers far more precious than either of us letme ask you if you have well considered whetherour precious charge should remain in society withthe family or betake himself to some of the morehidden corners of the house hum i think he will be safest as louiskerneguy keeping himself close beside you i fear it will be necessary that i scout abroada little and show myself in some distant part ofthe country lest coming here in quest of methey should find higher gamepray do not interrupt me keeping himselfclose beside you or your father in or near tovictor lee's apartment from which you are awarehe can make a ready escape should danger approach this occurs to me as best for the present i hope to hear of the vessel today tomorrowat farthestalbert lee bid the active but opinionated mangood morrow admiring how this species of intriguehad become a sort of element in which thedoctor seemed to enjoy himself notwithstandingall that the poet has said concerning the horrorsfi woodstockwhich intervene betwixt the conception and executionof a conspiracyin returning from doctor rochecliffe's sanctuaryhe met with eocene who was anxiously seekinghim the young scotch gentleman he saidin a mysterious manner has arisen from bedand hearing me pass he called me into his apartmentwell replied albert i will see him presentlyand he asked me for fresh linen and clothesnow sir he is like a man who is quite accustomedto be obeyed so i gave him a suit which happenedto be in a wardrobe in the west tower andsome of your linen to conform and when he wasdressed he commanded me to show him to thepresence of sir henry lee and my young ladyi would have said something sir about waitingtill you came back but he pulled me goodnaturedlyby the hair as indeed he has a rarehumour of his own and told me he was guest tomaster albert lee and not his prisoner sosir though i thought you might be displeasedwithme for giving him the means of stirringwoodstock abroad and perhaps being seen by those whoshould not see him what could i say you are a sensible fellow joceline andcomprehend always what is recommended to youthis youth will not be controlled i fearby either of us but we must look the closerafter his safety you keep your watch over thatprying fellow the steward trust him to my care on that side have nofear but ah sir i would we had the youngscot in his old clothes again for the ridingsuitof yours which he now wears hath set him off inotherguess fashionfrom the manner in which the faithful dependentexpressed himself albert saw that he suspectedwho the scottish page in reality was yethe did not think it proper to acknowledge tohim a fact of such importance secure as he wasequally of his fidelity whether explicitly trustedto the full extent or left to his own conjecturesfull of anxious thought he went to the apartmentof victor lee in which joliife told him hewould find the party assembled the sound oflaughter as he laid his hand on the lock of the woodstockdoor almost made him start so singularly did itjar with the doubtful and melancholy reflectionswhich engaged his own mind he entered andfound his father in high good humour laughingand conversing freely with his young charge whoseappearance was indeed so much changed to thebetter in externals that it seemed scarce possiblea night's rest a toilette and a suit of decentclothes could have done so much in his favour inso short a time it could not however be imputedto the mere alteration of dress although that nodoubt had its effect there was nothing splendidin that which louis kerneguy we continue to callhim by his assumed name now wore it wasmerely a ridingsuit of grey cloth with seme silverlace in the fashion of a country gentleman ofthe time but it happened to fit him very wellandto become his very dark complexion especiallyas he now held up his head and used themanners not only of a wellbehaved but of a gentleman when he movedhis clumsy and awkward limp was exchanged forasort of shuffle which as it might be the consequenceof a wound in those perilous times hadwoodstock rather an interesting than an ungainly effect atleast it was as genteel an expression that the partyhad been overheard travelled as the most politepedestrian could propose to himselfthe features of the wanderer were harsh asever but his red shock peruke for such it provedwas laid aside his sable elflocks were trainedby a little of joceline's assistance into curls andhis fine black eyes shone from among the shadeof these curls and corresponded with the animatedthough not handsome character of the wholehead in his conversation he had laid asideall the coarseness of dialect which he had sostrongly affected on the preceding evening andalthough he continued to speak a little scotchfor the support of his character as a young gentlemanof that nation yet it was not in a degreewhich either rendered his speech uncouthor unintelligible but merely afforded a certaindoric tinge essential to the personage he representedno person on earth could better understandthe society in which he moved exile hadmade him acquainted with life in all its shadesand varieties his spirits if not uniform were woodstockelastic he had that species of epicurean philosophywhich even in the most extreme difficultiesand dangers can in an interval of ease availitself of the enjoyments of the

impossible to retain thefull sense of his wrongsalbert lee found the party consisting of hisfather sister and the supposed page seated bythe breakfast table at which he also took hisplace he was a pensive and anxious beholderof what passed while the page who had alreadycompletely gained the heart of the good old cavalierby mimicking the manner in which thescotch divines preached in favour of ma gudelord marquis of argyle and the solemn leagueand covenant was now endeavouring to interestwoodstock jthe fair alice by such anecdotes partly of warlikeand perilous adventure as possessed the same degreeof interest for the female ear which they havehad ever since desdemona's days but it was notonly of dangers by land and sea that the disguisedpage spoke but much more and much oftener onforeign revels banquets balls where the pride offrance of spain or of the low countries was exhibitedin the eyes of their most eminent beautiesalice being a very young girl who in consequenceof the civil war had been almost entirely educatedin the country and often in great seclusionit was certainly no wonder that she should listenwith willing ears and a ready smile to what theyoung gentleman their guest and her brother's protegetold with so much gaiety and mingled withsuch a shade of dangerous adventure and occasionallyof serious reflection as prevented the discoursefrom being regarded as merely light and frivolousin a word sir henry lee laughed alicesmiled from time to time and au were well satisfiedbut albert who would himself however havebeen scarce able to allege a sufficient reason forhis depression of spirits woodstockthe materials of breakfast were at last removedunder the active superintendence of the neathandedphoebe who looked over her shoulderand lingered more than once to listen to thefluent discourse of their new guest whom on thepreceding evening she had while in attendanceat supper accounted one of the most stupid inmatesto whom the gates of woodstock had beenopened since the times of fair rosamondlouis kerneguy then when they were left onlyfour in the chamber without the interruption ofdomestics and the successive bustle occasioned bythe discussion and removal

engagingthe attention of those members of his family towhom he had become so recently known he wentbehind his chair therefore and leaning on theback said with a goodhumoured tone whichmade his purpose

it nogood excuse for your sullen silence albert youhave met your sister and me so long separatedfrom you so anpious on your behalf almost likemere strangers and yet you are returned safe tousand you

abovit whose then should you be anxiousall accounts agree that the king is safe out ofthe dogs jawsnot without some danger though mutteredlouis thinking of his encounter with bevis onthe preceding

fortune is escaped so all news affirm escapedfrom bristol if i thought otherwise alberti should be as sad as you are for the rest of iti have lurked a month in this house when discoverywould have been

much the worse that his bestsubjects were seized with dejection on his accountyou answer boldly on the king's part youngman said sir henryoh my father was meikle about the king'shand answered louis recollecting his presentcharacterno wonder then said sir henry thatyou have so soon recovered your good spirits andgood breeding when you heard of his majesty'sescape why you are no more like the lad wesaw last night than the best hunter i ever had waslike a drayhorseoh there is much in rest and food andgrooming answered louis you would hardlyknow the tired jade you dismounted from lastnight when she is brought out prancing and neighingthe next morning rested refreshed and readyto start again especially if the brute hath somegood blood for such pick up unco fastwell then but since thy father was a courtierand thou hast learned i think something rvf woodstockthe trade tell us a little master kerneguy abouthim we love most to hear about the king we areall safe and secret you need not be afraid hewas a hopeful youth i trust his flourishing blossomnow gives promise of fruit as the knight spoke louis bent his eyes onthe ground and seemed at first uncertain what toanswer but admirable at extricating himself fromsuch dilemmas he replied that he really couldnot presume to speak on such a subject in thepresence of his patron colonel albert lee whomust be a much better judge of the character ofking charles than he could pretend to bealbert was accordingly next assailed by theknight seconded by alice for some account ofhis majesty s characteri will speak but according to facts saidalbert and then i must be acquitted of partialityif the king had not possessed enterpriseand military skill he never would have attemptedthe expedition to worcester had he not hadpersonal courage he had not so long disputed thebattle that cromwell almost judged it lost thathe possesses prudence and patience must be arwoodstockgucd from the circumstances attending his flight and that he has the love of his subjects is evidentsince necessarily known to many he has been betrayedby nonefor shame albert replied his sister isthat the way a good cavalier doles out the characterof his prince applying an instance at everyconcession like a pedlar measuring linen with hisrod out upon you no wonder you were beatenif you fought as coldly for your king as yoinow talk for himi did my best to trace a likeness from what ihave seen and known of the original sister alicereplied her brother if you would have a fancyportrait you must get an artist of more imaginationthan i have to draw it for youi will be that artist myself said alice andin my portrait our monarch shall show all that heought to be having such high pretensions allthat he must be being so loftily descended allthat i am sure he is and that every loyal heartin the kingdom ought to believe him well said alice quoth the old knight woodstocklook thou upon this picture and on this here is our young friend shall judge i wager mybest nag that is i would wager him had i oneleft that alice proves the better painter of thetwo my son's brain is still misty i think sincehis defeat he has not got the smoke of worcesterout of it plague on thee a young man andcast down for one beating had you been bangedtwenty times like me it had been time to lookgrave but come alice forward the colours aremixed on your pallet forward with somethingthat shall show like one of vandyke's living portraitsplaced beside the dull dry presentationthere of our ancestor victor leealice it must be observed had been educatedby her father in the notions of high and even exaggeratedloyalty which characterized the cavaliersand she was really an enthusiast in the royalcause but besides she was in good spirits at herbrother's happy return and wished to prolongthe gay humour in which her father had of latescarcely ever indulgedwell then she said though i am no apelwoodstock qles i will try to paint an alexander such as ihope and am

commonwealthat seated there he may be blest while livingand so long remembered when dead that for agesafter it shall be thought sacrilege to breathe anaspersion against the throne which he has occupied long after he is dead while there remainsan old man who has seen him were the conditionof that survivor no higher than a groom or amenial his age shall be provided for at the publiccharge and his gray hairs regarded with moredistinction than an ears coronet because he remembersthe second charles the monarch ofevery heart in england while alice spoke she was hardly consciousof the presence of any one save her father and woodstockbrother for the page withdrew himself somewhatfrom the circle and there was nothing to remindher of him she gave the reins therefore to herenthusiasm and as the tears glittered in her eyeand her beautiful features became animated sheseemed like a descended cherub proclaiming thevirtues of a patriot monarch the person chieflyinterested in her description held himself back aswe have said and concealed his own features yetso as to preserve a full view of the beautifulspeakeralbert lee conscious in whose presence thiseulogium was pronounced was much embarrassed but his father all whose feelings were flatteredby the panegyric was in raptureso much for the king alice he said andnow for the memfor the man replied alice in the same toneneed wish him more than the paternal virtuesof his unhappy father of whom his worst enemieshave recorded that if moral virtues and religiousfaith were to be selected as the qualities whichmerited a crown no man could plead the possessionof them in a higher or more indisputable dcwoodstockgrec temperate wise and frugal yet munificentin rewarding merit a friend to letters andthe muses but a severe discourager of the misuseof such gifts a worthy gentleman a kind master the best friend the best father the bestchristian her voice began to falter andher father's handkerchief was already at his eyeshe was girl he was exclaimed sir henry but no more on't i charge ye no more on'tenough let his son but possess his virtues withbetter advisers and better fortunes and he willbe all that england in her warmest wishes coulddesirethere was a pause after this for alice felt asif she had spoken too frankly and too zealouslyfor her sex and youth sir henry was occupiedin melancholy recollections on the fate of his latesovereign while kerneguy and his supposed patronfelt embarrassed perhaps from a consciousnessthat the real charles fell far short of his idealcharacter as designed in such glowing colours insome cases exaggerated or inappropriate praisebecomes the most severe satire woodstockbut such reflections were not of a nature to belongwillingly cherished by the person to whomthey might have been of great advantage he assumeda tone of raillery which is perhaps thereadiest mode of escaping from the feelings of selfreproof every cavalier he said shouldbend his knee to thank mistress alice lee forhaving made such a flattering portrait of the kingtheir master by laying under contribution for hisbenefit the virtues of all his ancestors only therewas one point he would not have expected a femalepainter to have passed over in silence when shemade him in right of his grandfather and fathera muster of royal and individual excellencies whycould she not have endowed him at the same timewith his mother's personal charms why shouldnot the son of henrietta maria the finest womanof her day add the recommendations of ahandsome face and figure to his internal evxl ii u woodstockcome very imminent he was glad therefore ofcomparative repose and of comparative safetythen it must be considered that charles hadbeen entirely reconciled to the society at woodstocksince he had become better acquainted withit he had seen that to interest the beautifulalice and procure a great deal of her companynothing more was necessary than to submit to thehumours and cultivate the intimacy of the oldcavalier her father a few bouts at fencing inwhich charles took care not to put out his moreperfect skill and full youthful strength and activity the endurance of a few scenes from shakspearewhich the knight read with more zeal thantaste a little skill in music in which the oldman had been a proficient the deference paid toa few oldfashioned opinions at which he laughedin his sleeve were allsufficient to gain for thedisguised prince an interest in sir henry leeand to conciliate in an equal degree the goodwillof his lovely daughternever were two young persons who could besaid to commence this species of intimacy withsuch unequal advantages charles was a liberwoodstocktine who if he did not in cold blood resolve uponprosecuting his passion for auce to a dishonourableconclusion was at every moment liableto be provoked to attempt the strength of a virtuein which he was no believer then auce on herpart hardly knew even what was implied by theword libertine or seducer her mother had diedearly in the commencement of the civil war andshe had been bred up chiefly with her brother andcousin so that she had an unfearing and unsuspiciousfrankness of manner upon which charleswas not unwilling or unlikely to put a constructionfavourable to his own views even alice'slove for her cousin the first sensation whichawakens the most innocent and simple mind tofeelings of shyness and restraint towards the malesex in general had failed to awaken such analarm in her bosom they were nearly related and everard though young was several yearsher elder and had from her infancy been anobject of her respect as well as of her affectionwhen this early and childish intimacy ripenedinto youthful love confessed and returned stillit differed in some shades from the passion existswoodstocking between lovers originally strangers to eachother until their affections have been united in theordinary course of courtship their love wasfonder more familiar more perfectly confidential purer too perhaps and more free from starts ofpassionate violence or apprehensive jealousythe possibility that any one could have attemptedto rival everard in her affection was acircumstance which never occurred to alice andthat this singular scottish lad whom she laughedwith on account of his humour and laughedat for his peculiarities should be an object ofdanger or of caution never once entered herimagination the sort of intimacy to which sheadmitted kerneguy was the same to which shewould have received a companion of her own sexwhose manners she did not always approve butwhose society she found amusingit was natural that the freedom of alice lee'sconduct which arose from the most perfect indifferenceshould pass for something approachingto encouragement in the royal gallant's apprehensionand that any resolutions he had formedagainst being tempted to violate the hospitalitywoodstock of woodstock should begin to totter as opportunitiesfor doing so became more frequentthese opportunities were favoured by albert'sdeparture from woodstock the very day after hisarrival it had been agreed in full council withcharles and rochecliffe that lee should go tovisit his uncle everard in the county of kentand by showing himself there should obviateany cause of suspicion which might arise fromhis residence at woodstock and remove any pretextfor disturbing his father's family on accountof their harbouring one who had been so latelyin arms he had also undertaken at his owngreat personal risk to visit different points on theseacoast and ascertain the security of differentplaces for providing shipping for the king's leavingenglandthese circumstances were alike calculated toprocure the king's safety and facilitate his escapebut alice was thereby deprived of the presenceof her brother who would have been her mostwatchful guardian but who had set down theking's light talk upon a former occasion to thegaiety of his humour and would have thought woodstockhe had done his sovereign great injustice hadhe seriously suspected him of such a breach ofhospitality as a dishonourable pursuit of alicewould have impliedthere were however two of the household atwoodstock who appeared not so entirely reconciledwith louis kerneguy or his purposes theone was bevis who seemed from their first unfriendlyrencontre to have kept up a pique againsttheir new guest which no advances on the part ofcharles were able to soften if the page wasby chance left alone with his young mistress bevischose always to be of the party came closeby alice's chair and growled audibly when thegallant drew near her it is a pity said thedisguised prince that your bevis is not a bulldogthat we might dub him a roundhead atonce he is too handsome too noble too aristocraticto nourish those inhospitable prejudicesagainst a poor houseless cavalier i am convincedthe spirit of pym or hampden has transmigratedinto the rogue and continues to demonstratehis hatred against royalty and all its adherentswojstock alice would then reply that bevis was loyalin word and deed and only partook her father'sprejudices against the scots which she could notbut acknowledge were tolerably strongnay then said the supposed louis imust find some other reason for i cannot allowsir bevis's resentment to rest upon national antipathyso we will suppose that some gallantcavalier who wended to the wars and never returnedhas adopted this shape to look back uponthe haunts he left so unwillingly and is jealousat seeing even poor louis kerneguy drawing nearto the lady of his lost affections he approachedher chair as he spoke and bevis gave one ofhis deep growls in that case you had best keep your distancesaid alice laughing for the bite of adog possessed by the ghost of a jealous lovercannot be very safe and the king carried onthe dialogue in the same strain which while itled alice to apprehend nothing more seriousthan the apish gallantry of a fantastic boy certainlyinduced the supposed louis kerneguy tothink that he had made one of those conquests woodstockwhich often and easily fall to the share of sovereignsnotwithstanding the acuteness of his apprehensionhe was not sufficiently aware thatthe royal road to female favour is only open tomonarch s when they travel in grand costume andthat when they woo incognito their path of courtshipis liable to the same windings and obstacleswhich obstruct the course of private individualsthere was besides bevis another member ofthe family who kept a lookout upon louiskerneguy and with no friendly eye phoebemayflower though her experience extended notbeyond the sphere of the village yet knew theworld much better than her mistress and besidesshe was five years older more knowingshe was more suspicious she thought that oddlookingscotch boy made more up to her youngmistress than was proper for his condition oflife and moreover that alice gave him a littlemore encouragement than parthenon

true love being obstructed withoutattempting a remedy she had a peculiarfavour for markham herself and moreover hewas according to her phrase as handsome andpersonable a young man as was in oxfordshire and this scotch scarecrow was no more to becompared to him than chalk was to cheese andyet she allowed that master girnigy had a wonderfullywelloiled tongue and that such gallantswere not to be despised what was to be done she had no facts to offer only vague suspicion and was afraid to speak to her mistress whosekindness great as it was did not neverthelessencourage familiarityshe sounded joceline but he was she knewnot why so deeply interested about this unluckylad and held this importance so high that shecould make no impression on him to speakto the old knight would have been to raic a gc woodstockneral tempest the worthy chaplain who was atwoodstock grand referee on all disputed matterswould have been the damsels most natural resourcefor he was peaceful as well as moral byprofession and politic by practice but it happenedhe had given phoebe unintentional offenceby speaking of her under the classical epithet ofrustica fidele the which epithet as she understoodit not she held herself bound to resent ascontumelious and declaring she was not fonder ofa fiddle than other folks had ever since shunnedall intercourse with doctor rochecliffe which shecould easily avoidmaster tomkins was always coming and goingabout the house under various pretexts but hewas a roundhead and she was too true to the cavaliersto introduce any of the enemy as partiesto their internal discords besides he had talkedto phoebe herself in a manner which induced herto decline everything in the shape of familiaritywith him lastly cavaliers wildrake might havebeen consulted but phoebe had her own reasonsfor saying as she did with some emphasis thatcavaliers wildrake was an impudent londonwoodstock rake at length she resolved to communicateher suspicions to the party having

princesometimes thinking on the intrigue which fortuneseemed to have thrown in his way for hisamusement and taking advantage of such opportunitiesas occurred to increase his intimacy withalice lee but much oftener harassing doctorrochecliffe with questions about the possibilityof escape which the good man finding himself unableto answer secured his leisure against royal woodstockimportunity by retreating into the various unexploredrecesses of the lodge known perhapsonly to himself who had been for nearly a scoreof years employed in writing the wonders ofavoid stockit chanced on the fourth day that some triflingcircumstance had called the knight abroad and he had left the young scotchman now familiarin the family alone with alice in the parlourof victor lee thus situated he thought thetime not unpropitious for entering upon a strainof gallantry of a kind which might be called experimentalsuch as is practised by the croats inskirmishing when they keep bridle in hand readyto attack the enemy or canter off without comingto close quarters as circumstances may recommendafter using for nearly ten minutes asort of metaphysical jargon which might accordingto ahces pleasure have been interpretedeither into gallantry or the language of seriouspretension and when he supposed her engagedin fathoming his meaning he had the mortificationto find by a single and brief question thathe had been totally unattended to and that alicewoodstock was thinking on anything at the moment ratherthan the sense of what he had been saying sheasked him if he could tell what it was o'clockand this with an air of real curiosity concerningthe lapse of time which put coquetry wholly outof the questioni will go look at the sundial mistressalice said the gallant rising and colouringthrough a sense of the contempt with which hethought himself treatedyou will do me a pleasure master kerneguysaid alice without the least consciousnessof the indignation she had excitedmaster louis kerneguy left the room accordinglynot however to procure the informationrequired but to vent his anger and mortificationand to swear with more serious purpose than hehad dared to do before that alice should rueher insolence goodnatured as he was he wasstill a prince unaccustomed to contradiction farless to contempt and his self pride felt for themoment wounded to the quick with a hastystep he plunged into the chase only rememberinghis own safety so far as to choose the deeper woodstockand sequestered avenues where walking on withthe speedy and active step which his recoveryfrom fatigue now permitted him to exercise accordingto his wont he solaced his angry purposesby devising schemes of revenge on theinsolent country coquette from which no considerationof hospitality was in future to haveweight enough to save herthe irritated gallant passedthe dialstone aged and greenwithout deigning to ask it a single question norcould it have satisfied his curiosity if he had forno sun happened to shine at the moment hethen hastened forward muffling himself in hiscloak and assuming a stooping and slouchinggait which diminished his apparent height hewas soon involved in the deep and dim alleys ofthe wood into which he had insensibly plungedhimself and was traversing it at a great ratewithout having any distinct idea in what directionhe was going when suddenly his course wasarrested first by a loud hollo and then by asummons to stand accompanied by what seemedwoodstock still more startling and extraordinary the touchof a cane upon his shoulder imposed in a goodhumouredbut somewhat imperious mannerthere were few symptoms of recognition whichwould have been welcome at this moment butthe appearance of the person who had thus arrestedhis course was least of all that he couldhave anticipated as timely or agreeable when heturned on receiving the signal he beheld himselfclose to a young man nearly six feet in heightwell made in joint and limb but the gravity ofwhose apparel although handsome and gentlemanlikeand a sort of precision in his habitfrom the cleanness and stiffness of his band tothe unsullied purity of his spanish leather shoesbespoke a love of order which was foreign to theimpoverished and vanquished cavaliers and properto the habits of those of the victorious partywho could afford to dress themselves handsomely and whose rule that is such as regarded thehigher and more respectable classes enjoineddecency and sobriety of garb and deportmentthere was yet another weight against the princein the scale and one still more characteristic of woodstockthe inequality in the comparison under which heseemed to labour there was strength in themuscular form of the stranger who had broughthim to this involuntary parley authority and determinationin his brow a long rapier on the leftand a poniard or dagger on the right side of hisbelt and a pair of pistols stuck into it whichwould have been sufficient to give the unknownthe advantage louis kerneguy having no weaponbut his sword even had his personal strengthapproached nearer than it did to that of the personby whom he was thus suddenly stoppedbitterly regretting the thoughtless fit of passionthat brought him into his present situationbut especially the want of the pistols he had leftbehind and which do so much to place bodilystrength and weakness upon an equal footingcharles yet availed himself of the courage andpresence of mind in which few of his unfortunatefamily had for centuries been deficient hestood firm and without motion his cloak stillwrapped round the lower part of his face togive time for explanation in case he was mistakenfor some other personwoodstockthis coolness produced its effect for the otherparty said with doubt and surprise on his partjoceline johffe is it not if i know not jofelinejoliffe i should at least know my owncloaki am not joceline joliffe as you may seesir said kerneguy calmly drawing himselferect to show the difference of size and droppingthe cloak from his face and personindeed replied the stranger in surprise then sir unknown i have to express my regretat having used my cane in intimating that iwished you to stop from that dress which icertainly recognize for my own i concluded youmust be joceline in whose custody i had left myhabit at the lodgeif it had been joceline sir replied thesupposed kerneguy with perfect composuremethinks you should not have struck so hardthe other party was obviously confused bythe steady calmness with which he was encounteredthe sense of politeness dictated in the firstplace an apology for a mistake when he thoughthe had been tolerably certain of the person masvolii x woodstockter kerneguy was not in a situation to be punctilious he bowed gravely as indicating his acceptanceof the excuse offered then turned andwalked as he conceived towards the lodgethough he had traversed the woods which werecut with various alleys in different directions toohastily to be certain of the real course which hewished to pursuehe was much embarrassed to find that thisdid not get him rid of the companion whom hehad thus involuntarily acquired walked heslow walked he fast his friend in the genteelbut puritanic habit strong in person and wellarmed as we have described him seemed determinedto keep him company and without attemptingto join or enter into conversation neversuffered him to outstrip his surveillance for morethan two or three yards the wanderer mendedhis pace but although he was then in hisyouth as afterwards in his riper age one of thebest walkers in britain the stranger without advancinghis pace to a run kept fully equal tohim and his persecution became so close andconstant and inevitable that the pride and fearwoodstock of charles were both alarmed and he began tothink that whatever the danger might be of asinglehanded rencontre he would neverthelesshave a better bargain of this tall satellite if theysettled the debate betwixt them in the forest thanif they drew near any place of habitation wherethe man in authority was likely to find friends andconcurrencebetwixt anxiety therefore vexation and angercharles faced suddenly round on his pursuer asthey reached a small narrow glade which led tothe little meadow over which presided the kmgsoak the ragged and scathed branches and gigantictrunk of which formed

willing to render you personal satisfactionif your purpose is merely impertinentcuriosity i let you know that i will not suffermyself to be dogged in my private walks by anyonewhen i recognize my own

i had as good a right to stretch my caneacross the cloak you are muffled in as ever hadany one to brush his own garments if thereforewg are to be friends i must ask for instancehow you came by that cloak and where you aregoing with it i shall otherwise make bold to stopyou as one who has sufficient commission to dosooh unhappy cloak thought the wandereray and thrice unhappy the idle fancy that

stranger who was no other than markhameverard i will convince you that you are betterknown than you think fornow heaven forbid prayed the party addressedin silence but with as much devotion asever he applied to a prayer in his life yet evenin this moment of extreme urgency his courageand composure did not fail and he recollectedit was of the utmost importance not to seem startledand to answer so
