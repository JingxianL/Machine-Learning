wrought allthese marvels was a disguised royalist a fellow called trusty joe or some suchname formerly in the service of the keeperof the park but who engaged in that ofthe commissioners on purpose to subjectthem to his persecution i think i haveseen some account of the real state of thetransaction and of the machinery by whichthe wizard worked his wonders but whetherin a book or a pamphlet i am uncertaini remember one passage particularlyto this purpose the commissioners havingagreed to retain some articles out of thepublic account in order to be divided amongthemselves had entered into an

neighbourhood of woodstock were assembledto conjure down the supposed demontrusty joe had contrived a fireworkwhich he let off in the midst of the exorcismand which destroyed the bowpot and to the shame and confusion of thecommissioners threw their secret indentureinto the midst of the assembled ghostseerswho became thus acquainted withtheir schemes of peculationit is however to little purpose for meto strain my memory about ancient andimperfect recollections concerning the particularsof these fantastic disturbances atwoodstock since doctor rochecliffe's papersgive such a much more accurate narrativethan could be obtained from any accountin existence before their publicationindeed i might have gone much more fullyinto this part of my subject for the mateprefacexvrials are ample but to

character he slackenedhis stately and consequential pace and atlength stood still and looked around himnot far from the gate he saw rising from thetrees one or two ancient and venerable turretsbearing each its own vane of rare device glitteringin the autumn sun these indicated theancient hunting seat or lodge as it was calledwhich had since the time of henry ii been occasionallythe residence of the english monarchswhen it pleased them to visit the woods of oxfordwhich then so abounded with game that accordingto old fuller huntsmen and falconerswere nowhere better pleased the situation whichthe lodge occupied was a piece of flat ground nowplanted with sycamores not far from the entranceto that magnificent spot where the spectator firststops to gaze upon blenheim to think of marlswoodstockborough's victories and to applaud or criticisethe cumbrous magnificence of hamburgh's stylethere too paused our military preacher butwith other thoughts and for other purpose thanto admire the scene around him it was not longafterwards when he beheld two persons a maleand a female approaching slowly and so deeplyengaged in their own conversation that they didnot raise their eyes to observe that there stood astranger in the path before them the soldiertook advantage of their state of abstraction anddesirous at once to watch their motions and avoidtheir observation he glided beneath one of thehuge trees which skirted the path and whoseboughs sweeping the ground on every side insuredhim against discovery unless in case of anactual searchin the meantime the gentleman and lady continuedto advance directing their course to a rusticseat which still enjoyed the sunbeams andwas placed adjacent to the tree where the strangerwas concealedthe man was elderly yet seemed bent morewoods took by sorrow and infirmity than by the weight ofyears he wore a mourning cloak over a dressof the same melancholy colour cut in that picturesqueform which vandyke has rendered immortalbut although the dress was handsomeit was put on and worn with a carelessness whichshowed the mind of the wearer ill at ease hisaged yet still handsome countenance had thesame air of consequence which distinguished hisdress and his gait a striking part of his appearancewas a long white beard which descendedfar over the breast of his slashed doublet andlooked singular from its contrast jn colour withhis habitthe young lady by whom this venerable gentlemanseemed to be in some degree supportedas they walked arm in arm was a slight andsylphlike form with a person so delicately madeand so beautiful in countenance that it seemedthe earth on which she walked was too grossly massivea support for a creature so aerial but mortalbeauty must share human sorrows the eyes ofthe beautiful being showed tokens of tears hercolour was heightened as she listened to her agedvol i c woodstockcompanion and it was plain from his melancholyyet displeased look that the conversation was asdistressing to himself as to her when they satedown on the bench we have mentioned the gentleman'sdiscourse could be distinctly overheardby the evesdropping soldier but the answers ofthe young lady reached his ear rather less distinctlyit is not to be endured said the old manpassionately it would stir up a paralyticwretch to start up a soldier my people havebeen thinned i grant you or have fallen offfrom me in these times i owe them no grudgefor it poor knaves what should they do whenthe pantry has no bread and the buttery no ale but we have still about us some rugged forestersof the old woodstock breed old as myself mostof them what of that old wood seldom warpsin the wetting i will hold out the old houseand it will not be the first time that i have heldit against ten times the strength that we hearof now immmlalas my dear father said the younglady in a tone which seemed to intimate his proposalof defence to be altogether desperatewoodstock and why alas said the gentleman angrily is it because i shut my door on a score or twoof these bloodthirsty hypocrites but their masters can as easily send a regimentor an army if they wills replied the lady and what good would your present defence doexcepting to exasperate them to your utter destructionbe it so alice replied her father i havelived my time and beyond it i have outlivedthe kindest and most princelike of masterswhat do i do on the earth since the dismalthirtieth of january the parricide of that daywas a signal to all true servants of charles stuartto avenge his death or die as soon after as theycould find a worthy opportunitydo not speak thus sir said alice lee it does not become your gravity and yourworth to throw away that life which may yet beof service to your king and country it will notand cannot always be thus england will notlong endure the rulers which these bad timeshave assigned her in the meanwhile herea few words escaped the listener's ears and woodstockbeware of that impatience which makes badworseworse exclaimed the impatient old manwhat can be worse is it not at the worst already will not these people expel us from theonly shelter we have left dilapidate what remainsof royal property under my charge make thepalace of princes into a den of thieves and thenwipe their mouths and thank god as if they haddone an alms deed still said his daughter there is hope behindand i trust the king is ere this out of theirreach we have reason to think well of my browther albert's safetyay albert there again said the old manin a tone of reproach had it not been for thyentreaties i had gone to worcester myself buti must needs lie here like a worthless houndwhen the hunt is up when who knows what servicei might have shown an old man's head issometimes useful when his arm is but little worthbut you and albert were so desirous that heshould go alone and now who can say what hasbecome of him woodstock nay nay father said alice we havegood hope that albert escaped from that fatalday young abney saw him a mile from the fieldyoung abney lied i believe said the fatherin the same humour of contradiction young abney's tongue seems quicker than hishands but far slower than his horse's heels whenhe leaves the roundheads behind him i wouldrather albert's dead body were laid betweencharles and cromwell than hear he fled as earlyas young abneymy dearest father said the young ladyweeping as she spoke what can i say to comfortyou comfort me say'st thou girl i am sick ofcomfort an honourable death with the ruins ofwoodstock for my monument were the onlycomfort to old henry lee yes by the memoryof my father i will make good the lodge againstthese rebellious robbers yet be ruled dearest father said the maiden and submit to that which we cannot gainsaymy uncle everard here the old man caught at her unfinished woodstockwords thy uncle everard wench well geton what of thy precious and loving uncleeverard nothing sir she said if the subject displeasesyou displeases me he replied why should itdisplease me or if it did why should'st thouor any one affect to care about it what is itthat hath happened of late years what is it canbe thought to happen that astrologer can guess atwhich can give pleasure to us fate she replied may have in store thejoyful restoration of our banished princetoo late for my time alice said the knight if there be such a white page in the heavenlybook it will not be turned until long after myday but i see thou wouldn't escape me in aword what of thy uncle everard nay sir said alice god knows i wouldrather be silent for ever than speak what mightas you would take it add to your present distemperaturedistemperature said her father oh thouart a sweetlipped physician and would'st i warwoodstocksrant me drop nought but sweet balm and ho ney and oil on my distemperature if that isthe phrase for an old man's ailment when he iswell nigh heartbroken once more what of thyuncle everard his last words were uttered in a high andpeevish tone of voice and alice lee answeredher father in a trembling and submissive tonei only meant to say sir that i am well assuredthat my uncle everard when we quit thisplace that is to say when we are kicked out of itby cropeared canting villains like himself buton with thy bountiful uncle what will he do will he give us the remains of his worshipfuland economical housekeeping the fragments ofa thricesacked capon twice aweek and a plentifulfast on the other aye days will he give usbeds beside his half starved nags and put themunder a short allowance of straw that his sister'shusband that i should have called my deceasedangel by such a name and his sister's daughtermay not sleep on the stones or will he send usanoble each with a warning to make it last for woodstockhe had never known the readypenny so hard tocome by or what else will your uncle everarddo for us get us a furlough to beg why ican do that without him you misconstrue him much answered alicewith more spirit than she had hitherto displayed and would you but question your own heartyou would acknowledge i speak with reverencethat your tongue utters what your better judgmentwould disown my uncle everard is neithera miser nor a hypocrite neither so fond of thegoods of this world that he would not supply ourdistresses amply nor so wedded to fanatical opinionsas to exclude charity for other sects besidehis own ay ay the church of england is a sectwith him i doubt not and perhaps with thee tooalice said the knight what is a mugglesman or a ranter or a brownish but a sectary and thy phrase places them all with jack presbyterhimself on the same footing with our learnedprelates and religious clergy such is the cantof the day thou livest in and why shouldst thounot talk like one of the wise virgins and psalmwoodstocksinging sisters since though thou hast a profaneold cavalier for a father thou art own niece touncle everard if you speak thus my dear fathers saidalice what can i answer you hear me butone patient word and i shall have discharged myuncle everard's commissionsoh it is a commission then surely i suspectedso much from the beginning nay havesome sharp guess touching the ambassador alsocome madam do your errand and you shallhave no reason to complain of my patiencethen sir replied his daughter my uncleeverard desires you would be courteous to thecommissioners who come here to sequestrate theparks and the property or at least heedfully toabstain from giving them obstacle or opposition it can he says do no good even on your ownprinciples and it will give a pretext for proceedingagainst you as one in the worst degree ofmalignity which he thinks may otherwise beprevented nay he has good hope that if youfollow his counsel the committee may throughthe interest he possesses be inclined to remove the woodstocksequestration of your estate on a moderate finethus says my uncle and having communicatedhis advice i have no occasion to urge your patiencewith farther argumentit is well thou dost not alice answered sirhenry lee in a tone of suppressed anger forbythe blessed rood thou hast well nigh led meinto the heresy of thinking thee no daughterof mine ah my beloved companion who artnow far from the sorrows and cares of this wearyworld could'st thou have thought that the daughterthou didst clasp to thy bosom would like thewicked wife of job become a temptress to her fatherin the hour of affliction and recommend tohim to make his conscience truckle to his interestand to beg back at the bloody hands of his master'sand perhaps his son's murderers a wretchedremnant of his property he has been robbed of why wench if i must beg think'st thou i willsue to those who have made me a mendicant nai will never show my grey beard worn in sorrowfor my sovereign's death to move the compassionof some proud sequestrator who perhaps was oneof the parricides no if henry lde must suewoodstock for food it shall be of some sound loyalist likehimself who having but half a loaf remaining willnot nevertheless refuse to share it with him forhis daughter she may wander her own waywhich leads her to a refuge with her wealthyroundhead kinsfolk but let her no more callhim father whose honest indigence she has refusedto share you do me injustice sir answered theyoung lady with a voice animated yet faltering cruel injustice god knows your way is myway though it lead to ruin and beggary andwhile you tread it my arm shall support you whileyou will accept an aid so feeble thou worst me girl answered the oldcavalier thou worst me as will shakspearesays thou speaks of lending me thy arm butthy secret thought is thyself to hang upon markhameverard'smy father my father answered alice in atone of deep grief what can thus have alteredyour clear judgment

upbraid mewith markham everard have i seen or spokewith him since you discharged him my companywith terms less kind i will speak it truly thanwas due even to the relationship betwixt you why think i

consider as being at the bottom of everythingwhich moves for the king in these parts it is true wench replied the knight andsmall cause would make the villains sequestratethe poor remains which the civil wars have left to woodstockthe colleges that and the risk of my poor fellows well thou hast disarmed me girl iwill be as patient and calm as a martyrpray god you keep your word sir repliedhis daughter but you are ever so much movedat the sight of any of these men that would you make a child of me alice said sir henry why know you not that ican look upon a viper or a toad or a bunch ofengendering adders without any worse feelingthan a little disgust and though a roundheadand especially a redcoat are in my opinion morepoisonous than vipers more loathsome than toadsmore hateful than knotted adders yet can i overcomemy nature so far that should one of themappear at this moment thyself should see howcivilly i would entreat himas he spoke the military preacher abandonedhis leafy screen and stalking forward stood unexpectedlybefore the old cavalier who stared athim as if he had thought that his expressions hadactually raised a devilwho art thou at length said sir henryin a raised and angry voice while his daughterwoodstock clung to this arm in terror little confident thather father's pacific resolutions would abide theshock of this unwelcome apparitioni am ones

commissionersman the soldier with little courtesy held out ascroll which sir henry took from him betwixthis finger and thumb as if it were a letter from apesthouse and held it at as much distance fromhis eyes as his purpose of reading it would permithe then read aloud and as he named theparties one by one he added a short commentaryon each name addressed indeed to alice but invol i d

unbecomingfashion and albeit i know that you malignantwoodstock think you have a right to make free with thatdamnation which you seem to use as your ownportion yet it is superfluous to invoke it againstothers who have better hopes in their thoughtsand better words in their mouthsthou art but a canting varlet replied theknight and yet thou art right in some sense for it is superfluous to curse men who already aredamned as black as the smoke of hell itselfi prithee forbear continued the soldierfor manners sake if not for conscience grislyoaths suit ill with gray beardsnay that is truth if the devil spoke it saidthe knight and i thank heaven i can followgood counsel though old nick gives it and sofriend touching these same commissioners bearthem this message that sir henry lee is keeperof woodstock park with right of waif and strayvert and venison as complete as any of them haveto their estate that is if they possess any estatebut what they have gained by plundering honestmen nevertheless he will give place to thosewho have made their might their right and will woodstocknot expose the lives of good and true men wherethe odds are so much against them and heprotests that he makes this surrender neither asacknowledging of these so termed commissionersnor as for his own individual part fearing theirforce but purely to avoid the loss of englishblood of which so much hath been spilt in theselate timesit is well spoken said the steward of thecommissioners and therefore i pray you letus walk together into the house that thou may'stdeliver up unto me the vessels and gold and silverornaments belonging unto the egyptian pharaohwho committed them to thy keeping what vessels exclaimed the fiery oldknight and belonging to whom unbaptizeddog speak civil of the martyr in my

his long tuck stood upon his guardthe swords clashed smartly together while alicein her terror screamed wildly for assistance butthe combat was of short duration the old woodstockcavalier had attacked a man as cunning of fence ashehimself or a little more so and possessing allthe strength and activity of which time had deprivedsir henry and the calmness which theother had lost in his passion they had scarceexchanged three passes ere the sword of theknight flew up in the air as if it had gone insearch of the scabbard and burning with shameand anger sir henry stood disarmed at themercy of his antagonist the republican showedno purpose of abusing his victory nor did heeither during the combat or after the victory waswon in any respect alter the sour and grave composurewhich reigned upon his countenance acombat of life and death seemed to him a thingas familiar and as little to be feared as an ordinarybout with foilsthou art delivered unto my hands he saidand by the law of arms i might

design to discoverwhether there was fair play in his mind or nothe then applied his five fingers to scratch a largeshock head of hair as if that operation wasnecessary to enable hit to come to a conclusionthis is all fair sounding brother said he buti tell you plainly there are some silver mugs andplatters and flagons and so forth in yonder housewhich have survived the general sweep that sentall our plate to the smeltingpot to put our knight'stroop on horseback now if thou takes not theseoff my hand i may come to trouble since it maybethought i have finished their numbers whereas i being as honest a fellow as ever stole venison said tomkins nayi do owe thee an interruptionwoodstockgo to then replied the keeper if a stagmay have come to mischance in my walk it wasno way in the course of dishonesty but merelyto keep my old dame's pan from rusting butfor silver porringers tankards and such like iwould as soon have drunk the melted silver asstolen the vessel made out of it so that i wouldnot wish blame or suspicion fell on me in thismatter and therefore if you will have thethings rendered even now why so and if nothold me blameless'ay truly said tomkins and who is tohold me blameless if they should see cause tothink anything finished not the right worshipfulcommissioners to whom the property of theestate is as their own therefore as thou say'stwe must walk warily in the matter to lock upthe house and leave it were but the work ofsimple ones what mayest thou to spend thenight there and then nothing can be touchedwithout the knowledge of us both why concerning that answered the keeper i should be at my hut to make mattervol i e woodstocksomewhat conformable for him and mistressalice for my old dame joan is somethingdunny and will scarce know how to manage and yet to speak truth by the mass i wouldrather not see sir henry tonight since what haslapped today hath roused his spleen and it isa pera venture he may have met something atthe hut which will scarce tend to cool itit is a pity said tomkins that being agentleman of such grave and goodly presencehe should be such a malignant cavalier and thathe should like the rest of that generation ofvipers have clothed himself with curses as witha garment which is as much as to say the tough oldknight hath a habit of swearing said the keepergrinning at a pun which has been repeatedsince his time but who can

sycamoresone of which as king of the forest stood a littledetached from the rest as if scorning the vicinityof any rival it was scathed and gnarledin the branches but the immense trunk stillshowed to what gigantic size the monarch of theforest can attain in the groves of merry englandthat is called the king's oak said joceline the oldest men of woodstock know nothow old it is they say henry used to sit underwoodstock it with fair rosamond and see the lasses danceand the lads of the village run races and wrestlefor belts or bonnetsi nothing doubt it friend said tomkins a tyrant and a harlot

twistedlike a wasted briarrod the green too usedto be closeshaved and rolled till it was smoothas a velvet mantle now it is rough and overgrownwell well friend joceline said the independent but where was the edification of allthis what use of doctrine could be derivedfrom a pipe and tabor or was there ever aughtlike wisdom in a bagpipe woodstock you may ask better scholars that saidjoceline but methinks men cannot be alwaysgrave and with the hat over their brow a youngmaiden will laugh as a tender flower will blow ay and a lad will ike her the better for it justas the same blithe spring that makes the youngbirds whistle bids the blithe fawns skip therehave come worse days since the jolly old timeshave gone by i tell thee that in the holidayswhich you mr longford have put down ihave seen this greensward alive with merry maidensand manly fellows the good old rector himselfthought it was no sin to come for a whileand look on and his goodly cassock and scarfkept us all in good order and taught us to limitour mirth within the bounds of discretion wemight it may be crack a broad jest or pledgea friendly cup a turn too often but it was inmirth and good neighbourhood ay and if therewas a bout at singlestick or a bellyful of boxingit was all for love and kindness and bettera few dry blows in drink than the bloody doingswe have had in sober earnest since the presbywoodstock ter's cap got above the bishop's mitre and weexchanged our goodly rectors and learned doctorswhose sermons were all bolstered up withas much greek and latin as might have confoundedthe devil himself for weavers and cobblersand such other pulpit volunteers as aswe heard this morning it will outwell friend said the independent withpatience scarce to have been expected i quarrelnot with thee for nauseating my doctrine ifthine ear is so much tickled with tabor tunes andmorris tripping truly it is not likely thou should'stfind pleasant savour in more wholesome and soberfood but let us to the lodge that we may goabout our business there before the sun sets troth and that may be advisable for morereasons than one said the keeper for therehave been tales about the lodge which have mademen afeard to harbour there after nightfallwere not yon old knight and yonder damselhis daughter wont to dwell there said theindependent my information said soay truly did they said eocene and woodstockwhen they kept a jolly household all went wellenough for nothing banishes fear uke good alebut after the best of our men went to the warsand were slain at naseby flight they who wereleft found the lodge more lonesome and the oldknight has been much deserted of his servants marry it might be that he has lacked silverof late to pay groom and lackey a potential reason for the diminution of ahousehold said the soldierright sir even so replied the keeperthey spoke of steps in the great gallery heardby dead of the night and voices that whisperedat noon in the matted chambers and the servantspretended that these things scared themaway but in my poor judgment when martinmasand whitsuntide came round without a the old bluebottles of servingmen beganto think of creeping elsewhere before the frostchilled them no devil so frightful as that whichdances in the pocket where there is no cross tokeep him outyou were reduced then to a petty household said the independentwoodstock ay marry were we said joceline butwe kept some halfscore together what with bluebottlesin the lodge what with green caterpillarsof the chase like him who is yours to command we stuck together till we found a call totake a morning's ride somewhere or other to the town of worcester said the soldierwhere you were crushed like vermin and palmerworms as you areyou may say your pleasure replied thekeeper i'll never contradict a man who hasgot my head under his belt our backs are atthe wall or you would not be herenay friend said the independent thourises nothing by thy freedom and trust in mei can be hon camarado to a good soldier althoughi have striven with him even to the going down ofthe sun but here we are in front of the lodgethey stood accordingly in front of the oldgothic building irregularly constructed and atdifferent times as the humour of the englishmonarchs led them to taste the pleasures of woodstockchase and to make such improvements forff woodstocktheir own accommodation as the increasing luxuryof each age required the oldest part of thestructure had been named by tradition fair rosamond'stower it was a small turret of greatheight with narrow windows and walls of massivethickness the tower had no opening tothe ground or means of descending a great partof the lower portion being solid masonwork itwas traditionally said to have been accessible onlyby a sort of small drawbridge which might bedropped at pleasure from a little portal near thesummit of the turret to the battlements of anothertower of the same construction but twenty feetlower and containing only a winding staircasecalled in woodstock love's ladder because itis said that by ascending this staircase to thetop of the tower and then making use of thedrawbridge henry obtained access to the chamberof his paramourthis tradition had been keenly impugned bydr rochecliffe the former rector of woodstockwho insisted that what was called rosamond'stower was merely an interior keep or citadel towoodstock which the lord or warden of the castle might retreatwhen other points of safety failed him andeither protract his defence or at the worst stipulatefor reasonable terms of surrender the peopleof woodstock jealous of their ancient traditionsdid not relish this new mode of explainingthem away and it is even said that the mayorwhom we have already introduced became presbyterianin revenge of the doubts cast by therector upon this important subject rather choosingto give up the liturgy than his fixed beliefin rosamond's tower and love's ladderthe rest of the lodge was of considerable extentand of different ages comprehending a nestof little courts surrounded by buildings whichcorresponded with each other sometimes withindoorssometimes by crossing the courts and frequentlyin both ways the different heights ofthe building announced that they could only beconnected by the usual variety of staircases whichexercised the limbs of our ancestors in the sixteenthand earlier centuries and seem sometimesto have been contrived for no other purpose woodstockthe varied and multiplied fronts of this irregularbuilding were as dr rochecliffe was wont tosay an absolute banquet to the architectural antiquaryas they certainly contained specimens ofevery style which existed from the pure normanof henry of anjou down to the composite halfgothic half classical architecture of elizabethand her successor accordingly the rector washimself as much enamoured of woodstock asever was henry of fair rosamond and as hisintimacy with sir henry lee permitted him entranceat all times to the royal lodge he usedto spend whole days in wandering about the antiqueapartments examining measuring studyingand finding out excellent reasons for architecturalpeculiarities which probably only owedtheir existence to the freakish fancy of a gothicartist but the old antiquarian had been expelledfrom his living by the intolerance and troublesof the times and his successor nehemiah holdenoughwould have considered an elaborate investigationof the profane sculpture and architectureof blinded and bloodthirsty papists togewoodstockther with the history of the dissolute amours ofold norman monarchs as httle better than abowing down before the calves of bethel and adrinking of the cup of abominations we returnto the course of our storythere is said the independent tomkinsafter he had carefully perused the front of thebuilding many a rare monument of oldenwickedness about this miscalled royal lodge verily i shall rejoice much to see the same destroyedyea burned to ashes and the ashesthrown into the brook kedron or any otherbrook that the land may be cleansed from thememory thereof neither remember the iniquitywith which their fathers have sinnedthe keeper heard him with secret indignationand began to consider with himself whether asthey stood but one to one and without chance ofspeedy interference he was not called upon byhis official duty to castigate the rebel who usedlanguage so defamatory but he fortunately recollectedthat the strife must be a doubtful onethat the advantage of arms was against him to woodstockand that in especial even if he should succeedin the combat it would be at the risk of severeretaliation it must be owned too that therewas something about the independent so darkand mysterious so grim and grave that the moreopen spirit of the keeper felt oppressed and ifnot overawed at least kept in doubt concerninghim and he thought it wisest as well as safestfor his master and himself to avoid all subjectsof dispute and know better with whom he wasdealing before he made either friend or enemyof himthe great gate of the lodge was strongly boltedbut the wicket opened on joceline's raisingthe latch there was a short passage of ten feetwhich had been formerly closed by a portcullisat the inner end while three loopholes opened oneither side through which any daring intrudermight be annoyed who having surprised thefirst gate must be thus exposed to a severe firebefore he could force the second but the machineryof the portcullis was damaged and itnow remained a fixture brandishing its jaw wellwoodstock furnished with iron fangs but incapable of droppingit across the path of invasionthe way therefore lay open to the greathall or outer vestibule of the lodge one endof this long and dusky apartment was entirelyoccupied by a gallery which had in ancient timesserved to accommodate the musicians and minstrelsthere was a clumsy staircase at either sideof it composed of entire logs of a foot square and in each angle of the ascent was placed bywayof sentinel the figure of a norman footsoldierhaving an open casque on his head whichdisplayed features as stern as the painter's geniuscould devise their arms were buffjackets orshirts of mail round bucklers with spikes in thecentre and buskins which adorned and defendedthe feet and ancles but left the knees bare thesewooden warders held great swords or maces intheir hands like military guards on duty manyan empty hook and brace along the walls of thegloomy apartment marked the spots from whicharms long preserved as trophies had been in thepressure of the war once more taken down to dou woodstockservice in the field like veterans whom extremityof danger recalls to battle on other rustyfastenings were still displayed the hunting trophiesof the monarchs to whom the lodge belongedand of the sylvan knights to whose careit had been from time to time confidedat the nether end of the hall a huge heavystonewrought chimneypiece projected itself tenfeet from the wall adorned with many a cypherand many a scutcheon of the royal house ofengland in its present state it yawned like thearched mouth of a funeral vault or perhapsmight be compared to the crater of an extinguishedvolcano but the sable complexion ofthe massive stonework and all around it showedthat the time had been when it sent its huge firesblazing up the huge chimney besides puffingmany a volume of smoke over the heads of thejovial guests whose royalty or nobility did notrender them sensitive enough to quarrel withsuch slight inconvenience on these occasions itwas the tradition of the house that two cartloadsof wood was the regular allowance for the firewoodstock between noon and curfew and the andirons ordogs as they were termed constructed for retainingthe blazing fire wood on the hearth werewrought in the shape of lions of such gigantic sizemight well warrant the legend there were longseats of stone within the chimney where in despiteof the tremendous heat monarchs were sometimessaid to have taken their station and amused themselveswith broiling the tumbles or dowsets of thedeer upon the glowing embers with their

more briefly thanwe have detailed them to the reader the independentseemed to listen with some interest atfirst but flinging it suddenly aside he said inasolemn tone perish babylon as thy masternebuchadnezzar hath perished he is a wandererand thou shalt be a waste place yea and awilderness yea a desert of salt in which thereshall be thirst and famines there is like to be enough of both tbnightssaid joceline unless the good knights larderbe somewhat fuller than it is wont we must care for the creaturecomfortssaid the independent but in due season whenwoodstock our duties are done whither lead these entrancesthat to the right replied the keeper leadsto what are called the stateapartments not usedsince the year sixteen hundred and thirtyninewhen his blessed majesty how sir interrupted the independent inavoice of thunder doest thou speak of charlesstuart as blessing or blessed beware the proclamationto that effecti meant no harm answered the keepersuppressing his disposition to make a harsher reply my business is with bolts and bucks notwith titles and state affairs but yet whatevermay have lapped since that poor king was followedwith blessings enough from woodstockfor he left a glove full of broad pieces for thepoor of the place peace friend said the independent iwill think thee else one of those besotted andblinded papists who hold that bestowing of almsis an atonement and washing away of the wrongsand oppressions which have been wrought by woodstock the almsgiver thou mayest then these were theapartments of charles stuart and of his father james before him andelizabeth before him and bluff king henrywho builded that wing before them alland there i suppose the knight and hisdaughter dwelt no replied joceline sir henry leehad too much reverence for for things whichare now thought worth no reverence at all besidesthe staterooms are unaired and in indifferentorder since of hate years the knight ranger'sapartment lies by that passage to the leftand whither goes yonder stair which seemsboth to lead upwards and downwards upwards replied the keeper it leads tomany apartments used for various purposes ofsleeping and other accommodation downwardsto the kitchen offices and vaults of the castlewhich at this time of the evening you cannotsee without lightswe will to the apartments of your knightthence said the independent is there fittingaccommodation there woodstock ssuch as has served a person of conditionwhose lodging is now worse appointed answeredthe honest keeper his bile rising so fast that headded in a muttering and inaudible tone so itmay well serve a cropeared knave like theehe acted as the usher however and led ontowards the ranger's apartmentsthis suite opened by a short passage from thehall secured at time of need by two oaken doorswhich could be fastened by large bars of the samethat were drawn out of the wall and enteredinto square holes contrived for their receptionon the other side of the portal at the end ofthis passage a small anteroom received theminto which opened the sittingapartment of thegood knight which in the style of the timesmight have been termed a fair summer parlour lighted by two oriel windows so placed as to commandeach of them a separate avenue leadingdistant and deep down into the forest the principalornament of the apartment besides two orthree family portraits of less interest was a tallfulllength picture which hung above the chimewhich like that in the hall was of woodstockheavy stonework ornamented with carved scutcheonsemblazoned with various devices theportrait was that of a man about fifty years ofage in complete plate armour and painted inthe harsh and dry manner of holbein probablyindeed the work of that artist as the dates correspondedthe formal and marked anglespoints and projections of the armour were agood subject for the harsh pencil of that earlyschool the face of the knight was from thefading of the colours pale and dim like that ofsome being from the other world yet the linesexpressed forcibly pride and exultation hepointed with his leadingstaff or truncheon to thebackground where in such perspective as theartist possessed were depicted the remains of aburning church or monastery and four or fivesoldiers in red cassocks bearing away in triumphwhat seemed a brazen font or laver above theirheads might be traced in scroll lee victor sicvoluit right opposite to the picture hung inaniche in the wall a complete set of tilting armourthe black and gold colours and ornamentswoodstock of which exactly corresponded with those exhibitedin the portraitthe picture was one of those which fromsomething marked in the features and expressionattract the observation even of those whoare ignorant of art the independent lookedat it until a smile passed transiently over hisclouded brow whether he smiled to see thegrim old cavalier employed in desecrating a religioushouse an occupation much conformingto the practice of his own sect whether he smiledin contempt of the old painter's harsh anddry mode of working or whether the sight ofthis remarkable portrait revived some other ideasthe underkeeper could not decidethe smile passed away in an instant as thesoldier looked to the oriel windows the recesseswithin them were raised a step or two from thewall in one was placed a walnuttree readingdeskand a huge stuffed armchair covered withspanish leather a little cabinet stood besidewith some of its shuttles and drawers open displayinghawksbells dogwhistles instruments fortrimming a falcon's feathers bridlebits of various woodstockconstructions and other trifles connected withsylvan sportthe other little recess was differently furnishedthere lay some articles of needlework on asmall table besides a lute with a book havingsome airs pricked down in it and a frame forworking embroidery some tapestry was displayedaround the recess with more attention to ornamentthan was visible in the rest of the apartment the arrangement of a few bowpots with suchflowers as the fading season afforded showedalso the superintendence of female tastetomkins cast an eye of careless regard uponthese subjects of female occupation then steppedinto the farther window and began to turn theleaves of a folio which lay open on the readingdeskapparently with some interest jocelinewho had determined to watch his motions withoutinterfering with them was standing at somedistance in dejected silence when a door behindthe tapestry suddenly opened and a pretty villagemaid tripped out with a napkin in her handas if she had been about some household dutyhow now sir impudence she said towoodstock joceline in a smart tone what do you hereprowling about the apartments when the masteris not at home but instead of the answer which perhaps sheexpected joceline joliffe cast a mournful glancetowards the soldier in the oriel window as if tomake what he said fully intelligible and repliedwith a dejected appearance and voice alackmy pretty phoebe there come those here thathave more right or might than any of us andwill use little ceremony in coming when they willand staying while they pleasehe darted another glance at tom king whostill seemed busy with the book before him thensidled close to the astonished girl who had continuedlooking alternately at the keeper and atthe stranger as if she had been unable to

expression offright in her countenance which she had hithertoaverted in rural coquetryas sure my dearest phoebe as the rest of the asseveration was lost in phcebesear so closely did the keeper's lips approach it and if they approached so very near as to touchher cheek grief like impatience hath its privilegesand poor phoebe had enough of seriousalarm to prevent her from demurring upon sucha triflebut no trifle was the approach of joceline'swoodstock lips to phoebe's pretty though sunburnt cheekin the estimation of the independent who a utthebefore the object of joceliiie's vigilance hadbeen in his turn the observer of the keeper'sdemeanour so soon as the interview betwixtphoebe and him had become so interesting andwhen he remarked the closeness of joceline's argumenthe raised his voice to a pitch of harshnessthat would have rivalled that of a saw andwhich at once made joceline and phoebe springsix feet apart each in contrary directions andif cupid was of the party must have

delay he pressed the doorat once with foot and hand in a way which thefrail barrier was unable to resist it gave way accordinglyand the knight thus forcibly enteredthe kitchen or outward apartment of his servantin the midst of the floor and with a posturewhich indicated embarrassment stood a youthfulstranger in a ridingsuit this may be my last act of authority heresaid the knight seizing the

anxiety tomake a sign to her cousin to break off the interviewand to retire since her father commanded hisabsence in a manner so peremptory unhappilyshe was observed by sir henry who concludingthat what he saw was evidence of a private understandingbetwixt the cousins his wrath acquirednew fuel and it required the utmost exertionof selfcommand and recollection of all that wasdue to his own

farther opposition for it was well knownthat desborough himself only held his consequenceas a kinsman of cromwell and the lordgeneral who was well nigh paramount alreadywas known to be strongly favourable both to theelder and younger everard it is true they werepresbyterians and he an independent and thatthough sharing those feelings of correct moralityand more devoted religious feeling by whichwith few exceptions the parliamentarian partywere distinguished the everardss were not disposedto carry these attributes to the extreme of enthusiasmpractised by so many others at the timeyet it was well known that whatever might becromwell's own religious creed he was not uniformlybounded by it in the choice of his favouritesbut extended his countenance to those whocould serve him even although according to thewoodstock phrase of the time they came out of the darknessof egypt the character of the elder everardstood very high for wisdom and sagacity besidesbeing of a good family and competent fortunehis adherence would lend a dignity to any sidehe might espouse then his son had been a distinguishedand successful soldier remarkable forthe discipline he maintained among his men thebravery which he showed in the time of actionand the humanity with which he was always readyto qualify the consequences of victory suchmen were not to be neglected when many signscombined to show that the parties in the statewho had successfully accomplished the depositionand death of the king were speedily to quarrelamong themselves about the division of the spoilsthe two everardss were therefore much courtedby cromwell and their influence with him supposedto be so great that trusty mr secretarytomkins cared not to expose himself to risk bycontending with colonel everard for such a trifleas a night's lodgingjoceline was active on his side more lightswere obtained more wood thrown on the fire vol i k woodstockand the two newlyarrived strangers were introducedinto victor lee's parlour as it was calledfrom the picture over the chimneypiece whichwe have already described it was several minutesere colonel everard could recover his generalstoicism of deportment so strongly he wasimpressed by finding himself in the apartmentunder whose roof he had passed so many of thehappiest hours of his life there was the cabinetwhich he had seen opened with such feelingsof delight when

theapartment the searching eye of the old warriorseemed always bent upon his in whatever partof the room he placed himself and how his childishimagination was perturbed at a phenomenonfor which he could not accountwoodstock with these came a thousand more dear andwarmer recollections of his early attachment tohis pretty cousin alice when he aided at herlessons brought water for her flowers or accompaniedher while she sung and he rememberedthat while her father looked at them with a goodhumouredand careless smile he had once heardhim mutter and if it should turn out so whyit might be best for both and the theories ofhappiness he had reared on these words allthese visions had been dispelled by the trumpetof war which called sir henry lee and himselfto opposite sides and the transactions of this veryday had shown that even everard's success as asoldier and a statesman seemed absolutely to prohibitthe chance of their being revivedhe was waked out of this unpleasing reverieby the approach of joceline who being possiblya seasoned toper had made the additional arrangementswith more expedition and accuracythan could have been expected from a personengaged as he had been since

mindherbertcolonel everard experienced the truth containedin the verses of the quaint old bard whomwe have quoted above amid private grief andanxiety for a country long a prey to civil warand not likely to fall soon under any fixed or wellestablishedform of government everard and hisfather had like many others turned their eyes togeneral cromwell as the person whose valourhad made him the darling of the army whosestrong sagacity had hitherto predominated overthe high talents by which he had been assailedwoodstock in parliament as well as over his enemies in thefield and who was alone in the situation to settlethe station as the phrase then went or in otherwords to dictate the mode of government thefather and son were both reputed to stand highin the general's favour but markham everardwas conscious of some particulars which inducedhim to doubt whether cromwell actuallyand at heart bore either to his father or to himselfthat goodwill which was generally believedhe knew him for a profound politician whocould veil for any length of time his real sentimentsof men and things until they could be displayedwithout prejudice to his interest and hemoreover knew that the general was not likelyto forget the opposition which the presbyterianparty had offered to what oliver called the greatmatter the trial namely and execution of theking in this opposition his father and he hadanxiously concurred nor had the arguments noreven the halfexpressed threats of cromwell inducedthem to flinch from that course far lessto permit their names to be introduced into thecommission nominated to sit in judgment on thatmemorable occasion woodstockthis hesitation had occasioned some temporarycoldness between the general and the everardfather and son but as the latter remainedin the army and bore arms under cromwell bothin scotland and finally at worcester his servicesvery frequently called forth the approbationof his commander after the fight of worcesterin particular he was among the number of thoseofficers on whom oliver rather considering theactual and practical extent of his own power thanthe name under which he exercised it was withdifficulty withheld from imposing the dignity ofknights bannerets at his own will and pleasureit therefore seemed that all recollection of formerdisagreement was obliterated and that theeverardss had regained their former strongholdin the general's affections there were indeedseveral who doubted this and who endeavouredto bring over this distinguished young officer tosome other of the parties which divided the infantcommonwealth but to these proposals heturned a deaf ear enough of blood he said hadbeen spilled it was time that the nation shouldhave repose under a firmlyestablished governwoodstock ment of strength sufficient to protect propertyand of lenity enough to encourage the return oftranquillity this he thought could only beaccomplished by means of cromwell and thegreater part of england was of the same opinionit was ti'ue that in thus submitting to the dominationof a successful soldier those who did soforgot the principles upon which they had drawnthe sword against the late king but in revolutionsstern and high principles are often obliged togive way to the current of existing circumstances and in many a case where wars have been wagedfor points of metaphysical right they have beenat last gladly terminated upon the mere hope ofobtaining general tranquillity as after many along siege a garrison is often glad to submit onmere security for life and limbcolonel everard therefore felt that the supportwhich he afforded cromwell was only underthe idea that amid a choice of evils the leastwas likely to ensue from a man of the general'swisdom and valour being placed at the head ofthe state and he was sensible that oliver himselfwas likely to consider his attachment as luke'swoodstockwarm and imperfect and measure his gratitudefor it upon the same limited scalein the meanwhile however circumstancescompelled him to make trial of the generalsfriendship the sequestration of woodstock andthe warrant to the commissioners to dispose of itas national property had been long granted butthe interest of the elder everard had for weeksand months deferred its execution the hourwas now approaching when the blow could be nolonger parried especially as sir henry lee onhis side resisted every proposal of submittinghimself to the existing government and wastherefore now that his hour of grace was passedenrolled in the list of stubborn and irreclaimablemalignant with whom the council of state wasdetermined no longer to keep terms the onlymode of protecting the old knight and his daughterwas to interest if possible the general himselfin the matter and revolving all the circumstancesconnected with their intercourse colonel everardfelt that a request which would so immediatelyinterfere with the interests of desborough thebrotherinlaw of cromwell and one of the prewoodstocksent commissioners was putting to a very severetrial the friendship of the latter yet no alternativeremainedwith this view and agreeably to a requestfrom cromwell who at parting had been veryurgent to have his written opinion upon publicaffairs colonel everard passed the earlier partof the night in arranging his ideas upon the stateof the commonwealth in a plan which he thoughtlikely to be acceptable to cromwell as it exhortedhim under the aid of providence to become thesaviour of the state by convoking a free parliamentand by their aid placing himself at the headof some form of liberal and established governmentwhich might supersede the estate of anarchyin which the nation was otherwise likely to bemerged taking a general view of the totally brokencondition of the royalists and of the variousfactions which now convulsed the state he showedhow this might be done without bloodshed orviolence from this topic he descended to thepropriety of keeping up the becoming state of theexecutive government in whose hands soever itshould be lodged and thus showed cromwell asthe future stadtholder or consul or lieutenantswoodstockgeneral of great britain and ireland a prospectof

woodstock and interceded for thepreservation of that beautiful seat as a matter ofpersonal favour in which he found himself deeplyinterestedcolonel everard when he had finished his letterdid not find himself greatly risen in his ownopinion in the course of his political conducthe had till this hour avoided mixing up personalmotives with his public grounds of action andyet he now felt himself making such a compositionbut he comforted himself or at least silencedthis unpleasing recollection with the considerationthat the weal of britain studied under theaspect of the times absolutely required thatcromwell should be at the head of the government and that the interest of sir henry lee orrather his safety and his existence no less emphaticallydemanded the preservation of woodstockand his residence there was it a fault of his thatwoods to c the same road should lead to both these ends oithat his private interest and that of the countryshould happen to mix in the same letter hehardened himself therefore to the act made upand addressed his packet to the lord general andthen sealed it with his seal of arms this done helay back in his chair and in spite of his expectationsto the contrary fell asleep in the courseof his reflections anxious and harassing as theywere and did not awaken until the cold grey lightof dawn was peeping through the eastern orielhe started at first

extinguishedin its own white embers the gloomypicture over the chimneypiece the sealed packeton the table all reminded him of the events ofyesterday and his deliberations of the succeedingnightthere

natural proneness of power to renderitself arbitrary if he govern by parliamentsand with regard to the privileges of the subjectwherefore not oliver as well as charles but imust take measures for

be sunkin the extravagant license which was practisedby the cavaliers as if to oppose their conduct inevery point to the preciseness of their enemies woodstockyet wildrake wellborn and welleducated andendowed with good natural parts and a heartwhich even debauchery and the wild life of aroaring cavalier had not been able entirely tocorrupt moved on his present embassy with astrange mixture of feelings such as perhaps hehad never in his life before experiencedhis feelings as a royalist led him to detest cromwellwhom in other circumstances he would scarcehave wished to see except in a field of battlewhere he could have had the pleasure to exchangepistolshots with him but with this hatred therewas mixed a certain degree of fear always victoriouswherever he fought the remarkable personwhom wildrake was now approaching hadacquired that influence over the minds of his enemieswhich constant success is so apt to inspirethey dreaded while they hated him and joinedto these feelings was a restless meddling curiositywhich made a particular feature in wildrakescharacter who having long had little businessof his own and caring nothing about thatwhich he had was easily attracted by the desirewoodstock of seeing whatever was curious or interestingaround himi should like to see the old rascal after allhe said were it but to say that i had seen himhe reached windsor in the

eight o'clock for the trouble ofpresenting himself at the castlegate and announcinghimself as the bearer of dispatches to hisexcellencyto the castle the disguised cavalier repairedat the hour appointed admittance was freelypermitted to him by the redcoated soldier whowith austere looks and his musket on his shouldermounted guard at the external gate of thatnoble building wildrake passed through theunder ward or court gazing as he passed uponthe beautiful chapel which had but lately receivedin darkness and silence the unhonouredremains of the slaughtered king of englandrough as wildrake was the recollection ofthis circumstance affected him so strongly thatlie had nearly turned back in a sort of horrorwoodstock rather than face the dark and daring man towhom amongst all the actors in that melancholyaffairits tragic conclusion was chiefly to be imputedbut he felt the necessity of subduing allsentiments of this nature and compelled himselfto proceed in a negotiation intrusted to his conductby one to whom he was so much obliged as coloneleverard at the ascent which passed by theround tower he looked to the ensignstaff fromwhich the banner of england was wont to floatit was gone with all its rich emblazonry its gorgeousquarterings and splendid embroidery andin its room waved that of the commonwealththe cross of saint george in its colours of blueand red not yet intersected by the diagonal crossof scotland which was soon after assumed inevidence of england's conquest over her ancientenemy this change of ensigns increased the trainof his gloomy reflections in which although contraryto his wont he became so deeply wrappedthat the first thing which recalled him to himselfwas the challenge from the sentinel accompaniedwith a stroke of the butt of his musket on the woodstockpavement with an emphasis which made wildrakestartwhither away and who are youthe bearer of a packet answered wildraketo the worshipful the lord general stand till i call the officer of the guardthe corporal made his appearance distinguishedabove those of his command by a doublequantity of band round his neck a doubleheight of steeplecrowned hat a larger allowanceof cloak and a treble proportion of sour gravityof aspect it might be read on his countenancethat he was one of those tremendous enthusiaststo whom oliver owed his conquests whose religiouszeal made them even more than a match forthe highspirited and highborn cavaliers whoexhausted their valour in vain in defence of theirsovereign's person and crown he looked withgrave solemnity at wildrake as if he was makingin his own mind an inventory of his features anddress and having fully perused them he required to know his businessmy business said wildrake as firmly as hecould for the close investigation of this man hadwoodstock given him some unpleasant nervous sensations ray business is with your generalwith his excellency the lord general thouwould'st say replied the corporal thyspeech my friend savours too little of the reverencedue to his excellency d n his excellency was at the lips of thecavalier but prudence kept guard and permittednot the offensive words to escape the barrier heonly bowed and was silent follow me said the starched figure whomhe addressed and wildrake followed him accordinglyinto the guardhouse which exhibited aninterior characteristic of the times and very differentfrom what such military stations presentat the present dayby the fire sat two or three musketeers listeningto one who was expounding some religious mysteryto them he began half beneath his breathbut in tones of great volubility which tones as heapproached the conclusion became sharp and eageras challenging either instant answer or silentacquiescence the audience seemed to listen tothe speaker with immovable features only answeringhim with clouds of tobaccosmoke which woodstockthey rolled from under their thick mustachios ona bench lay a soldier on his face whether asleepor in a hit

in drilling a stout bumpkinlately enlisted to the manual as it was thenused the motions and words of command weretwenty at the very least and until they wereregularly brought to an end the corporal

smile of the speaker accompanied thispoor attempt at a pun and then turning roundto the corporal who stood two paces off with theface of one who seemed desirous of speakingsaid how now corporal what tidings here is one with a packet and please yourexcellency said the corporal surely myspirit does not rejoice in him seeing i esteem himas a wolf in sheep's clothingby these words wildrake learned that he wasin the actual presence of the remarkable personto whom he was commissioned and he pausedto consider in what manner he ought to addresshimthe figure of oliver cromwell was as is generallyknown in no way prepossessing hewas of middle stature strong and coarsely madewith harsh and severe features indicative how woodstockever of much natural sagacity and depth ofthought his eyes were grey and piercing hisnose too large in proportion to his other featureshis manner of speaking when he had the purposeto make himself distinctly understood wasenergetic and forcible though neither gracefulnor eloquent no man could on such occasionput his meaning into fewer and more decisivewords but when as it often happened he hada mind to play the orator for the benefit of peoplesears without enlightening their understandingcromwell was wont to invest his meaning orthat which seemed to be his meaning in such amist of words surrounding it with so many exclusionsand exceptions and fortifying it with such alabyrinth of parentheses that though one of themost shrewd men in england he was perhapstho most unintelligible speaker that ever perplexedan audience it has been long since said bythe historian that a collection of the protector'sspeeches would make with a few exceptions themost nonsensical book in the world but he oughtto have added that nothing could be more nervousconcise and intelligible than what he reallyintended should be understoodwoodstock it was also remarked of cromwell that thoughborn of a good family both by father and motherand although he had the usual opportunities ofeducation and breeding connected with such anadvantage the fanatic democratic ruler couldnever acquire or else disdained to practise thecourtesies usually exercised among the higherclasses in their intercourse with each other hisdemeanour was so blunt as sometimes might betermed clownish yet there was in his languageand manner a force and energy corresponding tohis character which impressed awe if it did notimpose respect and there were even times whenthat dark and subtle spirit expanded itself so asalmost to conciliate affection the turn for humourwhich displayed itself by fits was broadand of a low and sometimes practical charactersomething there was in his disposition congenialto that of his countrymen a contempt of folly ahatred of affectation and a dislike of ceremonywhich joined to the strong intrinsic qualities ofsense and courage made him in many respectsnot an unfit representative of the democracy ofenglandhis religion must always be a subject of much woodstockdoubt and probably of doubt which he himselfcould hardly have cleared up unquestionablythere was a time in his life when he was sincerelyenthusiastic and when his natural temper slightlysubject to hypochondria was strongly agitatedby the same fanaticism which influenced somany persons of the time on the other handthere were periods during his political careerwhen we certainly do him no injustice in charginghim with hypocritical affectation we shallprobably judge him and others of the same agemost truly if we suppose that their religiousprofessions were partly influential in their ownbreast partly assumed in compliance with theirown interest and so ingenious is the humanheart in deceiving itself as well as others that itis probable neither cromwell himself nor thosemaking similar pretensions to distinguished pietycould exactly have fixed the point at which theirenthusiasm terminated and their hypocrisy commenced or rather it was a point not fixed in itselfbut fluctuating with the state of health ofgood or bad fortune of high or low spirits affectingthe individual at the periodsuch was the celebrated person who turningwoodstock round on wildrake and scanning his countenanceclosely seemed so little satisfied with whathe beheld that he instinctively hitched forwardhis belt so as to bring the handle of his tuckswordwithin his reach but yet folding his armsin his cloak as if upon second thoughts layingaside suspicion or thinking precaution beneathhim he asked the cavalier what he was and whencehe came a poor gentleman sir that is my lordanswered wildrake last from woodstockand what may your tidings be sir gentleman said cromwell with an emphasis trulyi have seen those most willing to take uponthem that title bear themselves somewhat shortof wise men and good men and true men withalltheir gentility yet gentleman was a goodtitle in old england when men remembered whatit was construed to mean'you say truly sir replied wildrake suppressingwith difficulty some of his usual wildexpletives v formerly gentlemen were found ingentlemen's places but now the world is so changedthat you shall find the broidered belt haschanged place with the under spur leatherwoodstocksay'st thou me said the general i professthou art a bold companion that can bandywords so wantonly thou king's somewhat tooloud to be good metal methinks and onceagain what are thy tidings with me this packet said wildrake commendedto your hands by colonel markham everardalas i must have mistaken thee answeredcromwell mollified at the mention of a man'sname whom he had great desire to make hisown forgive us good friend for such wedoubt not thou art sit thee down and communewith thyself as thou mayst until we haveexamined the contents of thy packet let himbe looked to and have what he lacks so sayingthe general left the guardhouse wherewildrake took his seat in the corner and awaitedwith patience the issue of his missionthe soldiers now thought themselves obliged totreat him with more consideration and offered hima pipe of trinidad and a black jack filled withoctober but the look of cromwell and the dangeroussituation in which he might be placed bythe least chance of detection induced wildrake towoodstock decline these hospitable offers and stretchingback in his chair and affecting slumber he escapednotice or conversation until a sort of aiddecampor military officer in attendance cameto summon him to cromwelps presenceby this person he was guided to a posterngatethrough which he entered the body of thecastle and penetrating through many privatepassages and staircases he at length was introducedinto a small cabinet or parlour in whichwas much rich furniture some bearing the royalcypher displayed but all confused and disarrangedtogether with several paintings in massiveframes having their faces turned towards the wallas if they had been taken down for the purposeof being removedin this scene of disorder the victorious generalof the commonwealth was seated in a largeeasy chair covered with damask and deeplyembroidered the splendour of which made astrong contrast with the plain and even homelycharacter of his apparel although in look andaction he seemed like one who felt that the seatwhich might have in former days held a princevol i n woodstockwas not too much distinguished for his own fortunesand ambition wildrake stood before himnor did he ask him to sit down pearson said cromwell addressing himselfto the officer in attendance wait in the gallerybut be within call pearson bowed and wasretiring w ho are in the gallery besides worthy mr gordon the chaplain was holdingforth but now to colonel overtop and fourcaptains of your excellency's regimentwe would have it so said the general we would not there were any corner in ourdwelling where the hungry soul might not meetwith manna was the good man carried onwardin his discourse mightily borne through said pearson and he was touching the rightful claims whichthe army and especially your excellency hathacquired by becoming the instruments in thegreat work not instruments to be broken asunderand cast away when the day of their serviceis over but to be preserved and held preciousand prized for their honourable and faithful laboursfor which they have fought and marchedwoodstock and fasted and prayed and suffered cold andsorrow while others who would now gladly seethem disbanded and broken and cashiered eatof the fat and drink of the strongah good man said cromwell and didhe touch upon this so feelingly i could saysomething but not now begone pearson tothe gallery let not our friends lay aside theirswords but watch as well as praypearson retired and the general holding theletter of everard in his hand looked again foralong while fixedly at wildrake as if consideringin what strain he should address himwhen he did speak it was at first in one ofthose ambiguous discourses which behave alreadydescribed and by which it was very difficult forany one to understand his meaning if indeedhe knew it himself we shall be as concise inour statement as our desire to give the verywords of a man so extraordinary will permitthis letter he said you have broughtus from your master or patron markham everard truly an excellent and honourable gentlemanas ever bore a sword upon his thigh and woodstockone who hath ever distinguished himself in thegreat work of delivering these three poor andunhappy nations answer me not i know whatthou would'st say and this letter he hath sentto me by thee his clerk or secretary in whomhe hath confidence and in whom he prays me tohave trust that there may be a careful messengerbetween us and lastly he hath sent theeto me do not answer i know what thouwould'st say to me who albeit i am of thatsmall consideration that it would be too muchhonour for me even to bear a albert in thisgreat and victorious army of england am neverthelessexalted to the rank of holding the guidanceand the leadingstaff thereof nay do notanswer my friend i know what thou would'stsay now when communing thus together ourdiscourse taketh in respect to what i have saida threefold argument or division first as itconcerned thy master secondly as it concernedus and our office thirdly and lastly as ittouched thyself now as concerning this goodand worthy gentleman colonel markham everardtruly he hath played the man from the bewoodstockginning of these unhappy buffetings not turningto the right or to the left but holding ever inhis eye the mark at which he aimed ay trulya faithful honourable gentleman and one whomay well call me friend and truly i am pleasedto think that he doth so nevertheless in thisvale of tears we must be governed less by ourprivate respects and partialities than by thosehigher principles and points of duty whereuponthe good colonel markham everard hath everframed his purposes as truly i have endeavouredto form mine that we may all act as becomethgood englishmen and worthy patriotsthen as for woodstock it is a great thing whichthe good colonel asks that it should be takenfrom the spoil of the godly and left in keepingof the men of moab and especially of the malignanthenry lee whose hand hath been everagainst us when he might find room to raise it i say he hath asked a great thing both in respectof himself and me for we of this poor butgodly army of england are holden by theseof the parliament as men who should render inspoil for them but be no sharer of it ourselves even as the buck which the hounds pull to earth woodstockfurmsheth no part of their own food but they arelashed off from the carcase with whips like thosewhich require punishment for their forwardnessnot reward for their services yet i speak notthis so much in respect of this grant of woodstockin regard that perhaps their lordshipsof the council and also the committeemen ofthis parliament may graciously think they havegiven me a portion in the matter in relation thatmy kinsman desborough hath an interest allowedhim therein which interest as he hath well deservedit for his true and faithful service to theseunhappy and devoted countries so it would illbecome me to diminish the same to his prejudiceunless it were upon great and public respectsthus thou seest how it stands with me my honestfriend and in what mind i stand touchingthis thy master's request to me which yet i donot say that i can altogether or unconditionallygrant or refuse but only tell my simple thoughtswith regard thereto thou understands me idoubt notnow roger wildrake with all the attentionhe had been able to pay to the lord general'sspeech had got so much confused among thewoodstock various clauses of the harangue that his brainwasbewildered like that of a country clownwhen he chances to get himself involved amonga crowd of carriages and cannot stir a step toget out of the way of one's them without beingin danger of being ridden over by the othersthe general saw his look of perplexity andbegan a new oration to the same purpose as before spoke of his love for his kind friend thecolonel his regard for his pious and godlykinsman master desborough the great importanceof the palace and park of woodstock thedetermination of the parliament that it shouldbe confiscated and the produce brought into thecoffers of the state his own deep veneration forthe authority of parliament and his no less deepsense of the injustice done to the army how itwas his wish and will that all matters should besettled in an amicable and friendly manner withoutselfseeking debate or strife betwixt thosewho had been the hands acting and such ashad been the heads governing in that great nationalcause how he was willing truly willingto contribute to this work by laying down nothis commission only but his life also if it were woodstockrequested of him or could be granted with safetyto the poor soldiers to whom silly poor men hewas bound to be as a father seeing that theyhad followed him with the duty and affection ofchildrenand here he arrived at another dead pauseleaving wildrake as uncertain as before whetherit was or was not his purpose to grantcolonel everard the powers he had asked forthe protection of woodstock against the parliamentarycommissioners internally he beganto entertain hopes that the justice of heaven orthe effects of remorse had confounded the regicide'sunderstanding but no he could seenothing but sagacity in that steady stern eyewhich while the tongue poured forth its periphrasticlanguage in such profusion seemed towatch with severe accuracy the effect which hisoratory produced on the listeneregad thought the cavalier to himselfbecoming a little familiar with the situation inwhich he was placed and rather impatient of aconversation which led to no visible conclusionor termination if noll were the devil himselfwoodstock as he is the devil's darling i will not be thusnoseled by him i'll e'en brusque it a little ifhe goes on at this rate and try if i can bringhim to a more intelligible mode of speakingentertaining this bold purpose but half afraidto execute it wildrake lay by for an opportunityof making the attempt while cromwell wasapparently unable to express his own meaninghe was already beginning a third panegyric uponcolonel everard with sundry varied expressionsof his own wish to oblige him when wildraketook the opportunity of a pause to strike in onthe general's making one of his oratorical pausesso please you he said bluntly your wordship has already spoken on two topics of yourdiscourse your own worthiness and that of mymaster colonel everard but to enable me todomine errand it would be necessary to bestowa few words on the third headthe third said cromwellay said wildrake which in your honour'ssubdivision of your discourse touched onmy unworthy self what am i to do what portionam i to have in this matter woodstockoliver started at once from the tone of voice hehad hitherto used and which somewhat resembledthe purring of a domestic cat into the growlof the tiger when about to spring thy portionjailbird he exclaimed the gallows thou shalt hang as high as human if thou betraycounsel but he added softening his voicekeep it like a true man and my favour will bethemaking of thee come hither thou art boldi see though somewhat saucy thou hast been amalignant so writes my worthy friend coloneleverard but thou hast now given up that fallingcause i tell thee friend not all that the parliamentor the army could do would have pulleddown the stuart out of their high places savingthat heaven had a controversy with them wellit is a sweet and comely thing to buckle on one'sarmour in behalf of heaven's cause otherwisetruly for mine own part these men might haveremained upon the throne even unto this dayneither do i blame any for aiding them untilthese successive great judgments have overwhelmedthem and their house i am not abloody man having in me the feeling of humanwoodstock frailty but friend whosoever putteth his handto the plough in the great actings which are nowon foot in these nations had best beware thatthey do not look back for rely upon my simpleword that if you fail me i will not spare on youone foot's length of the gallows of human letme therefore know at a word if the leaven of thymalignancy is altogether drubbed out of thee your honourable lordship said the cavaliershrugging up his shoulders has done thatfor most of us so far as cudgelling to some tunecan perform itsay'st thou said the general with a grimsmile on his lip which seemed to intimate thathe was not quite inaccessible to flattery yeatruly thou dost not lie in that we have been aninstrument neither are we as i have alreadyhinted so severely bent against those who havestriven against us as malignant as others may bethe parliamentmen best know their own interestand their own pleasure but to my poorthinking it is full time to close these jars and toallow men of all kinds the means of doing serviceto their country and we think it will be thy faultsodwoodstockif thou art not employed to good purpose for thestate and thyself on condition thou protest awaythe old man entirely from thee and gives thyearnest attention to what i have to tell theeyour lordship need not doubt my attentionssaid the cavalierand the republican general after anotherpause as one who gave his confidence not withouthesitation proceeded to explain his viewswith a distinctness which he seldom used yetnot without his being a little biassed now andthen by'his long habits of circumlocution whichindeed he seldom laid entirely aside save in thefield of battlethou seest he said my friend howthings stand with me the parliament i carenot who knows it love me not still less do thecouncil of state by whom they manage the executivegovernment of the kingdom i cannottell why they nourish suspicion against me unlessit is because i will not deliver this poor innocentarmy which has followed me in so manymilitary actions to be now pulled asunder brokenpiecemeal and reduced so that they whowoodstock have protected the state at the expense of theirblood will not have perchance the means offeeding themselves by their labour which methinkswere hard measure since it is takingfrom esau his birthright even without givinghim a poor mess of pottageesau is likely to help himself i think repliedwildraketruly thou say'st wisely replied the general it is ill starving an armed man if thereis food to be had for taking nevertheless far beit from me to encourage rebellion or want of duesubordination to these our rulers i would onlypetition in a due and becoming a sweet and harmoniousmanner that they would listen to ourconditions and consider our necessities but sirlooking on me and esteeming m so little as theydo you must think that it would be a provocationin me towards the council of state as wellas the parliament if simply to gratify your worthymaster i were to act contrary to their purposesor deny currency to the commission undertheir authority which is as yet the highestin the state and long may it be so for me tocarry on the sequestration which they intendsoc woodstockand would it not also be said that i was lendingmyself to the malignant interest affording thisden of the bloodthirsty and lascivious tyrants ofyore to be in this our day a place of refuge tothat old and inveterate amalekite sir henry leeto keep possession of the place in which he hathso long glorified himself truly it would be aperilous matter am i then to reports said wild rake anif it please you that you cannot stead coloneleverard in this matter unconditionally aybut taken conditionallythe answer may be otherwise answeredcromwell i see thou art not able to fathommy purpose and therefore i will partly unfoldit to thee but take notice that should thytongue betray my council save in so far as carryingit to thy master by all the blood which hasbeen shed in these wild times thou shalt die athousand deaths in one do not fear me sir said wildrake whosenatural boldness and carelessness of character wasfor the present time borne down and quelled likethat of falcons in the presence of the eaglehear me then said cromwell and letwoodstock sonno syllable escape thee knowest thou not theyoung lee whom they call albert a malignantlike his father and one who went up with theyoung man to that last ruffle which we had withhim at worcester may we be grateful for thevictory i know there is such a young gentleman asalbert lee said wildrakeand knowest thou not i speak not by wayof prying into the good coroners secrets but onlyas it behoves me to know something of the matterthat i may best judge how i am to serve him knowest thou not that thy master markhameverard is a suitor after the sister of this samemalignant a daughter of the old keeper calledsir henry lee all this i have heard said wildrake norcan i deny that i believe in itwell then go to when the young mancharles stuart fled from the field of worcesterand was by sharp chase and pursuit compelled toseparate himself from his followers i know bysure intelligence that this albert lee was one ofthe last who remained with him if not indeed thevery last woodstockit was devilish like him said the cavalierwithout sufficiently weighing his expressions consideringin what presence they were to be uttered and i'll uphold him with my rapier to beatrue chip of the old blockha dearest thou said the general isthis thy reformation i never swear so please you replied wildrakerecollecting himself except there is somemention of malignant and cavaliers in my hearing and then the old habit returns and i swearlike one of goring's troopersout upon thee said the general whatcan it avail thee to practise a profanity so horribleto the ears of others and which brings noemolument to him who uses it there are doubtless more profitable sins in theworld than the vice of swearing was the answerwhich rose to the lips of the cavalier but that wasexchanged for a profession of regret for havinggiven offence the truth was the discourse beganto take a turn which rendered it more interestingthan ever to wildrake who therefore determinednot to lose the opportunity for obtaining posseswoodstocksion of the secret that seemed to be suspendedon cromwelps lips and that could only bethrough means of keeping guard upon his ownwhat sort of a house is woodstock saidthe general abruptlyan old mansion said wildrake in reply and so far as i could judge by a single night'slodgings having abundance of backstairs alsosubterranean passages and all the communicationsunder ground which are common in oldravennests of the sortand places for concealing priests unquestionablysaid cromwell it is seldom that suchancient houses lack secret stalls wherein to mewup these calves of bethelyour honour's excellency said wildrake may swear to that i swear not at all replied the general drily but what think'st thou good fellow i willask thee a blunt question where will those twoworcester fugitives that thou hottest of be mcm'elikely to take shelter and that they must besheltered somewhere i well know than in thissame old palace with all the corners and concealvoli osio woodstockments whereof young albert hath been acquaintedever since his earliest infancy truly said wildrake making an effort toanswer the question with seeming indifferencewhile the possibility of such an event and its consequencesflashed fearfully upon his mind truly i should be of your honour's opinionbut that i think the company who by thecommission of parliament have occupied woodstockare likely to fright them thence as a catscares doves from a pigeonhouse the neighbourhoodwith reverence of generals lesbosand harrison will suit ill with fugitivesfrom worcesterfieldi thought as much and so indeed would ihave it answered the general long may it beere our names shall be aught but a terror to ourenemies but in this matter if thou art an activeplotter for thy master's interest thou might st ishould think work out something favourable tohis present objectmy brain is too poor to reach the depth ofyour honourable purpose said wildrake listen then and let it be to profit answeredcromwell assuredly the conquest at worechester was a great and crowning'mercy yet mightwe seem to be but small in our thankfulness forthe same did we not do what in us lies towardsthe ultimate improvement and final conclusion ofthe great work which has been thus prosperous inour hands professing in pure humility and singlenessof heart that we do not in any way desireour instrumentality to be remembered naywould rather pray and entreat that our name andfortunes were forgotten than that the great workwere in itself incomplete nevertheless trulyplaced as we now are it concerns us more nearlythan others that is if so poor creatures shouldat all speak of themselves as concerned whethermore or less with these changes which have beenwrought around not i say by ourselves or ourown power but by the destiny to which we werecalled fulfilling the same with all meekness andhumility i say it concerns us nearly that allthings should be done in conformity with thegreat work which hath been wrought and is yetworking in these lands such is my plain andsimple meaning nevertheless it is much to bedesired that this young man this king of scots woodstockas he called himself this charles stuart shouldnot escape forth from the nation where his arrivalhas wrought so much disturbance and bloodshedi have no doubt said the cavalier lookingdown that your lordship's wisdom hath directedall things as they may best lead towards sucha consummation and i pray your pains may bepaid as they deserve i thank thee friend said cromwell withmuch humility doubtless we shall meet ourreward being in the hands of a good paymasterwho never passeth saturday night but understandme friend i desire no more than my ownshare in the good work i would heartily dowhat poor kindness i can to your worthy masterand even to you in your degree for such as i donot converse with ordinary men that our presencemay be forgotten like an everyday's occurrencewe speak to men like thee for their reward ortheir punishment and i trust it will be the formerwhich thou in thine office wilt merit at myhandwoodstock your honour said wildrake speaks likeone accustomed to commandtrue men's minds are likened to those ofmy degree by fear and reverence said the general but enough of that desiring as i do noother dependency on my special person than isalike to us all upon that which is above us buti would desire to cast this golden ball into yourmaster's cap he hath served against this charlesstuart and his father but he is a kinsman nearto the old knight lee and stands well affectedtowards his daughter thou also wilt keep awatch my friend that ruffling look of thine willprocure thee the confidence of every malignantand the prey cannot approach this cover asthough to shelter like a coney in the rocks butthou wilt be sensible of his presencei make a shift to comprehend your excellencysaid the cavalier and i thank youheartily for the good opinion you have put uponme and which i pray i may have some handsomeopportunity of deserving that i may showmy gratitude by the event but still with reverenceyour excellency's scheme seems unlikelywhile woodstock remains in possession of the woodstocksequestrated both the old knight and his sonand far more such a fugitive as your honour hintedat will take special care not to approach it tillthey are removedit is for that i have been dealing with theethus long said the general i told thee thati was something unwilling upon slight occasionto dispossess the sequestrated by my own properwarrant although having perhaps sufficient authorityin the state both to do so and to despisethe murmurs of those who blame me in briefi would be loath to tamper with my privilegesand make experiments between their strengthand the powers of the commission granted byothers without need or at least great prospect ofadvantage so if thy colonel will undertake forhis love of the republic to find the means ofpreventing its worst and nearest danger whichmust needs occur from the escape of this youngman and will do his endeavour to stay him incasehis flight should lead him to woodstockwhich i hold very likely i will give thee an orderto these sequestrated to evacuate the palaceinstantly and to the text troop of my regimentwhich lies at oxford to turn them out by thewoodstock shoulders if they make any scruples ay evenfor example's sake if they drag desborough outforemost though he be wedded to my sisterso please you sir said wildrake andwith your most powerful warrant i trust i mightexpel the commissioners even without the aidof your most warlike and devout troopersthat is what i am least anxious about repliedthe general i should like to see the bestof them sit after i had nodded to them to begone always excepting the worshipful housein whose name our commissions run but who assome think will be done with politics ere it betime to renew them therefore what chieflyconcerns me to know is whether thy masterwill embrace a traffic which hath such a fairpromise of profit with it i am well convincedthat with a scout like thee who hast been in thecavaliers quarters and canst i should guessresume thy drinking ruffianly healthquaffingmanners whenever thou hast a mind he mustdiscover where this stuart hath ensconced

someconfidence what is the figure of this younggallant in case i should find him a tall rawboned swarthy lad they saywoodstock he has shot up into here is his picture by agood hand some time since he turned roundone of the portraits which stood with its faceagainst the wall but it proved not to be that ofcharles the second but of his unhappy fatherthe first motion of cromwell indicated a purposeof hastily replacing the picture and it seemedas if an effort was necessary to repress his disinclinationto look upon it but he did repressit and placing the picture against the wall withdrewslowly and sternly as if in defiance of hisown feeling he was determined to gain a placefrom which to see it to advantage it was well forwildrake that his dangerous companion had notturned an eye on him for his

violencehe had been provided with a suitable weaponit is possible cromwell would never haveascended higher in his bold ascent towards supremepowerbut this natural and sudden flash of indignantwoodstocklion which rushed through the veins of an ordinaryman like wildrake was presently subduedwhen confronted with the strong yet stifled emotiondisplayed by so powerful a character ascromwell as the cavalier looked on his darkand bold countenance agitated by inward andindescribable feelings he found his own violenceof spirit die away and lose itself in fear andwonder so true it

firm sternness of eye and manner as one whocompels himself to look on what some strong internalfeeling renders painful and disgustful tohim proceeded in brief and interrupted expressionsbut yet with a firm voice to comment onthe portrait of the late king his words seemedwoodstock less addressed to wildrake than to be the spontaneousunburthening of his own bosom swellingunder recollection of the past and anticipationof the futurethat flemish painter he said that antoniovandyke what a power he has steelmay mutilate warriors may waste and destroy still the king stands uninjured by time and

commander he who had overcomesuch difficulties and ascended to suchheights that he seemed already to bestride theland which he had conquered had like manyother men of great genius a constitutional taintof melancholy which sometimes displayed itselfboth in words and actions and had been firstobserved in that sudden and striking changewhen abandoning entirely the dissolute freaksof his youth he embraced a very strict course ofwoodstock religious observances which upon some occasionshe seemed to consider as bringing him intomore near and close contact with the spiritualworld this extraordinary man is said sometimesduring that period of his life to havegiven way to spiritual delusions or as he himselfconceived them prophetic inspirations ofapproaching grandeur and of strange deep andmysterious agencies in which he was in future tobe engaged in the same manner as his youngeryears had been marked by fits of exuberant andexcessive frolic and debaucheries something ofthis kind seemed to explain the ebullitions ofpassion which he had now manifestedwith wonder at what he had witnessed wildrakefelt some anxiety on his own account thoughnot the most reflecting of mortals he had senseenough to know that it is dangerous to be a witnessof the infirmities of men high in power andhe was left so long by himself as induced him toentertain some secret doubts whether the generalmight not be tempted to take means of confiningor removing a witness who had seen him loweredas it seemed by the suggestions of his own woodstockconscience beneath that lofty flight which

wisdom and forbearance of cromwellnow you have my secret you are awarethat i am not doing the best i would but thebest i can i wish not so ardently as thouperhaps yet i do wish that the king could

good fairweatherfolks who love the stronger party come andmake common cause with uswithout much attending to what his friendsaid colonel everard carefully studied the warrantof cromwell it is bolder and more peremptorythan i expected he said the generalmust feel himself strong when he opposeshis own authority so directly to that of the councilof state and the parliament you will not hesitate to act upon it saidwildrake that i certainly will not answered everard but i must wait till i have the assistanceof the mayor who i think will gladly see thesewoodstock sifellows ejected from the lodge i must not goaltogether upon military authority if possiblethen stepping to the door of the apartment hedispatched a servant of the house in quest of thechief magistrate desiring he should be

citizen trot in thesedays when one sword is worth fifty corporationcharters but there are dragoons yonder aswell as the grimfaced knave whom i frightenedthe other evening when i showed my face in atthe window think'st thou the knaves will showno rough play the general's warrant will weigh more withthem than a dozen acts of parliament said everard but it is time thou latest if thou hastin truth ridden from windsor hither withoutbaitingi care not about it said wildrake ihell thee your general gave me a breakfastsvhich i think will serve me one while if i ever woodstockam able to digest it by the mass it lay so heavyon my conscience that i carried it to church tosee if i could digest it there with my other sinsbut not a avaitto church to the door of the churchthou meanest said everard i know thy waythou art ever wont to pull thy hat off reverentlyat the threshold but for crossing it thatday seldom comeswell replied wildrake and if i do pulloff my castor and kneel is it not seemly to showthe same respects in a church which we offerin a palace it is a dainty matter is it notto see your anabaptists and brownish and therest of you gather to a sermon with as littleceremony as hogs to a trough but here comesfood and now for a grace if i can rememberoneeverard was too much interested about thefate of his uncle and his fair cousin and the prospectof restoring them to their quiet home underthe protection of that formidable truncheon whichwas already regarded as the leadingstaff of englandto remark that certainly a great alterationwoodstock had taken place in the manners and outwardbehaviour at least of his companion his demeanourfrequently evinced a sort of strugglebetwixt old habits of indulgence and some newlyformed resolutions of abstinence and it wasalmost ludicrous to see how often the hand ofthe neophyte directed itself naturally to a largeblack leathern jack which contained two doubleflagons of strong ale and how often divertedfrom its purpose by the better reflections of thereformed toper it seized instead upon a lai'gcewer of salubrious and pure water it was easy to see that the task of sobrietywas not yet become easy and that if it had therecommendation of the intellectual portion ofthe party who had resolved upon it the outwardman yielded a reluctant and restive compliancebut honest wildrake had been dreadfully frightenedat the course proposed to him by cromwelland with a feeling not peculiar to the catholicreligion had formed a solemn resolutionwithin his own mind that if he came off safe andwith honour from this dangerous interview hewould show his sense of heavens favour bys woodstockrenouncing some of the sins which most easilybeset him and especially that of intemperanceto which like many of his wild compeers he wastoo much addictedthis resolution or vow was partly prudentialas well as religious for it occurred to him asvery possible that some matters of a difficult anddelicate nature might be thrown into his handsat the present emergency during the conductof which it would be fitting for him to act bysome better oracle than that of the bottle celebratedby rabelais in full compliance with thisprudent determination he touched neither theale nor the brandy which was placed before himand declined peremptorily the sack with whichhis friend would have garnished the board neverthelessjust as the boy removed the trenchersand napkins together with the large black jackwhich we have already mentioned and was oneor two steps on his way to the door the sinewyarm of the cavalier which seemed to elongateitself on purpose as it extended far beyond thefolds of the threadbare jacket arrested the progressof the retiring ganymede and seizing onwoodstock the black jack conveyed it to the lips which weregently breathing forth the aspiration d ni mean heaven forgive me ewe are poorcreatures of clay one modest sip must be permittedto our frailtyso murmuring he glued the huge flagon tohis lips and as the head was slowly and graduallyinclined backwards in proportion as theright hand elevated the bottom of the pitchereverard had great doubts whether the drinkerand the cup were likely to part until the wholecontents of the latter had been transferred to theperson of the former roger wildrake stintedhowever when by a moderate computation hehad swallowed at one draught about a quart anda halfhe then replaced it on the salver fetched along breath to refresh his lungs bade the boyget him gone with the rest of the liquors in atone which inferred some dread of his constancyand then turning to his friend everard he expatiatedin praise of moderation observing thatthe mouthful which he had just taken had beenof more service to him than if he had remainedsc woodstockquaffing healths at table for four hours togetherhis friend made no reply but could not helpbeing privately of opinion that wildrakes temperancehad done as much execution on the tankardin his single draught as some more moderatetopers might have effected if they had satsipping for an evening but the subject waschanged by the entrance of the landlord whocame to announce to his honour colonel everardthat the worshipful mayor of woodstockwith the rev master holdenough were cometo wait upon himwoodstock schapter x here have we one headupon two bodies your twoheaded bullockis but an ass to such a prodigythese two have but one meaning thought and counsel and when the single noddle has spoke outthe four legs scrape assent to itold playin the goodly form of the honest mayor therewas a bustling mixture of importance and embarrassmentlike the deportment of a man who wasconscious that he had an important part to actif he could but exactly discover what that partwas but both were mingled with much pleasureat seeing everard and he frequently repeatedhis welcomes and allhails before he could bebrought to attend to what that gentleman said inreplygood worthy colonel you are indeed a desirablesight to woodstock at all times being asi may say almost our townsman as you have woodstocktlwelt so much and so long at the palace trulythe matter begins almost to pass my wit thoughi have transacted the affairs of this borough formany a long day and you are come to my assistancelike liketanquam deus ex machina as the ethnicpoet hath it said master holdenough althoughi do not often quote from such booksmaster markham everard or worthycolonel as i ought rather to say you are simplythe most welcome man who has come towoodstock since the days of old king harry i had some business with you my goodfriend said the colonel addressing the mayori shall be glad if it should so happen at thesame time that i may find occasion to pleasureyou or your worthy pastor no question you can do so good sir interposedmaster holdenough you have the heartsir and you have the hand and we are much inwant of good counsel and that from a man of actioni am aware worthy colonel that you andyour worthy father have ever borne yourselvesin these turmoils like men of a truly christianand moderate spirit striving to pour oil into thewoodstock wounds of the land which some would rub withvitriol and pepper and we know you are faithfulchildren of the church we have reformedfrom its papistical and prelatical tenets my good and reverend friend said everard i respect the piety and learning of manyof your teachers but i am also for liberty ofconscience to all men i neither side with sectariesnor do i desire to see them the object ofsuppression by violence sir sir said the presbyterian hastily allthis hath a fair sound but i would you shouldthink what a fine country and church we are liketo have of it amidst the errors blasphemies andschisms which are daily introduced into thechurch and kingdom of england so that worthymaster edwards in his gangrene declared thatour native country is about to become the verysink and cesspool of all schisms heresies blasphemiesand confusions as the army of hannibalwas said to be the refuse of au naiionscouuviesomnium gentium believe me worthy colonelthat they of the honourable house view all thisover lightly and with the winking connivance of woodstockold eli these instructors the schismatics shoulderthe orthodox ministers out of their pulpitsthrust themselves into families and break up thepeace thereof stealing away men's hearts fromthe established faith my good master holdenough replied thecolonel interrupting the zealous preacher thereis ground of sorrow for all these unhappy discords and i hold with you that the fiery spiritsof the present time have raised men's minds atonce above soberminded and sincere religionand above decorum and common sense butthere is no help save patience enthusiasm is astream that may foam off in its own time whereasit is sure to bear down every barrier which isdirectly opposed to it but what are these schismaticalproceedings to our present purpose why partly this sir said holdenoughalthough perhaps you may make less of it thani should have thought before we met i wasmyself i nehemiah holdenough he addedconsequentially was forcibly expelled from myown pulpit even as a man should have beenthrust out of his own house by an alien and woodstock iian intruder a wolf who was not at the troubleeven to put on sheep's clothing but came inhis native wolfish attire of buff and bandalierand held forth in my stead to the people whoare to me as a flock to the lawful shepherd itis too true sir master mayor saw it and stroveto take such order to prevent it as man mightthough turning to the mayor i think still youmight have striven a little moregood now good master holdenough do notlet us go back on that question said the mayorguy of warwick or bevis of hampton mightdo something with this generation but trulythey are too many and too strong for the mayorof woodstocki think master mayor speaks very goodsense said the colonel if the independentsare not allowed to preach i fear me they will notfight and then if you were to have another risingof cavaliers there are worse folks may rise than cavalierssaid holdenoughhow sir replied colonel everard letvol i q woodstockme remind you master holdenough that is nosafe language in the present state of the nationi say said the presbyterian there areworse folks may rise than cavaliers and i willprove what i say the devil is worse than theworst cavalier that ever drunk a health or sworean oath and the devil has arisen at woodstocklodge ay truly hath he said the mayor bodilyand visibly in figure and form an awfultime we live in gentlemen i really know not how i am tounderstand you said everardwhy it was even about the devil we cameto speak with you said the mayor but theworthy minister is always so hot upon the sectarieswhich are the devil's brats and nearly akinto him said master holdenough but true itis that the growth of these sects has brought upthe evil one even upon the face of the earth tolook after his own interest where he finds it mostthrivingmaster holdenough said the colonel ifwoodstock you speak figuratively i have already told youthat i have neither the means nor the skill sufficientto temper these religious heats but if youdesign to say that there has been an actual apparitionof the devil i presume to think that youwith your doctrine and your learning would beafitter match for him than a soldier like metrue sir and i have that confidence in thecommission which i hold that i would take thefield against the foul fiend without a moment'sdelay said holdenough but the place inwhich he hath of late appeared being woodstockis filled with those dangerous and impiouspersons of whom i have been but now complaining and though i dare venture in disputationwith their great master himself yet without yourprotection most worthy colonel i see not thati may with prudence trust myself with the tossingand goring ox desborough or the bloodyand devouring bear harrison or the cold andpoisonous snake bletson all of whom are nowat the lodge doing license and taking spoil asthey think meet and as all men say the devilhas come to make a fourth with thems woodstockin good truth worthy and noble sir saidthe mayor it is even as master holdenoughsays our privileges are declared void our cattleseized in the very pastures they talk of cuttingdown and dispersing the fair chase which hasbeen so long the pleasure of so many kings andmaking woodstock of as little note as any paltryvillage i assure you we heard of your arrivalwith joy and wondered at your keeping yourselfo close in your lodgings we know no one saveyour father or you that are like to stand thepoor burgesses friend in this extremity since almostall the gentry around are malignant andunder sequestration we trust therefore youwill make strong intercession in our behalf certainly master mayor said the colonelwho saw himself with pleasure anticipated itwas my very purpose to have interfered in thismatter and i did but keep myself alone untili should be furnished with some authority fromthe lord general powers from the lord general said themayor thrusting the clergyman with his elbow dost thou hear that what cock will fightwoodstock that cock we shall carry it now over theirneekfi and woodstock shall be brave woodstockstill keep thine elbow from my side friends'said holdenough annoyed by the action whichthe mayor had suited to his words and maythe lord send that cromwell prove not as sharpto the people of england as thy bones againstmy person yet i approve that we should usehis authority to stop the course of these men'sproceedingslet us set out then said colonel everard and i trust we shall find the gentlemen reasonableand obedientthe functionaries laic and clerical assentedwith much joy and the colonel required andreceived wildrake's assistance in putting on hiscloak and rapier as if he had been the dependantwhose part he acted the cavalier contrivedhowever while doing him these menial offices togive his friend a shrewd pinch in order to maintainthe footing of secret equality betwixt themthe colonel was saluted as they passed throughthe streets by many of the anxious inhabitantsj woodstockwho seemed to consider his intervention as affordingthe only chance of saving their fine park andthe rights of the corporation as well as of individualsfrom ruin and confiscationas they entered the park the colonel askedhis companions what is this you say of apparitionsbeing seen amongst them why colonel said the clergyman youknow yourself that woodstock was always hauntedi have lived therein many a day said thecolonel and i know that i never saw theleast sign of it although idle people spoke of thehouse as they do of all old mansions and gavethe apartments ghosts and spectres to fill up theplaces of the deceased great who had ever dwelttherenay but good colonel said the clergymani trust you have not reached the prevailing sinof the times and become indifferent to the testimonyin favour of apparitions which appears soconclusive to all but atheists and advocates forwitches i would not absolutely disbelieve what is sowoodstock generally affirmed said the colonel but mytemper leads me to doubt most of the storieswhich i have heard of this sort and my own experiencenever went to confirm any of themay but trust me said holdenough therewas always a demon of one or the other speciesabout this woodstock not a man or woman inthe town but has heard stories of apparitions inthe forest or about the old castle sometimes itis a pack of hounds that sweep along and thewhoops and hollow of the huntsman and thewinding of horns and the galloping of horsewhich is heard as if first more distant and thenclose around you and then anon it is a solitaryhuntsman who asks if you can tell him whichway the stag has gone he is always dressed ingreen but the fashion of his clothes is some fivehundred years old this is what we call demonmeridian the noonday spectremy worthy and reverend sir said the colonel i have lived at woodstock many seasonsand have traversed the chase at all hours trustme what you hear from the villagers is the growthof their idle folly and superstitioncolonel replied holdenough a negative woodstockproves nothing what signifies craving yourpardon that you have not seen anything be itearthly or be it of the other world to detract fromthe evidence of a score of people who have and besides there is the demon nocturnal the being that walketh by night he has beenamong these independents and schismatics lastnight

competent knowledgeof theology and an acquaintance with the humaneletters ay and a regular clerical educationand clerical calling'i do not in the least doubt said the colonel the efficacy of your qualifications to lay thedevil but still i think some odd mistake has occasionedthis confusion amongst them if therehas any such in reality existed desborough is ablockhead to be sure and harrison is fanaticenough to believe anything but there is bletsonon the other hand who believes nothing what do you know of this matter good mastermayor rwoodstock in sooth and it was master bletson who gavethe first alarm replied the magistrate or atleast the first distinct one you see sir i wasin bed with my wife and no one else and i wasas fast asleep as a man can desire to be at twohours after midnight when behold you they cameknocking at my bedroom door to tell me therewas an alarm in woodstock and that the bell ofthe lodge was ringing at that dead hour of thenight as hard as ever it rung when it called thecourt to dinner well but the cause of this alarm said thecolonel you shall hear worthy colonel you shallhear answered the mayor waving his handwith dignity for he was one of those personswho will not be hurried out of their own paceso mrs mayor would have persuaded me inher love and affection poor wretch that to riseat such an hour out of my warm bed was liketo bring on my old complaint the lumbago andthat i should send the people to alderman button alderman devil mrs mayor said i i beg your reverence's pardon for using such a woodstockphrase do you think i am going to lie abedwhen the town is on fire and the cavaliers upand the devil to pay i beg pardon again parsonbut here we are before the gate of thepalace will it not please you to enter i would first hear the end of your storysaid the colonel that is master mayor if ithappens to have an end everything hath an end said the mayor and that which we call a pudding hath twoyour worship will forgive me for being facetiouswhere was i o i jumped out of bed andput on my red plush breeches with the blue netherstocks for i always make a point of beingdressed suitably to my dignity night and daysummer or winter colonel everard and i tookthe constable along with me in case the alarmshould be raised by nightwalkers or thieves andcalled up worthy master holdenough out of hisbed in case it should turn out to be the deviland so i thought i was provided for the worstand so away we came and by and by the soldierswho came to the town with master tompkinswho had been called to arms came marchingwoodstock down to woodstock as fast as their feet wouldcarry them so i gave our people the sign to letthem pass us and outmarch us as it were andthis for a twofold reasoni will be satisfied interrupted the colonelwith one good reason you desired the redcoatsshould have ther of the fraytrue sir very true and also that theyshould have the last of it in respect that fightingis their especial business however we came onat a slow pace as men who are determined to dotheir duty without fear or favour when suddenlywe saw something white haste away up theavenue towards the town when six of our constablesand assistants fled at once as conceivingit to be an apparition called the white womanof woodstocklook you there colonel said master holdenough i told you there were demons of morekinds than one which haunt the ancient scenes ofroyal debauchery and cruelty i hope you stood your own ground mastermayor said the coloneli yes most assuredly that is i did notsss woodstockstrictly speaking keep my ground but the townclerkand i retreated retreated colonel andwithout confusion or dishonour and took post behindworthy master holdenough who with thespirit of a lion threw himself in the way of thesupposed spectre and attacked it with such aliterary of latin as might have scared the devilhimself and thereby plainly discovered that itwas no devil at all nor white woman neitherwoman of any colour but worshipful master bretona member of the house of commons andone of the commissioners sent hither upon thisunhappy sequestration of the wood chase andlodge of woodstockand this was all you saw of the demon said the coloneltruly yes answered the mayor and ihad no wish to see more however we conveyedmaster bletson as in duty bound back to thelodge and he was ever maundering by the wayhow that he met a party of scarlet devils incarnatemarching down to the lodge but to my poorthinking it must have been the independent dragoonswho had just passed uswoodstock and more incarnate devils i would neverwish to see said wildrake who cour remainsilent no longer his voice so suddenly heardshowed how much the mayor's nerves were stillalarmed for he started and jumped aside with analacrity of which no one would at first sight supposea man of his portly dignity to have beencapable everard imposed silence on his intrusiveattendant and desirous to hear the conclusionof this strange story requested the mayorto tell him how the matter ended and whetherthey stopped the supposed spectre truly worthy sir said the mayor masterholdenough was quite venturous upon confrontingas it were the devil and compellinghim to appear under the real form of masterjoshua bletson member of parliament for theborough of littlefaithin sooth master mayor said the divine iwere strangely ignorant of my own commissionand its immunities if i were to value opposingmyself to satan or any independent in his likenessall of whom in the name of him i servei do defy spit at and trample under my feet woodstockand because master mayor is something tediousi will briefly inform your honour that we sawlittle of the enemy that night save what masterbletson said in the first feeling of his terrors andsave what we might collect from the disorderedappearance of the honourable colonel desboroughand majorgeneral harrisonand what plight were they in i pray you demanded the colonel why worthy sir every one might see withhalf an eye that they had been engaged in a fightwherein they had not been honoured with victoryseeing that general harrison was stalkingup and down the parlour with his drawn swordin his hand talking to himself his doublet unbuttonedhis points untrussed his garters looseand like to throw him down as he now and thentrod on them and gaping and grinning like amad player and yonder sate desborough witha dry pottle of sack before him which he had justemptied and which though the element in whichhe trusted had not restored him sense enough tospeak or courage enough to look over his shoulderhe had a bible in his hand forsooth as if itwoodstock would make battle against the evil one but ipeered over his shoulder and alas the goodgentleman held the bottom of the page uppermostit was as if one of your musketeers nobleand valued sir were to present the butt ofhis piece at the enemy instead of the muzzleha ha ha it was a sight to judge of schismaticsby both in point of head and in point of heartyin point of skill and in point of courage oh colonel then was the time to see the true characterof an authorized pastor of souls over thoseunhappy men who leap into the fold without dueand legal authority and will forsooth preachteach and exhort and blasphemously term thedoctrine of the church saltless porridge and drychipsi have no doubt you were ready to meet thedanger reverend sir but i would fain know ofwhat nature it was and from whence it was to beapprehended was it for me to make such inquiry saidthe clergyman triumphantly is it for a bravesoldier to number his enemies or inquire fromwhat quarter they are to come no sir i wasui woodstockthere with match lighted bullet in my mouthand my marquess shouldered to encounter asmany devils as hell could pour in were theycountless as motes in the sunbeam and camefrom all points of the compass the papists talkof the temptation of st anthony pshaw letthem double all the myriads which the brain of acrazy dutch painter hath invented

againstyonder poor hound day after day and night afternight he will at once pack them off as witha vengeance to the uttermost parts of assyriastill said the colonel i pray to knowwhether you saw anything upon which to exerciseyour pious learning saw answered the divine no truly isaw nothing nor did i look for anything thieveswill not attack wellarmed travellers nor will devilsor evil spirits come against one who bears inhis bosom the word of truth in the very languagein which it was first dictated no sir they shunwoodstocka divine who can understand the holy text as acrow is said to keep wide of a gun loaded withhailshotthey had walked a little way back upon theirroad to give time for this conversation and thecolonel perceiving it was about to lead to no satisfactoryexplanation of the real cause of alarmon the preceding night turned round and observingit was time they should go to the lodgebegan to move in that direction with his threecompanionsit was now becoming dark and the towers ofwoodstock arose high above the umbrageousshroud which the forest spread around the ancientand venerable mansion from one of thehighest turrets which could still be distinguishedas it rose against the clear blue sky there gleameda light like that of a candle within the buildingthe mayor stopt short and catching fasthold of the divine and then of colonel everardexclaimed in a trembling and hasty but suppressedtone do you see yonder light ray marry do i said colonel everardsand what does that matter a light in a garvoli rsf woodstockretroom of such an old mansion as woodstockis no subject for wonder i trowbut a light from rosamond's tower is surelyso said the mayortrue said the colonel something surprisedwhen after a careful examination he satisfiedhimself that the worthy magistrate's conjecturewas real that is indeed rosamond'stower and as the drawbridge by which it wasaccessible has been destroyed for centuries it ishard to say what chance could have lighted alamp in such an inaccessible placethat light burns with no earthly fuel saidthe mayor neither from whale nor olive norbeeswax nor muttonsuet either i dealt inthese commodities colonel before i went intomy present line and i can assure you i coulddistinguish the sort of light they give one fromanother at a greater distance than yonder turretlook you that is no earthly flame see younot something blue and reddish upon the edges that bodes full well where it comes from colonel in my opinion we had better go back tosup at the town and leave the devil and thewoodstock redcoats to settle their matters together for tonightand then when we come back the nextmorning we will have a pull with the party thatchances to keep afieldyou will do as you please master mayorsaid everard but my duty requires me that ishould see the commissioners to nightand mine requires me to see the foul fiend'said master holdenough if he dare make himselfvisible to me i wonder not that knowingis approaching he betakes himself to the verycitadel the inner and the last defences of thisancient and haunted mansion he is dainty iwarrant you and must dwell where is a relish ofluxury and murder about the walls of his chamberin yonder turret sinned rosamond andin yonder turret she suffered and there she sitsor more likely the enemy in her shape as ihave heard true men of woodstock tell i waiton you good colonel master mayor will do ashepleases the strong man hath fortified himselfin his dwellinghouse but lo there comesanother stronger than hefor me said the mayor who am as unwoodstocklearned as i am un warlike i will not engage eitherwith the powers of the earth or the prince ofthe powers of the air and i will go back towoodstock and hark ye good fellow slappingwildrake on the shoulder i will bestowon thee a shilling wet and a shilling dry if thouwilt go with megadzojkers master mayor said wildrakeneither flattered by the magistrate's familiarityof address nor captivated by his munificence i wonder who the devil made youand nee fellows and besides do you think iwould go back to woodstock with your worshipfulcodeshead when by good management imay get a peep of fair rosamond and see whethershe was that choice and incomparable piece ofware which the world has been told of by rhymersand balladmakers speak less lightly and wantonly friendsaid the divine we are to resist the devil thathe may flee from us and not to tamper withhim or enter into his counsels or traffic with themerchandize of his great vanity fairmind what the good man says wildrakewoodstock said the colonel and take heed another timehow thou dost suffer thy wk to outrun discretioni am beholden to the reverend gentlemanfor his advice answered wildrake upon whosetongue it was difficult to impose any curb whatevereven when his own safety rendered it mostdesirable but gadzookers let him have hadwhat experience he will in fighting with the devilhe never saw one so black as i had a tusslewith not a hundred years agohow friend said the clergyman who understoodeverything literally when apparitionswere mentioned have you had so late a visitationof satan believe me then that i wonderwhy thou dearest to entertain his name sooften and so lightly as i see thou dost use it inthy ordinary discourse but when and wheredidst thou see the evil one everard hastily interposed lest by somethingyet more strongly alluding to cromwell his imprudentsquire should in mere wantonness betrayhis interview with the general theyoung man raves he said of a dream which woodstockhe had the other night when he and i slept togetherin victor lee's chamber belonging to theranger's apartments at the lodgesthanks for help at a pinch good patronsaid wildrake whispering into everard's earwho in vain endeavoured to shake him off afib never failed a fanaticyou also spoke something too lightly ofthese matters considering the work which wehave in hand worthy colonel said the presbyteriandivine believe me the young manthy servant was more like to see visions than todream merely idle dreams in that apartment for i have always heard that next to rosamond'stower in which as i said she playedthe wanton and was after ward's poisoned byqueen eleanor victor lee's chamber was theplace in the lodge of woodstock more peculiarlythe haunt of evil spirits i pray you youngman tell me this dream or vision of yourswith all my heart sir said wildrakethen addressing his patron who began to interfereshe said tush sir you have had the discoursefor an hour send why should not i holdwoodstock forth in my turn by this darkness if you keepme silent any longer i will turn independentpreacher and stand up in your despite for thefreedom of private judgment and so reverendsir i was dreaming of a carnal advertisement calleda bullbaiting and methought there wereventuring dogs at head as merrily as e'er i sawthem at tutburybullrunning and methoughti heard some one say there was the devil come tohave a sight of the bullring well i thought thatgad swoons i would have a peep at his infernalmajesty so i looked and there was a butcher ingreasy woollen with his steel by his side but hewas none of the devil and there was a drunkencavalier with his mouth full of oaths and hisstomach full of emptiness and a goldlaced waistcoatin a very dilapidated condition and a raggedhat with a piece of a feather in it and hewas none of the devil neither and here was amiller his hands dusty with meal and everyatom of it stolen and there was a vintner hisgreen apron stained with wine and every dropof it sophisticated but neither was the old gentlemani looked for to be detected among those woodstockartizans of iniquity at length sir i saw rgrave person with cropped hair a pair of longishand projecting ears a band as broad as a

and adivine nay let him proceed said the minister withperfect equanimity if thy friend or secretaryis gibing i must have less patience than becomesmy profession if i could not bear an idlejest and forgive him who makes it or if onthe other hand the enemy has really presentedhimself to the young man in such a guise asheintimates wherefore should we be surprisedthat he who can take upon him the form of anangel of light should be able to assume that ofa frail and peccable mortal whose spiritual callingand profession ought indeed to induce himto make his life an example to others but whoseconduct nevertheless such is the imperfection ofwoodstock scourunassisted nature sometimes rather presentsus with a warning of what we should shun now by the mass honest dominie i meanreverend sir i crave you a thousand pardonssaid wildrake penetrated by the quietness andpatience of the presbyter's rebuke by stgeorge if quiet patience will do it thou art fitto play a game at foils with the devil himselfand i would be contented to hold stakesas he concluded an apology which was certainlynot uncalled for and seemed to be receivedin perfectly good part they approached soclose to the exterior door of the lodge that theywere challenged with the emphatic stand by asentinel who mounted guard there coloneleverard replied a friend and the sentinel repeatinghis command stand friend proceededto call the corporal of the guard the corporalcame forth and at the same time turnedout his guard colonel everard gave his nameand designation as well as those of his companionson which the corporal said he doubtednot there would be orders for his instant admissionbut in the first place mr tomkins woodstockmust be consulted that he might learn theirhonours mind how sir said the colonel do youknowing who i am presume to keep me on theoutside of your post not if your honour pleases to enter saidthe corporal and undertakes to be my warranty but such are the orders of my postnay then do your duty said the colonel but are the cavaliers up or what is the matterthat you keep so close and strict a watch the fellow gave no distinct answer but mutteredbetween his moustaches something aboutthe enemy and the roaring lion who goethabout seeking what he may devour presentlyafterwards tomkins appeared followed by twoservants bearing lights in great standing brasscandlesticks they

table of large dimensions placed near theblazing chimney on which were arranged wineand ale and materials for smoking then the generalindulgence of the time there was a speciesof movable cupboard set betwixt the table andthe door calculated originally for a display ofplate upon grand occasions but at present onlyused as a screen which purpose it served so effectactuallythat ere he had coasted around it everardheard the following fragment of what desboroughwas saying in his coarse strong voice sent him to share with us fse warrant ye itwas always his excellency my brotherinlaw'sway if he made a treat for five friends he wouldinvite more than the table could hold i haveknown him ask three men to eat two eggshush hush said bletson and the servantsmaking their appearance from behind the tall cupboardannounced colonel everard it may notbe unpleasing to the reader to have a descriptionof the party into which he now entereddesborough was a stout bullnecked man ofmiddle size with heavy vulgar features grizzledbushy eyebrows and walleyes the flourishof his powerful relative's fortunes had burstforth in the finery of his dress which was muchmore ornamented than was usual among the roundheadsthere was embroidery on his cloak andlace upon his band his hat displayed a featherwith a golden clasp and all his habiliments werethose of a cavalier or follower of the court ratherthan the plain dress of a parliamentarian officers woodstockbut heaven knows there was little of courtlikegrace or dignity in the person or demeanour ofthe individual who became his fine suit as thehog on the signpost does his gilded armour itwas not that he was positively deformed or misshapedfor taken in detail the figure was wellenough but his limbs seemed to act upon differentand contradictory principles they werenot as the play says in a concatenation accordingly the right hand moved as if it were uponbad terms with the left and the legs showed an inclinationto foot it in different and opposite directionsin short to use an extravagant comparisonthe members of colonel desborough seemedrather to resemble the disputatious representativesof a federative congress than the wellorderedunion of the orders of the state in a firm andwellcompacted monarchy where each holds hisown place and all obey the dictates of a commonheadgeneral harrison the second of the commissionerswas a tall thin middleaged man whohad risen into his high situation in the armyand his intimacy with cromwell by his dauntlesswoodstock courage in the field and the popularity he hadacquired by his exalted enthusiasm amongst themilitary saints sectaries and independents whocomposed the strength of the existing army harrisonwas of mean extraction and bred up to hisfather's employment of a butcher neverthelesshis appearance though coarse was not vulgar likethat of desborough who had so much the advantageof him in birth and education he hadas we have said a masculine height and strengthof figure was well made and in his manner announceda rough military character which mightbe feared but could not be the object of contemptor ridicule his aquiline nose and dark blackeyes set off to some advantage a countenanceotherwise irregular and the wild enthusiasm thatsometimes sparkled in them as he dilated on hisopinions to others and often seemed to slumberunder his long dark eyelashes as he mused uponthem himself gave something strikingly wild andeven noble to his aspect he was one of the chiefleaders of those who were called fifthmonarchymen who going even beyond the usual fanaticismof the age presumptuously interpreted thes woodstockbook of the revelations after their own fanciesconsidered that the second advent of the messiahand the millennium or reign of the saintsupon earth was close at hand and that theythemselves illuminated as they believed with thepower of foreseeing these approaching events werethe choice instruments for the establishment of thenew reign or fifth monarchy as it was calledand were fated also to win its honours whethercelestial or terrestrialwhen this spirit of enthusiasm which operatedlike a partial insanity was not immediatelyaffecting harrison's mind he was a shrewd worldlyman and a good soldier one who missed noopportunity of mending his fortune and who inexpecting the exaltation of the fifth monarchywas in the meanwhile a ready instrument for theestablishment of the lord generals supremacywhether it was owing to his early occupationand habits of indifference to pain or bloodshedto natural disposition and want of feeling orfinally to the awakened character of his enthusiasmwhich made him look upon those who opposedhim as opposing the divine will and thereforewoodstock meriting no favour or mercy is not easy to saybut all agreed that after a victory or the successfulstorm of a town harrison was one of themost cruel and pitiless men in cromwelps army always urging some misapplied text to authorizethe continued execution of the fugitives and sometimeseven putting to death those who had surrenderedthemselves prisoners it was said that attimes the recollection of some of those crueltiestroubled his conscience and disturbed the dreamsof beatification in which his imagination indulgedwhen everard entered the apartment thistrue representative of the fanatical soldiers of theday who filled those ranks and regiments whichcromwell had politically kept on foot while heprocured the reduction of those in which the presbyterianinterest predominated was seated a littleapart from the others his legs crossed and stretchedout at length towards the fire his head restingon his elbow and turned upwards as if studyingwith the most profound gravity the halfseencarving of the gothic roofbletson remains to be mentioned who in personand figure was diametrically different fromvol i i woodstockthe other two there was neither foppery norslovenliness in his exterior nor had he anymarks of military service or rank about his persona small walking rapier seemed merely wornas a badge of his rank as a gentleman withouthis hand having the least purpose of becomingacquainted with the hilt or his eye with the bladehis countenance was thin and acute marked withlines which thought rather than age had tracedupon it and a habitual sneer on his countenanceeven when he least wished to express contempt onhis features seemed to assure the person addressedthat in bletson he conversed with a person ofintellect far superior to his own this was a triumphof intellect only for on all occasions of differencerespecting speculative opinions and indeedon all controversies whatsoever bletsonavoided the ultimate ratio of blows and knocksyet this peaceful gentleman had found himselfobliged to serve personally in the parliamentaryarmy at the commencement of the civil war tillhappening unluckily to come in contact with thefiery prince rupert his retreat was judged soprecipitate that it required all the shelter hiswoodstock befriendscould afford to keep him free of an impeachmentor a courtmartial but as bletson spoke wellandwith great effect in the house of commonswhich was his natural sphere and was on that accounthigh in the estimation of his party his behaviourat edgehill was passed over and he continuedto take an active share in all the politicalevents of that bustling period though he facednot again the actual front of warbletsons theoretical principles of politics hadlong inclined him to espouse the opinions ofharrison and others who adopted the visionaryidea of establishing a pure democratical republicin so extensive a country as britain this was arash theory where there is such an infinite differencebetwixt ranks habits education and moralswhere there is such an immense disproportionbetwixt the wealth of individuals and where alarge proportion of the inhabitants consists of theinferior classes of the large towns and manufacturingdistricts men unfitted to bear that sharein the direction of a state which must be exercisedby the members of a republic in the propersense of the word accordingly so soon aswoodstockthe experiment was made it became obvious thatno such form of government could be adoptedwith the smallest chance of stability and thequestion came only to be whether the remnantor as it was vulgarly called the rump of thelong parliament now reduced by the seclusionof so many of the members to a few scores ofpersons should continue in spite of their unpopularityto rule the affairs of britain whetherthey should cast all loose by dissolving themselvesand issuing writs to convoke a new parliamentthe composition of which no one could answer forany more than for the measures they might takewhen assembled or lastly whether cromwellas actually happened was not to throw the swordinto the balance and boldly possess himself ofthat power which the remnant of the parliamentwere unable to hold and yet afraid to resign such being the state of parties the council ofstate in distributing the good things in theirgift endeavoured to soothe and gratify the armyas a beggar flings crusts to a growling mastiffin this view desborough had been createda commissioner in the woodstock matter to grastiny cromwell harrison to soothe the fierce fifthmonarchymen and bletson as a sincere republicanand one of their own leavenbut if they supposed bletson had the least intentionof becoming a martyr to his republicanismor submitting to any serious loss on account of itthey much mistook the man he entertained theirprinciples sincerely and not the less that they werefound impracticable for the miscarriage of hisexperiment no more converts the political speculatorthan the explosion of a retort undeceives analchemist but bletson was quite prepared to submitto cromwell or any one else who might be possessedof the actual authority he was a readysubject in practice to the powers existing and madelittle difference betwixt various kinds of governmentholding in theory all to be nearly equal inimperfection so soon as they diverged from themodel of harrington's oceana cromwell had alreadybeen tampering with him like wax betweenhis finger and thumb and which he was readyshortly to seal with smiling at the same time tohimself when he beheld the council of state givingrewards to bletson as their faithful adherent while woodstockhe himself was secure of his allegiance how soonsoever the expected change of government shouldtake placebut bletson was still more attached to his metaphysicalthan his political creed and carried hisdoctrines of the perfectibility of mankind as far ashedid those respecting the conceivable perfection ofa model of government and as in the one case hedeclared against all power which did not emanatefrom the people themselves so in his moral speculationshe was unwilling to refer any of the phenomenaof nature to a final cause when pushedindeed very hard bletson was compelled to muttersome inarticulate and unintelligible doctrinesconcerning an animus mundi or creative powerin the works of nature by which she originallycalled into existence and still continues to preserveher works to this power he said some of the purestmetaphysicians rendered a certain degree ofhomage nor was he himself inclined absolutely tocensure those who by institution of holidays choraldances songs and harmless feasts and libationsmight be disposed to celebrate the great goddessnature at least dancing singing feasting andwoodstock sporting being comfortable things to both youngand old they might as well sport dance and feastin honour of such appointed holidays as under anyother pretext but then this moderate show of religionwas to be practised under such exceptionsas are admitted by the highgate oath and no onewas to be compelled to dance drink sing or feastwhose taste did not happen to incline them tosuch advertisements nor was any one to be compelledto worship the creative power whether underthe name of the animus mundi or any otherwhatsoever the interference of the deity in theaffairs of mankind he entirely disowned havingproved to his own satisfaction that the idea originatedentirely in priestcraft in short with theshadowy metaphysical exception aforesaid mrjoshua bletson of darlington member for littlecreedcame as near the predicament of an atheistas it is perhaps possible for a man to do butwe say this with the necessary salvo for we haveknown many like bletson whose curtains havebeen shrewdly shaken by superstition though theirfears were unsanctioned by any religious faiththe devils we are assured believe and tremble woodstockbut on earth there are many who in worse plightthan even the natural children of perdition tremblewithout believing and fear even while they blasphemeit follows of course that nothing could betreated with more scorn by mr bletson than thedebates about prelacy and presbytery about presbyteryand independency about quakers and anabaptistsmuggletonians and brownish and all thevarious sects by which the civil war had commencedand by which its dissensions were still continued it was he said as if beasts of burthenshould quarrel amongst themselves about thefashion of their halters and packsaddles insteadof embracing a favourable opportunity of throwingthem aside other witty and pithy remarks heused to make when time and place suited for instanceat the club called the rota frequented bysaint john and established by harrington for thefree discussion of political and religious subjectsbut when bletson was out of this academy orstronghold af philosophy he was very cautious howhe carried his contempt of the general prejudice infavour of religion and christianity further thanwoodstock an implied objection or a sneer if he hm an opportunityof talking in private with an ingenuousand intelligent youth he sometimes attempted tomake a proselyte and showed much address inbribing the vanity of inexperience by suggestingthat a mind like his ought to spurn the prejudicesimpressed upon it in childhood and when assumingthe latus clavus of reason assuring himthat such as he laying aside the bulla of juvenileincapacity as bletson called it should proceed toexamine and decide for himself it frequently happenedthat the youth was induced to adopt thedoctrines in whole or in part of the sage who hadseen his natural genius and who had urged himto exert it in examining detecting and declaringfor himself and thus flattery gave proselytes toinfidelity which could not have been gained byall the powerful eloquence or artful sophistry ofthe infidelthese attempts to extend the influence of whatwas called freethinking and philosophy were carriedon as we have hinted with a caution dictatedby the timidity of the philosopher's dispositionhe was conscious his doctrines were woodstocksuspected and his proceedings watched by thetwo principal sects of relations and presbyterianswho however inimical to each other were still morehostile to one who was an opponent not only to achurch establishment of any kind but to everydenomination of christianity he found it moreeasy to shroud himself among the independentswhose demands were for a general liberty of conscienceor an unlimited toleration and whose faithdiffering in all respects and particulars was bysome pushed into such wild errors as to get totallybeyond the bounds of every species of christianityand approach very near to infidelity itself as extremesof each kind are said to approach eachother bletson mixed a good deal among thosesectaries and such was his confidence in his ownlogic and address that he is supposed to have entertainedhopes of bringing to his opinions in timethe enthusiastic vane as well as the no less enthusiastichanson providing he could but getthem to resign their visions of a fifth monarchyand induce them to be contented with a reign ofphilosophers in england for the natural periodof their lives instead of the reign of the saintskiing the millenniumwoodstock such was the singular group into which everardwas now introduced showing in their variousopinions upon how many devious coasts humannature may make shipwreck when she has one elet go her hold on the anchor which religion hasgiven her to lean upon the acute selfconceit andworldly learning of bletson the rash and ignorantconclusions of the fierce and underbred harrisonleading them into the opposite extremes of enthusiasmand infidelity while desborough constitutionallystupid thought nothing about religion atall and while the others were active in makingsail on different but equally erroneous courseshe might be said to perish like a vessel whichsprings a leak and founders in the roadstead itwas wonderful to behold what a strange varietyof mistakes and errors on the part of the king andhis ministers on the part of the parliament andtheir leaders on the part of the allied kingdoms ofscotland and england towards each other hadcombined to rear up men of such dangerous opinionsand interested characters among the arbitersof the destiny of britainthose who argue for party's sake will sec all the vood stockfaults on the olio side without deigning to look atthose on the other those who study history forinstruction will perceive that nothing but the wantof concession on either side and the deadly heightto which the animosity of the king's and parliamentsparties had arisen could have so totallyoverthrown the wellpoised balance of the englishconstitution but we hasten to quit political reflectionsthe rather that ours we believe willplease neither whig nor torywoodstock chapter xnthree form a college an you give us foiirlet him bring his share with himbeaumont and fletchermb bletson arose and paid his respects tocolonel everard with the ease and courtesy of agentleman of the time though on every accountgrieved at his intrusion as a religious man whoheld his free thinking principles in detestation andwould effectually prevent his conversion of harrisonand even of desborough if anything could bemoulded out of such a clod to the worship of theanimus mundi moreover bletson knew everardto be a man of steady probity and by nomeans disposed to close with a scheme on whichhe had successfully sounded the other two andwhich was calculated to assure the commissioners woodstockof some little private indemnification for the troublethey were to give themselves in the public businessthe philosopher was yet less pleased whenhe saw the magistrate and the pastor who had methim in his flight of the preceding evening whenhe had been seen parma non bene elicta withcloak and doublet left behind himthe presence of colonel everard was as unpleasingto desborough as to bletson but theformer having no philosophy in him nor an ideathat it was possible for any man to resist helpinghimself out of untold money was chiefly embarrassedby the thought that the plunder which theymight be able to achieve out of their trust mightby this unwelcome addition to their number bedivided into four parts instead of three and thisreflection added to the natural awkwardness withwhich he grumbled forth a sort of welcome addressedto everardas for harrison he remained like one onhigher thoughts intent his posture unmoved hiseyes fixed on the ceiling as before and no part ofhim indicated the least consciousness that the companyhad been more than doubled around him woodstock meantime everard took his place at the tableas a man who assumed his own right andpointed to his companions to sit down nearer thefoot of the board wildrake so far misunderstoodhis signals as to sit down above the mayor but rallying his recollection at a look from hispatron he rose and took his place lower whistlinghowever as he went a sound at which thecompany stared as at a freedom highly unbecomingto complete his indecorum he seizedupon a pipe and filling it from a large tobaccoboxwas soon immersed in a cloud of his ownraising from which a hand shortly after emergedseized on the blackjack of ale withdrew it withinthe vapoury sanctuary and after a potentialdraught replaced it upon the table its owner beginningto renew the cloud which his intermittedexercise of the tube had almost allowed to subsidenobody made any observation on his conductout of respect probably to colonel everard whobit his lip but continued silent aware that censuremight extract something more unequivocally chainswoodstock racteristic of a cavalier from his refractory companionas silence seemed too awkward and theothers made no advances to break it beyond theordinary salutation colonel everard at lengthsaid i presume gentlemen that you are somewhatsurprised at my arrival here and thus intrudingmyself into your meetingwhy the dickens should we be surprisedcolonel said desborough we know his excellencymy brotherinlaw noll's i mean mylord cromwell's way of overquartering his meninthe

accordingly and was about to communicatethe contents but observing that there werethree or four halfempty flasks upon the table woodstock sjthat defiborough looked more stupid than usualand that the philosopher's eyes were reeling inhis head notwithstanding the temperance ofbletson's usual habits he concluded that theyhad been fortifying themselves against the horrorsof the haunted mansion by laying in a storeof what is called dutch courage and thereforeprudently'resolved to postpone his more importantbusiness with them till the cooler hour of morninghe therefore instead of presenting the general'swarrant superseding their commission contentedhimself with replying my businesshas of course some reference to your proceedingshere but here is excuse my curiosity a reverend gentleman pointing to holdenoughwho has told me that you are so strangely embarrassedhere as to require both the civil andspiritual authority to enable you to keep possessionof woodstockbefore we go into that

above their breath in the presenceof their betters unless to answer a questionyes colonel everard said the philosopherwith his quiet smile glad apparently to divertthe conversation from the topic of last night'salarm and recollections which humbled his selfloveand selfsatisfaction yes and when masterbibbet and master bibbet do speak their affirmationsare as much in a common mould of mutualattestation as their names would accord m thejiwoodstock verses of a poet if master gibbet happens to tella fiction master bibbet swears it as truth ifmaster bibbet chances to have gotten drunk

the fraternitynot i truly said the cavalier i'll becoupled with no jew that was ever whelped andno jewess neither scorn not for that young man said the philosopher the jews are in point of religionthe elder brethren you knowthe jews older than the christians saiddesborough fore george they will have theebefore the general assembly bletson if thouventures to say sowildrake laughed without ceremony at thegross ignorance of desborough and was joined by woodstocka smuggling response from behind the cupboardwhich when inquired into proved to be producedby the servingmen these worthies timorous astheir betters when they had set down the lightsand were supposed to have left the room had onlyabsconded behind their present place of concealmenthow now ye rogues said bletson angrily do you not know your duty better we beg your worthy honour's pardon saidone of the men but we had set the candlesticksdown on the table and truly we dared not godown stairs till we should get a lighta light ye cowardly poltroons said thephilosopher what to show which of you lookspalest when a rat squeaks but take a candlestickand begone you cowardly villains the devilsyou are so much afraid of must be but paltrykites if they hawk at such bats as you arethe servants without replying took up one ofthe candlesticks and prepared to retreat trustytomkins at the head of the troop when suddenlyas they arrived at the door of the parlour whichhad been left half open it was shut violentlywoodstock the three terrified domestics tumbled back intothe middle of the room as if a shot had been dischargedin their face and all who were at the tablestarted to their feetcolonel everard was incapable of a moment'sfear even if anything frightful had been seen but he remained stationary to see what his companionswould do and to get at the bottom if possibleof the cause of their alarm upon an occasion'so trifling the philosopher seemed to think thathe was the person chiefly concerned to show manhoodon the occasionhe walked to the door accordingly murmuringat the cowardice of the servants but at such asnails pace that it seemed he would most willinglyhave been anticipated by any one whom hisreproaches had roused to exertion cowardlyblockheads he said at last seizing hold of thehandle of the door but without turning it effectuallyround dare you not open a door still fumbling with the lock dare you not godown a staircase without a light here bringme the candle you cowardly villains by heavensomething sighs on the outside woodstockas he spoke he let go the handle of the parlourdoor and stepped back a pace or two into theapartment with cheeks as pale as the band heworedeus adductor mens r said the presbyterianclergyman rising from his seat give placesir addressing bletson it would seem i knowmore of this matter than thou and i bless heaveni am armed for the conflictbold as a grenadier about to mount a breachyet with the same belief in the existence of a greatdanger to be encountered as well as the same reliancein the goodness of his cause the worthy manstepped before the philosophical bletson and takinga light from a sconce in one hand quietlyopened the door with the other and standing inthe threshold said here is nothing iand who expected to see anything saidbletson excepting those terrified oafs who takefright at every puff of wind that whistles throughthe passages of this old dungeon mark you master tomkins said one of thewaitingmen in a whisper to the steward seehow boldly the minister pressed forward beforewoodstock all of them ah master tomkins our parson isthe real commissioned officer of the church yourlaypreachers are no better than a parcel of clubmenand volunteersfollow me those who list said master holdenoughor go before me those who

house as thereare hairs on my head upon this cause i will chargethem up to their very trenches so saying he brandished his weapon and pressedto the head of the column where he moved sideby side with the minister the mayor of woodstocknext joined the body thinking himself saferperhaps in the company of his pastor and thewhole train moved forward in close order accompaniedby the servants bearing lights to searchwoodstockthe lodge for some cause of that panic with whichthey seemed to be suddenly seizednay take me with you my friends saidcolonel everard who had looked on in surpriseand was now about to follow the party when bletsonlaid hold on his cloak and begged him to remainyou see my good colonels he said affectinga courage which his shaking voice beliedhere are only you and i and honest lesbosleft behind in garrison while all the othersare absent on a sally we must not hazard thewhole troops in one sortie that were unmilitaryha ha ha iin the name of heaven what means all this said everard i heard a foolish tale about apparitionsas i came this way and now i find youall half mad with fear and cannot get a word ofsense among so many of you fie colonel desborough fie master bletson try to composeyourselves and let me know in heaven's namethe cause of all this disturbance one would beapt to think your brains were turned and so mine well may said desboroughwoodstock ay and overturned too since my bed last nightwas turned upside down and i was placed for tenminutes heels uppermost and head downcast likea bullock going to be shodwhat means this nonsense master bletson desborough must have had the nightmare no faith colonel the goblins or whateverelse they were had been favourable to honest desboroughfor they reposed the whole of his personon that part of his body which hark did younot hear something sis the central point of gravitynamely his headdid you see anything to alarm you saidthe colonelnothing said bletson but we heard hellishnoises as all our people did and i believinglittle of ghosts and apparitions concluded the cavalierswere taking us at advantage so rememberinggainsborough's fate i e'en jumped thewindow and ran to woodstock to call the soldiersto the rescue of harrison and desboroughand did you not first go to see what the dangerwas ah my good friend you forget that i laidwoodstockdown my commission at the time of the selfdenyingordinance it would have been quite inconsistentwith my duty as a parliamentman to bebrawling amidst a set of ruffians with any militaryauthority no when the parliament commandedme to sheathe my sword colonel i have toomuch veneration for their authority to be foundagain with it drawn in my handbut the parliament said desborough hastily did not command you to use your heelswhen your hands could have saved a man fromchoking gods dickens you might have stoppedwhen you saw my bed canted heels uppermostand me half stifled in the bedclothes you mighti say have stopped and lent a hand to put it torights instead of jumping out of window like anew shorn sheep so soon as you had run acrossmy roomnay worshipful master desborough saidbletson winking on everard to show that he wasplaying on his thickskulled colleague how couldi tell your particular mode of reposing thereare many tastes i have known men who slept bychoice on a slope or angle of fortyfives'woodstock yes but did ever a man sleep standing onhis head except by miracle said desborough now as to miracles said the philosopherconfident in the presence of everard besides thatan opportunity of scoffing at religion really in somedegree diverted his fear i leave these out ofthe question seeing that the evidence on suchsubjects seems as little qualified to carry convictionas a horsehair to land a leviathana loud clap of thunder or a noise as formidablerang through the lodge as the scoffer hadended which struck him pale and motionless andmade desborough throw himself on his knees andrepeat exclamations and prayers in much admiredconfusionthere must be contrivance here exclaimedeverard and snatching one of the candles froma sconce he rushed out of the apartment littleheeding the entreaties of the philosopher who inthe extremity of his distress conjured him by theanimus mundi to remain to the assistance of adistressed philosopher endangered by witchesand a parliamentman assaulted by ruffians asfor desborough he only gaped like a clown in a woodstockpantomime and doubtful whether to follow orstop his natural indolence prevailed and he satstillwhen on the landingplace of the stairs everardpaused a moment to consider which was thebest course to take he heard the voices of mentalking fast and loud like people who wish to drowntheir fears in the lower story and aware that nothingcould be discovered by those whose inquirieswere conducted in a manner so noisy he resolvedto proceed in a different direction and examinethe second floor which he had now gainedhe had known every corner both of the inhabitedand uninhabited part of the mansionand availed himself of the candle to traverse twoor three intricate passages which he was afraidhe might not remember with sufficient accuracythis movement conveyed him to a sort of oeuildebeiif an octagon vestibule or small hall fromwhich various rooms opened amongst thesedoors everard selected that which led to a verylong narrow and dilapidated gallery built in thetime of henry viii and running along the wholesouthwest side of the building communicating atwoodstock different points with the rest of the mansion thishe thought was likely to be the post occupied bythose who proposed to act the sprites upon the occasion especially as its length and shape gave himsome idea that it was a spot where the bold thundermight in many ways be imitateddetermined to ascertain the truth if possible heplaced his light on a table in the vestibule andapplied himself to open the door into the galleryat this point he found himself strongly opposedeither by a bolt drawn or as he rather conceivedby somebody from within resisting his attempthe was induced to believe the latter because theresistance slackened and was renewed like that ofhuman strength instead of presenting the permanentopposition of an inanimate obstacle thougheverard was a strong and active young man heexhausted his strength in the vain attempt to openthe door and having paused to take breath wasabout to renew his efforts with foot and shoulderand to call at the same time for assistance whento his surprise on again attempting the door moregently in order to ascertain if possible where thestrength of the opposing obstacle was situated hei woodstockfound it give way to a very slight impulse someimpediment fell broken to the ground and thedoor flew wide open the gust of wind occasionedby the sudden opening of the door blew outthe candle and everard was left in darknesssave where the moonshine which the long siderowof latticed windows dimmed could imperfectlyforce its way into the gallery which lay inghostly length before himthe melancholy and doubtful twilight was increasedby a quantity of creeping plants on theoutside which since all had been neglected inthese ancient halls now completely overgrown hadin some instances greatly diminished and in othersalmost quite choked up the space of the latticesextending between the heavy stone shaftworkwhich divided the windows both lengthways andacross on the other side there were no windowsat all and the gallery had been once completelyhung with paintings chiefly portraits by whichthat side of the apartment had been adornedmost of the pictures had been removed yet theempty frames of some and the tattered remnantsof others were still visible along the extent ofwoodstock sosthe waste gallery the look of which was so desolateand so well adapted besides for mischiefsupposing there were enemies near him that everardcould not help pausing at the entrance andrecommending himself to god ere drawing hissword he advanced into the apartment treadingas lightly as possible and keeping in the shadowas much as he couldmarkham everard was by no means superstitiousbut he had the usual credulity of his times and though he did not yield easily to tales of supernaturalvisitations yet he could not help thinkinghe was in the very situation where if suchthings were ever permitted they might be expectedto take place while his own stealthy andill assured pace his drawn weapon and extendedarms being the very attitude and action of doubtand suspicion tended to increase in his mind thegloomy feelings of which they are the usual indicationsand with which they are constantly associatedunder such unpleasant impressions andconscious of the neighbourhood of something unfriendlycolonel everard had already advancedabout half along the gallery when he heard somey woodstockone sigh very near him and a low soft voice pronouncehis namehere i am he replied while his heart beatthick and short who calls on markham everardtanother sigh was the only answer speak said the colonel whoever or whatsoeveryou are and tell with what intent and purposeyou are lurking in these apartments with a better intent than yours returnedthe soft voicethan mine answered everard in greatsurprise who are you that dare judge of myintents what or who are you markham everardwho wander by moonlight through these desertedhalls of royalty where none should be but thosewho mourn their downfall or are sworn to avengeit it is and yet it cannot be said everard yet it is and must be alice lee the devil oryou speaks answer me i conjure you speakopenly on what dangerous scheme are you engaged where is your father why are you herewoodstock wherefore do you run so deadly a venture speak i conjure you alice lee she whom you call on is at the distance ofmiles from this spot what if her genius speakswhen she is absent what if the soul of an ancestressof hers and yours were now addressingyou what if nay answered everard but what if thedearest of human beings has caught a touch ofher father's enthusiasm what if she is exposingher person to danger her reputation toscandal by traversing in disguise and in darknessa house filled with armed men speak tomemy fair cousin in your own person i amfurnished with powers to protect my uncle sirhenry to protect you too dearest alice evenagainst the consequences of this visionary andwild attempt speak i see where you are andwith all my respect i cannot submit to be thuspractised upon trust me trust your cousinmarkham with your hand and believe that hewill die or place you in honourable safetyas he spoke he exercised his eyes as keenly aspossible to detect where the speaker stood andvol i u woodstockit seemed to him that about three ytirds from himthere was a shadowy form of which he could notdiscern even the outline placed as it was within thedeep and prolonged shadow thrown by a space ofwall intervening betwixt two windows upon thatside of the room from which the light was admittedhe endeavoured to calculate as well as hecould the distance betwixt himself and the objectwhich he watched under the impression that ifby even using a slight degree of compulsion hecould detach his beloved alice from the confederacyinto which he supposed her father's zeal forthe cause of royalty had engaged her he wouldbe rendering them both the most essential favourhe could not indeed but conclude that howeversuccessfully the plot which he conceived to be inagitation had proceeded against the timid bletsonthe stupid desborough and the crazy harrisonthere was little doubt that at length their artificesmust necessarily bring shame and danger on thoseengaged in itit must also be remembered that everard's affectionto his cousin although of the most respectfuland devoted character partook less of the diswoodstockwant veneration which a lover of those days entertainedfor the lady whom he worshipped withhumble diffidence than of the fond and familiarfeelings which a brother entertains towards ayounger sister whom he thinks himself entitledto guide advise and even in some degree to controlso idndly and intimate had been their intercoursethat he had little more hesitation in endeavouringto arrest her progress in the dangerouscourse in which she seemed to be engaged evenat the risk of giving her momentary offence thanhe would have had in snatching her from a torrentor conflagration at the chance of hurting her bythe violence of his grasp all this passed throughhis mind in the course of a single minute and heresolved at all events to detain her on the spotand compel if possible an explanation from herwith this purpose everard again conjured hiscousin in the name of heaven to give up this idleand dangerous mummery and lending an accurateear to her answer endeavoured from the soundto calculate as nearly as possible the distance betweenthemi am not she for whom you take me said woodstockthe voice and dearer regards than aught connectedwith her life or death bid me warn you tokeep aloof and leave this place'not till i have convinced you of your childishfolly said the colonel springing forward andendeavouring to catch hold of her who spoke tohim but no female form was within his graspon the contrary he was met by a shock whichcould come from no woman's arm and which wasrude enough to stretch him on his back on thefloor at the same time he felt the point of asword at his throat and his hands so completelymastered that not the slightest defence remainedto him a cry for assistance said a voice near himbut not that which he had hitherto heard will bestifled in your blood no harm is meant you be wise and be silentthe fear of death which everard had oftenbraved in the field of battle became more horribleas he felt himself in the hands of unknown assassinsand totally devoid of all means of defencethe sharp point of the sword pricked his barethroat and the foot of him who held it was uponwoodstock his breast he felt it was to be a single thrustand an end there would be of life and all the feverishjoys and sorrows which agitate us so strangelyand from which we are yet so reluctant to partlarge drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead this heart throbbed as if it would burst fromits confinement in the bosom she experienced theagony which fear imposes on the brave man acutein proportion to that which pain inflicts when itsubdues the robust and healthycousin alice he attempted to speak andthe sword's point pressed his throat yet moreclosely cousin let me

words dying away as at a distance thouart free be secret and be safemarkham everard arose and in rising embarrassedhis feet with his own sword which hehad dropped when springing forward as he supposedto lay hold of his fair cousin he snatchedit up in haste and as his hand clasped the hilthis courage which had given way under the apprehensionof instant death began to return heconsidered with almost his usual composurewhat was to be done next deeply affronted at thewoodstock disgrace which he had sustained he questionedfor an instant whether he ought to keep his extortedpromise or should not rather summon assistanceand make haste to discover and seizethose who had been recently engaged in such violenceon his person but these persons be theywho they would had had his life in their power he had pledged his word in ransom of it andwhat was more he could not divest himself of theidea that his beloved alice was a confidante atleast if not an actor in the confederacy whichhad thus baffled him this prepossession determinedhis conduct for though angry at supposingshe must have been accessary to his personalilltreatment he could not in any event think ofan instant search through the mansion which mighthave committed her safety or that of his unclebut i will to the hut he said i will instantlyto the hut ascertain her share in this wildand dangerous confederacy and snatch her fromruin if it be possibleas under the influence of the resolution whichhe had formed everard groped his way throughthe gallery and regained the vestibule he heard woodstockhis name called by the wellknown voice of wild rake what ho houo colonel everardmark everard it is dark as the devil's mouthspeak where are you the witches are keepingtheir hellish sabbath here as i think whereare
