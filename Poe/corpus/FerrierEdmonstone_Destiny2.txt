fill of selfupbraiding thathe had not set off on the first accounts of hiscousin's illness he said he never could forgivehimself for having been absent at such a time but he was just setting off for

kissedher cheek but while he did so tears burst fromhis eyes the hearts of both were too fullfor utterance a spell seemed upon their lipsand they remained in deep and silent emotionyet an unconcerned spectator would have remarkedthat sir reginald's embarrassment wasequal to his emotion and that something morethan sorrow struggled in his bosom and choakedhis utterance but edith was too much underthe influence of powerful feeling herself to be anice observer of what was passing in the mindof another her tears continued to flow fromthe mingled tide of grief and joy which swelledher hearta

too late said he bitterlyno no dear reginald do not say so westill need your sympathy her voice faulteredand iain her tears fell a sigh almost a groan broke from sir reginald's heart he rose andtraversed the apartment then resumed his seatand leaning his head on a table tears forced theirway through the fingers which shaded his browbut again he roused himself and strove to speakcalmly and

tomorrow and seethetrees marked and edith is there no wordof that molly macauley yet in this sort of bald disjointed chat the eveningwore heavily away without the lovers havingan opportunity of conversing for an instantapart for glenroy would not suffer reginald tostir from his side and seemed even loath to losesight of him when they separated for the night destinychapter ivhitherto edith had felt chilled and disappointedreginald it was true had been soengrossed by her father that it had not been inhis power to devote himself to her but he hadnot even looked as if he wished it his air hadbeen sad and abstracted and only once had sheseen his eye kindle with its wonted fire andthat was at the mention of lord allonby as herlover the report had gone abroad thoughwithout foundation that he was an accepted oneand it might have reached reginald and henceall the mystery he had been piqued angryjealous and her father's words had merely conveyedthe impression that she had rejected him asasuitor but could reginald then have believedher capable even in thought of breaking herplighted faith and renouncing herrst her onlydestiny love and would he have yielded her up to a rivalwithout a word yes generous and highmindedas he was he would have disdained to remonstratebut o show he must have despised her andedith's cheek burned even at the thought thenthe strange expressions in his letter his unaccountabledelay in returning his agitation at meetinglus abstracted and gloomy airwereall these to be referred to the same source yespartly to that and partly to the mournful circumstancesunder which they had met the lossof norman the infirmities of her fitter bothin mind and body must have shocked one whohad so much cause to love him as reginald hadand thus edith strove to soothe her woundedfeelings and bar her breast against the admissionof doubts worse than death but all thesereflections did not enable her to meet her loverwith that easy artless confidence of mannerwhich had formerly rendered their intercourse sodelightful when they met at the breakfasttablethere was mutual embarrassment reginaldseemed less sad indeed than on the precedingevening but still there was none of that destinygaiety and playfulness of manner which hadbeen so often wont to call up the smiles on hercheek his manners were all elegance andsuavity but they lacked the affectionate warmthof former days and though his countenance wasmore than ever expressive of the fire and sensibilityof his mind still no bright or tender glancerepeated the ofttold tale of fond happy youthfulaffection the kind sweet smile of oldthe conversation or rather talk was carriedon by glenroy in the same strain of mingledpride vanity lamentation and tautology therewas all the detail of the premiums and the dhumoss and the account of the new plantationsgreatly enlarged and the anticipation of thethinning with the purpose for which they wereto be applied and then came the black mareand lord allonby and at the mention of hisname reginald who had been sunk in a reveriesuddenly started and again cast on editha look which seemed as if it would have piercedinto her soul and again the blood mounted toher temples at the suspicion it impliedi hope edith you will be of our party todestiny glenhaussen said he gaily what a charmingmorning this is i have been little in the practice of ridingfor some time replied she and am becomesuch a timid horsewoman that i fear i shouldonly be an encumbrance where is it we're going reginald criedglenroy o aye to look at the glenhaufrsen woods but what would take her there riding's not the thing for a lady lord allonbythaf s he thaf wants the black mare thaf iwas talking about he courted edith too thatbelonged to my norman as if i would

speaking about ridings what destinywas it for i don't know what i am about not that if s your fault reginald but edith youreally have not ben yourself since that puppylord allonby put nonsense in your headpoor edith was aghast at this accusationaccustomed as she was to the capricious garrulityof her ther's temper but the set wasglenroy by one of the inexplicable contradictionsof nature even while indulging his spleenin chiding and censuring his daughter soughtat the same time to give her consequence in theeyes of his nephew by perpetually adverting tothe noble and wealthy suitor who had courtedher alliance reginald seemed to feel for herconsio for taldng her hand he said with alook of almost fond entreaty come now edithdon't refuse my first request do go with us i will said edith softly if you reallywish it can you doubt it replied reginald in thesame tonebut glenroy seemed so bent on monopolizinghis nephew's company and conversation as todestiny grudge even a portion of it to his daughter forhe said peevishly if s not a woman's businesswe're going about we're going to look at theglenhaussen woods are we not slegmaidthen what can she know about the thinning ofwoodshhe knows enough when she knows she'sto have them or her tocher and not a bad meeither reginald mcintosh tells me seven diottsand pounds worth will never be missedsandas many more as you like but i'll be

you like and you shall havethe first thousand of the cuttings to buy yourwedding trumpery and you'll get that fool mollymacauley to help you what the plague's comeover the creature reginald said nothing but his countenance wasovercast and when edith rose from the breakfasttable he neither repeated his request nor remindedher of her promise but as she was leaving theb bfistinyroom she heard him say with quickness therecan be no hurry as to marking the trees glenroy and if but here glenroy with hisusual impatience of contradiction broke in nohurry but i tell you there is a hurry reginaldand if it had not been for norman's death whichi shall never get the better of here a passionateburst of grief concluded the sentenceand edith only learnt how the discussion hadended when n hour afterwards she saw herfitter and lover ride off without herthat reginald was piqued and jealous shethought was now certain for how could she otherwiseaccount for such capricious inequalitiesfrom the moment of his arrival her mind hadbeen in too great a tremor to admit of her markingaccurately the sudden changes of his manner if she had she would have drawn a very differentinference edith's feelings were all too pureand devoted to allow her enjoying any womanishtriumph at this supposed discovery on the contraryher gentle guileless heart was pained at thethought that she was the cause of uneasiness todestiny reginald a few words from her lips she wassure would instantly remove it and she thereforeresolved to take the first opportunity of comingto an explanation with him and of undeceivinghim as to her fancied predilection for another destinychapter vbut it seemed as if reginald avoided all opportunitiesof being alone with her when heretiuned from his ride he withdrew to his ownapartment on the plea of having letters to write and when he appeared at dinner his air was stillmore melancholy and abstracted than it had yetbeen two or three chance visitors who hadarrived rendered the conversation rather moregeneral and by their county news divertedglenroy's attention from being quite so exclusivelydirected to his nephew though every subjectthat was started still bore some referenceto him to the dhu moss the planting of skirridale hill the thinning of the glenhaussen woodsthe highland society the black mare normanand lord allonbystint sedith flattered herself when she left the diningroomthat reginald would boon follow her sheknew he disliked sitting long at table and theparty was not one to be upon any ceremony with her father had a habit of remaining long afterdinner and as he became drowsy and confused itwould be an easy matter for reginald to makehis escape from him but she waited in vain reginald came not but soon she caught aglimpse of him from the window as he dollycrossed the lawn and disappeared in the woodsthat skirted it on one side edith could notrestrain her tears at this new proof of reginald'sestrangement from her oh cruel that he is thought she thus to torture himself and me could he act thus if he loved pie as i love him no no surely he would seek an explanationand end this mystery and yet it is i who maybeunjust this snored mystery may be nothingmore than grief and selfreproach and he isunwilling to give me pain by communicating hisfeelings ah did he but know how sweet itwould be to me to share in his every sorrow hewould not thus withhold them from me pestinythus did edith mournfully commune withherself till the evening was far advanced whenshe was roused by the sound of an arrival andin a few minutes mrs macauley's jocund tonessaluted her ear and presently she entered allbustle calling so he's come where is he let me see him then suddenly stopping butbless my heart my dear she exclaimed as shesurveyed

reginaldentered the room she flew towards himand precipitated herself round his neck utteringexpressions of joy and delight which were returnedon his part with all the hearty warmth andardour of his

myself too much of a frenchman todispense with my coffee said sir reginaldseemingly relieved by the delay while edith leftthe room for her shawl i really think that sweet creature's lookingvery ill said mrs macauley ip a low voice tosir reginald after dismissing boyd and hissatellite i thought the sight of you wouldhave brought back the roses to her cheeks and thesmiles to her pretty mouth but i

emotionwell my dear but don't you be frightenedfor all that and she'll soon be as pretty as evershe was for she has a very good constitutionalthough maybe she does not look so stout assome of your great big fat people and youknow it is natural for her to be looking not sowell considering what distress she has suffered and then you know she was so anxious aboutyou and so wearying for you to come home in spite of lord allonby said sir reginaldwith a forced laugh o so you have heard about that already but it would not be from miss edith herself forshe does not like the way glenroy speaks aboutthat at allsir reginald remained silent for a few momentsas if struggling with his emotion thendestiny sipping his coffee he said with affected carelessness ladies seldom dislike having their conquestsknown and my cousin has no cause to beashamed of hers deed i think not for lord allonby is avery fine handsome man though he has no clan he has a very good fortune too they tell methough it

you of her own accord afterstaying so long away from you of all the wonderfulthings fve met with and i have met witha good many in my day this is the most extraordinaryi see nothing in the least extraordinary inthe matter said glenroy with dignified composureo that must be because you are so wisedestiny glenroy for i have heard that very wise peopleare never surprised at any thing which i thinkvery extraordinary considering what curiouscreatures we are and what wonderful things wemeet with both by day and by night it wasbut just the night before last i had such a curiousdream but i'm not going to tell it to youglenroy as she saw a volley ready to burstforth though i must always think it veryuncommon that i should have dreamed such adream at the very time your lady was comingback to you tm sure i hope she will behaveherself nowbehave herself repeated glenroy wrathfully i wish mrs macauley you would learnto behave yourself and not give your tonguesuch a licensewell what did i say was wrong thereglenroy for deed i do not think she behavedso discreetly as she might have done to youbut now that she has seen her fault to be sure weshould not speak about what's past and i daresayshe will make you a good and an obedientand a wellbehaved wife in all times to come destinyfor mice she somewhere i doiibt if she'll be forgang away again deed i wondered at herleaving yon when she dii and what right had you to wonder anythingabout it mrs macaulay and wher wasthe wonder of her going to look after her daughter'sfortune at the time she did she acted tikea sensible prudent woman and now that jhas secured that and got the girl properly educatedthe first thing she does is to show herrespect for me by bringing her back to me buti daresay one reasoiki et hec leaving this wmthat the child might not be corrupted by youyou would have been a fit person to have educateda peeress to be sure you've made a firehand of edith to be sureo fie glenroy cried mrs macauleykindling a tittle at these aspersions i wonderto hear you deed i don't think it sets youto speak in that disparaging way of your owndaughter and her so sweet and pretty and genteeland so much admired and i wonder youshould set up the other one considering whata tittle spoilt impudent monkey she was anddestiny is'deed i don't beuereshe's much better yet foryou see sir reginald has never said a goodword of her and i really think he cannot bearthe name of her you're an old goose molly macauley anddon't know what you are speaking about iasked reginald if he had any fault to find withher and he said none in the world and he saidas much as that they had been upon a goodenough footing when they met and i know itwas only his fear of their disturbing me thatmade him unwilling to admit them here for hethinks more of me than any of you i know thatand he's everything to me now so take youcare mrs macaxdey that you behave yourselfproperly o glenroy as if ever i could behave myselfimproperly to anybody especially to yourlady and your stepdaughter i'm sure i shallput my best foot foremost to please them andi just thinking what little marks ot my requesti can contrive for them that will be

prevailed upon to take anight's quarters and spend a day or two withhis old friend dross at lochdhu and that ashewas now so eu on his way to dunshiera hewould probably visit it before his return hetherefore desired his servant and horses mightjoin him the following morning and beggededidi would write him a line to say how glenixestikt roy was c ah this was quite natural andyet with felt a little mortified that reginaldshould voluntarily absent himself from her evenfor a few days it might be chiefly on her accountindeed as it was probably a mere excuse to gito dunshiera with a view to prepare it for herreception and she was angry with herself forthe momentary chagrin she had given way toshe wrote him a few lines in reply and told himwhat answer had been returned to lady wadegrave's letter by her father's desire then addeda hope that he would not be long absent and arequest that he would do nothing to dunshieraon her accountthere was of course a violent storm fromglenroy when he heard of his nephew's departsture but upon the whole he bore it better thancould have been expected the act was therewas always some one subject that reigned paramountin his mind and fegaii to weary

assistmadeand edith wrote a hurried line to ireginald informing him of her father's situationskua had heard from him from dunshiera whoseliesaid he had found so much to do that i destinytime of his return was uncertain but the intelligenceof his uncle's danger she was sure wouldbring him instantly to glenroy and so it preyedfor he lost not a moment in answering thesummons but before either he or the doctorarrived the disorder had taken a favourable turnthe gout had resumed its station in the feetunis the danger was past for the time and glenroywas himself again and every thing and everybodyresumed their former station and occupationreginald alone seemed restless and uneasy abrupt in his answers and unequal in hisspirits but whenever he caught edith's eye heinstantly rallied recovered his selfpossessionand began to talk to her ef dunshiera of all hewas doing and had to do for her comfort andaccommodation and would then urge the necessitythere was for returning there having numerousworkpeople waiting his orders but as themention pf such a purpose always threw glenroyinto an absolute paroxysm and made himgout all over he at length agreed to remainwhere he was until his uncle's health shouldtye more firmly reestablisheddestiny you surely do not think of receiving ladyelizabeth now said he to edith one day whenshe was expressing her expectation of a letterfrom lady waldegraveno i scarcely expect them now said she as i wrote to florinda when papa was takenill but if they had set out of course she couldnot have received my letter however i musthear from her soon as she will at all events writeto apprize me of the day of their arrival if theyare really coming if they should come said reginald in atone of affected composure i shall take advantageof your having such good company to returnto dunshiera for a few days glenroy will probablybe quite well by that time and i am anxiousto forward the operationssurely reginald you will not think ofleaving us

quicklyi can scarcely believe you said she whatcan your motive be for so strange a proposal in the first place said he i feel that ihave been long enough exhibited as your loverin the next we should avoid the intolerableeclat which always attends on these things andlastly he added with a sort of mocking airsince your father is going to be reunited tohis lady love tis to be supposed he will be toohappy to be dependent upon other society andconsequently he could more easily spare us what have i said to offend you edith hecontinued quickly as she remained silent andthe tears swelled in her eyesdestiny much said she with emotion and yeti am sure you did not mean to hurt me reginaldshe added tenderly if you are hurt the fault must be your ownnot mine said reginald coldlyedith's tears fell

shewas accustomed to the querulous faultfindingof her father and from that and other evils shehad been wont to find a refuge in the tendernessof reginald but this burst of displeasure wastoo much for her and she wept in meek andsent anguish while he paced the room with theair of one who would rather be still more exasperatedthan mollified at that moment benbowie entered the roomand was making up to sir reginald with anopen letter and beginning something about commissionersof supply when hastily brushing pasthim with an air of reckless hauteur he quittedthe apartment at the same time the

mildness of mrs malcolm's manner peculiarlydignified and unaffected she appeared whollyforgetful self and strong in the native elegantsimplicity of a mind which diffused itself overher whole bearing and deportment qui etolt de tost temps et de toutes modesof all the modifications of manner which areto be met with in society perhaps the mostgenerally pleasing is simplicity even as thatwater is the purest which has no taste that airthe freshest which has no odour such was theimpression which mrs malcolm's manner generallyproduced on all whose hearts were still aliveto the charms of nature as even the most sophisttreated unconsciously feel subdued beneath thebland influence of native goodness since theloss'of her son mrs malcolm's manner had everretained a still more pensive chastened castthan had formerly characterized it and her palebrow tender and gravely sweet still worea look of days gone by this was the firstdestiny time she had seen sir reginald since his returnand for a moment the tide of sad recollectionrushed over her heart as she thought such asheis might my ronald now have been butsoon the emotion died away beneath the habitualresignation of her soul the cloud passed fromher mild brow and pale cheek as she regained her usual serenitymrs malcolm was neither a bigot nor zealotbut she could not avoid seeing how the day sosacred in her estimation was disregarded anddegraded by those whom she was now among and her eye rested more in sorrow than in angerdn the frivolous occupations they were engagedin it is so long since i have seen you mrsmalcolm said edith surveying her with looksof gladness that i scarcely know where tobegin with my enquiries it is indeed a long while since we have metjsaid mrs malcolm but though i seldom gofrom home now yet had i known of the arrivalof lady elizabeth malcolm and lady landgravei should have taken an earlier opportunity destinyof waiting upon them not this day certainlyfor i came for a different purpose i could notthink of passing your door without asking youto accompany us to your church there is noservice in our own today and our good friendmr stewart is to officiate in the absence ofmr mdowi shall go with much pleasure said edith j and perhaps others in company may also jointhe partycertainly said lady waldegrave withone of her most winning looks i shall be toohappy to be allowed to accompany yougoing to church cried lady elizabethwho being tired of spilickins here joined theconversation very proper i approve ofgoing to church i think it quite right absolutelynecessary for the sake of example to the lowerorders of the peopleif it is proper for the lower orders saidmrs malcolm gently it must be equally sofor the higherby no means replied lady elizabethdestiny warmly it is quite a different thing it i verywell known that in this country the cotnnumpeople do require to go to church it is differentabroad though even there they attend mass veryregularly but then you know that is soon averand they have a thousand innocent ways of themselves and spending the day which thepeople here have no idea of they have operateand theatres and dancing and all srts of prettyharmless amusements it is many years since i waa on the contirents said mrs malcolm in the same gentlemanner and therefore i am perhaps scarcelyentitled to speak of the customs that prevailthere now but at that time i confess my feelkings were hurt at witnessing what appeared tomethe profanation of a day associated in mymind with all that is solent and sacredof course on going from our own countrywe carry our prejudices along with us said sirreginald and we are scandalized at seeingour neighbours with happy eues on a day whenwe have always been accustomed to measure destinyour piety by the length and solemnity of ourown ah excellent i excellent exclaimed madamelatour que ce mot solemn me faitfrksonner w i mrhy yes i don't think it is a good thingto be too solemn observed lady elizabethwith the air of a solon it defeats the objectsand and in short i don't think it answers i am sorry i should have used a word whichhas so many unpleasing ideas attached to itsaid mrs malcolm sweetly but in my mindsolemnity is not necessarily associated with gloomor melancholy there is a solemn stillness in theair of the sabbath which conveys to me ideasof the most pleasurable kind it seems to combineau the tamquiluty and repose of the nightwith the light and gladness of the day mais pourquoi you formed dans cette contrtoute demonstration de joie enquired madamelatour i know nd demonstrations of rational joythat are forbidden replied mrs malcolm thedestiny mere excess of animal spirits certainly does notharmonize with the day given for nobler pmwponies but there may be and i am sure there ismuch quiet heartfelt homefelt happiness on thatday i know no more pleasurable sight thanthat of our own poor people in their clean dresseswith cheerful though sedate faces assemblingtogether to hear the glad tidings which tell themof peace and hope and love mais la danse et la musique par exemplevous les regardez comme des pchs mortelschfiz nous elles sont les demonstrations de notrejoie de notre reconnaissance de notre amourde dieu and madame latour raised her eyesin a pretended ecstasy of devotionwhere such feelings are truly producedand bring forth corresponding fruits we shouldcertainly be cautious how we condemn themeans replied captain malcolm as someonehas well said virtuous action is all the realworth of intelligent being but in this land wehave no reason to expect that music and dancingshould lead to the knowledge of god and destinythe practice of piety even splendid rites have'been found both useless and pernicious in alludingthe mind away from the doctrines and preceptsof the gospel which are addressed to theheart and the understanding not the senses surely every one must allow nothing canbe more effectual in kindling devotional feelingthan fine music said sir reginaldundoubtedly replied captain malcolm fine music is the very luxury of devotion butit js one that is far beyond the reach of the massof the people where could our poor highlandersprocure fine music you forget die bagpipe and its accompanimentthe whisky bottle said sir reginald sarcastically the fiddle and the vin du pays may bemore refined modes of enjoyment said captainmalcolm but refinement of taste does notnecessarily imply corresponding improvement inmorals i have not indeed lived long enoughin a catholic country to be altogether a fair judgeof the practical effects of the romish religion ondestiny the morals f the people but of one thing i amvery sure that the sincere followers of that religionenjoy much less liberty spiritual and temporalthan we do were we to reckon up thenumber of holidays saints days fists vigilspenances prayers c c from one year's endto e other i suspect it would be found that amuch larger portion of time is devoted to reliespious observances amongst catholics than protestantswere we therefore to annul or evencurtail our one day in seven little or nothingwould remain to remind us ofthe tie subsistingbetween god and his creatures that is very good exclaimed lady elizabeth penances are to be sure shocking thingsand we protestants ought as mr maloofansays to oppose them by every means in ourpowerand we ought also to set a good exampleto the lower orders i shall go to church herselftoday with an air of dignified virtue andif you will allow me i will take a seat in yourcarriages to captain malcolm whom she hadjust discovered to be a very fineeokiiig gentlemanlyman and being a great enthusiast in destintbeauty his looks were at ojace a passport to hexgood gracesthe offer was of course accepted the firstcarriage drove off while the other for floridaand edith was getting ready edith had beenhurt at the slighting way in which reginaldhad spoken of the religious observances of theircountry for although she herself entered butlittle into the true spirit of christianity shenevertheless possessed that reverence for itsinstitutions and symbols which with manypasses for religion itselfwhen the carriage drove up sir reginaldwas on the hallsteps ready to hand lady landgraveand edith in madame latour being acatholic of course did not accompany them i flattered myself you would have escortedflorinda and me to church reginald saidedith reproachfully you forget that i am half a catholic saidhe smilingedith gave an unconscious look of affrightfrom him to madame latour who was standingalso on the steps reginald seemed to read whatdestiny was passing in her mind and the careless scornfill smile he gave in return at once reassuredher while he added that is according to thenotions of presbyterians but however if youare not afraid after what has passed to admituh a reprobate within the walls of your lankyi shall join you there edith i shall take the cutacross benvarloch and be there as soon as youis it possible then to walk to church enquired lady waldegrave quite possible for highlanders such asreginald and i answered edith but quiteimpossible i should imagine for you horinda what a stimulus that word impossible issaid lady waldegrave especially when oneknows it is quite possible as i am resolved toprove how i love to overcome possible impossibilities come if i should fag by the waysome of your good highland ferries will i amsure take pity on me and bring me a pair ofgolden patterns or some such aid as will enableme to climb with perfect ease to the very pinnacleof your mountain tops and in spite of allremonstrance her ladyship persisted in walkingvol ii l destinythe carriage was therefore dismissed emptyand the party set outsir reginald as a matter of course offered anarm to each of his companions but lady landgravecoldly declined and he did not repeat theoffer there was something so whimsical andcapricious in florinda's behaviour that edithcould not bithom it she had volunteered eveninsisted upon taking a long walk with a personfrom whom she yet would not accept the mostcommon act of civility what could be themeaning of such mutual unvarying coldness andeven dislike lady waldegrave might have read what waspassing in edith's mind on her artless yet eloquentcountenance but lady waldegrave wasone of those who are too much engrossed by selfto pay much attention to the thoughts and feelingsof others aimless when exacting a tribute ofadmiration or adulation for a considerablepart of the way the road lay through the beautifuland extensive pleasuregrounds where everchanginglandscapes of wild alpine sceneryrocks and woods knolls and dells blue lake anddestiny stridingriver alternately mingled with the softerfeatures of culture and ornament the pomp of groves

fills with beauty the land of mountainsand imparts to every feature a grandeur and agrace which sinks into insipidity the riches andthe beauty of the fairest champaignit seemed as if the gloom of

whollysilent as if absorbed in some strong concentratedfeeling edith was surprised and mortifiedat time indifference and even inattention withwhich rotunda regarded the sublime sceneryaround them as they climbed the steep sideof the mountain they sometimes stopped to recoverbreath and on one occasion as they lookeddown from the almost dizzy height on whichthey stood to the dreary glen below edithpointing to a wretched and almost imperceptiblehovel with its peatstack and its potatoes patchsaid look there florinda that is a humandwelling and do you know i am so piqued atthe indifference

feelingsof my heart before you i did not concealfrom you that an obstacle then stood in the wayof my happiness i could not bear to name it toyou but it was one i scattered myself i shouldbe able to remove i trusted that time andabsence would have wrought the same change inher that had taken place in me and that the taskwould be an easy one to break the ties we soprematurely formed it has not proved so sheloves me still still ah do not scorn her affectionflorinda it is i am sure such as she isherself tender and sincere but even laid itbeen less so even were it far otherwise from thedbtuiy

glenroy i stammeredreginald violently agitatedstances that it never occurred to her to dissembleor give it any false glosses to serve atemporary purpose but she always spoke it witha sympathy and tenderness which usually disturned it of its bitterest sting but it was notfrom the fiery unregulated mind of sir reginaldthat any truth however gently told which reproachedhis conscience and opposed his wishescould meet with a submissive reception cautiousand considerate as mrs malcolm had beenin her communications he was stung to the soulby selfreproach sid gave way to the mostrestinir vehement

happiness she hadsuffered much for her sake he would suffer allany thing every thing to see her restored he would see her himself she would explainevery thing his happiness was in her handshe never could know peace until he saw herwell and happy and for the moment he wassincere but mrs malcolm feared little for thepassionate overflows of that grief excessive asit was which could thus vent itself in outwardmanifestations it was the silence of poor edith'sovercharged heart which alarmed her but shestrove by mild and gentle words to soothe sirreginald into composure and at last succeededin

knew ladyelizabeth would not proceed without her andthat she could not bear the thought of bringingdestiny so large a party at such a time to a house wherequiet was enjoined this seemed only what was considerate and reasonable and mr andmrs malcolm forbore to urge the invitationwhich their hospitality rather than their inclinationhad led them to make they thereforefollowed that admirable precept welcomethe coming speed the parting guest and orderedtheir horses to be got ready to carrythe travellers forward on their journey although it is only a few miles from thisto the ferry said captain malcolm addressinglady waldegrave yet as the road in someplaces borders rather too much on the sublimei hope you will allow me faute de mieux toescort you so far that i may consign you intolady elizabeth's hands past all peril by landas well as by water i trustbefore morinda could reply reginald hastilyinterposed and said pardon me captainmalcolm but i undertook the office of conductinglady waldegrave to her friends andtherefore consider myself bound to see her safeunder lady elizabeth's care dcstinr it was an important trust that was committedto you i admit but may you not delegateyour authority to another and appoint me yourproxy said captain malcolm who supposedsir reginald must be doing the greatest violenceto his feelings in quitting edith at such a timeeven for a few hours what do you saylady waldegrave don't you think a staid oldhighlander may be as safe an escort as a hotbrainedyoung lover who i have already said cried reginald with aheightened colour and in great embarrassmentthat i must see lady waldegrave to the ferrymyself the distance is short and i shall findmy own horses there or most likely i shall takethe boat in returning at all events i shall beback

malcolm made no attempt to check thegenial current of feeling for she knew that thegrief which can feel even despair is never so destinydangerous as that which benumbs the spirits andbereaves it even of the sense of feeling andfragile as is the mould of the human heart tisone which may be bruised but is rarely brokenby the first rude shock it sustains chi the depthof that agony which some may feel

long intervaldestiny passed during which edith remained whollyabsorbed in the anguish of her own spirit is there no way in which a fond and faithfulfriend can help you dearest edith said herfriend

flowed freely andher judicious friend tenderly embracing herleft her for a little as she hoped to the reposeof exhausted naturedestiny chapter xxvit is a common remark that few things exercisea more baneful and despotic influence onthe mind and feelings than an irregular or misplacedattachment and sir reginald formed noexception to this general rule shrinking fromthe contemplation of the torture he had inflictedon the true and tender heart which had so longand devotedly been his he sought to stifle thesense of her wrongs in the charms of ladywaldegrave's society it would have beenagony to his selfish fiery spirit to have waitedand watched the slow progress of her recoveryfrom the wound his own hand had inflicted forto suffer and be still is perhaps one of thehardest lessons the proud heart of man can stoopto learn he therefore strove by more active destinyexertion to banish the distracting thoughts thatfilled his mind and sought a temporary refuge from the upbraiding of his conscience

and generous but there is a virtuesand a generosity whose roots are in selfishnessand which when brought to the test will everbear its worthless fruits neither can consistency dwell in that heart

thesituation of both parties was one of the mostpainful embarrassment but for either of themto leave him was impossible in the critical statehe was then in when the slightest opposition tohis wishes would in all probability have beenattended with the most fatal consequences althoughin obedience to her fitthers commandsshe gave him much of her company when reginaldwas present she carefully avoided all occa destinysons of being alone with the latter and whenthey met at meals she strove as much as possibleto maintain the unvarying calm politenessof manner which was merely due towards herfsuher's
