but only in the temple it thenceappears to have been a part of the ceremonialpedagogy which is now abolished nor can anysay it was a part of moral worship and whereasthe common usage now hath confined instrumentalmusic to cathedrals it seems therein toomuch to judaism which to do is a part of theantichristian apostacy as well as to paganismif we admit instrumental music in the worshipof god how can we resist the imposition of allthe instruments used among the ancient jews yea dancing as well as playing and severalother judaic actions during the short but active reign of the puritansin england they acted upon this preposterousopinion and sold the church organswithout being scrupulous concerning the uses towhich they might be applied a writer of thatage speaking of the prevalence of drunkennessas a national vice says that nothing may bewanting to the height of luxury and impiety ofthis abomination they have translated the organsout of the churches to set them up in tavernschaunting their dithyrambic and bestial bacchanalianto the tune of those instruments whichwere wont to assist them in the celebration ofgod's praises ad regulate the voices of theworst singers in the world which are the englishin their churches at presentit cannot be supposed that the organs whichwere thus disposed of were instruments of anygreat cost or value an old pair of organs forthat

ifthey had not been at a revolutionary price wouldbe within the purchase of an ordinary vintnerin country parish churches says mr densethe antiquary even where the district wassmall there was often a

himself for havinggiven him such a destination and to thankprovidence that the youth was placed with amaster whose kindness and religious care of himmight truly be called fatherly there was butone consideration which sometimes interfered withthat satisfaction and brought with it a sense ofuneasiness the doves from time immemorialhad belonged to the soil as fixedly as the soil hadbelonged to them generation after generationthey had moved in the same contracted spheretheir wants and wishes being circumscribed alikewithin their own few hereditary acres prideunder whatever form it may shew itself is of thedevil and though family pride may not be itsmost odious manifestation even that child bears asufficiently ugly likeness of its father but familyfeeling is a very different thing and may exist asstrongly in humble as in high life naboth wasas much attached to the vineyard the inheritanceof his fathers as ahab could be to thethrone which had been the prize and the rewardor punishment of his father omits ambitionthis feeling sometimes induced a doubt indaniel whether affection for his son had notmade him overlook his duty to his forefathers whether the fixtures of the land are not happierand less in the way of evil than the moveables whether he had done right in removing the ladfrom that station of life in which he was bornin which it had pleased god to place him divorcinghim as it were from his paternal soil andcutting off the entail of that sure independencethat safe contentment which his ancestors hadobtained and preserved for him and transmittedto his care to be in like manner by him preservedand handed down the latent poetry whichthere was in the old man's heart made him sometimesfeel as if the fields and the brook and thehearth and the graves reproached him for havingdone this but then he took shelter in the reflectionthat he had consulted the boy's true welfareby giving him opportunities of storing andenlarging his mind that he had placed him inthe way of intellectual advancement where hemight improve the talents which were committedto his charge both for his own benefit and for thatof his fellowcreatures certain he was that whetherhe had acted wisely or not he had meantwell he was conscious that his determinationhad not been made without much and anxiousdeliberation nor without much and earnestprayer hitherto he saw that the blessing whichhe prayed for had followed it and he endeavouredto make his heart rest in thankful and pious hopethat that blessing would be continued wouldstthou know says quarles the lawfulness of

discouraged by thy heart thataction is not warrantable which either blushes tobeg a blessing or having succeeded dares notpresent a thanksgiving daniel might safelyput his conduct to this test and to this test infact his own healthy and uncorrupted sense ofreligion led him though probably he had neverread these golden words of quarles the emblemsit was therefore with no ordinary delight thatour good daniel received a letter from his sonasking permission to go to leyden in conformitywith his master's wishes and there prosecute hisstudies long enough to graduate as a doctor inmedicine mr hopkins he said would generouslytake upon himself the whole expencehaving adopted him as his successor and almostas a son for as such he was treated in all respectsboth by him and by his mistress who wasone of the best of women and indeed it appearedthat mr hopkins had long entertainedthis intention by the care which he had taken tomake him keep up and improve the knowledgeof latin which he had acquired under mr guythe father's consent as might be supposed wasthankfully given and accordingly daniel dovein the twentythird year of his age embarkedfrom kingston upon hull for rotterdam

given glory to thee o lord of earth and heaven southeythere were two portions of history with whichthe elder daniel was better acquainted than mostmen that of edward the third's reign andthat of the wars in the netherlands down to theyear upon both subjects he was jtomounus libri such a man is proverbially formidableat his own weapon and the book withwhich johnson immortalized osborne the booksellerby knocking him down with it was not amore formidable folio than either of those fromwhich daniel derived this knowledgenow of all the events in the wars of the lowcountries there was none which had so stronglyaffected his imagination as the siege of leydenthe patient fortitude of the besieged and theirdeliverance less by the exertions of man thoughno human exertions were omitted than by thespecial mercy of him whom the elements obeyand in whom they had put their trust were in thestrong and pious mind of daniel things of moretouching interest than the tragedy of harlem orthe wonders of military science and of couragedisplayed at the siege of antwerp who indeedcould forget the fierce answer of the listenerswhen they were for the last time summoned tosurrender that the men of leyden would neversurrender while they had one arm left to eat andanother to fight with and the not less terriblereply of the burgemeester peter adriaanzoonwanderers to some of the townsmen when

my body cut itin pieces and share it among ye as far as it willgo and who without partaking in the hopesand fears of the contest almost as if it were stillat issue can peruse the details of that amphibiousbattle if such an expression may be allowedupon the inundated country when in theextremity of their distress and at a time whenthe spaniards said that it was as impossible forthe hollanders to save leyden from their poweras it was for them to pluck the stars from heaven a great south wind which they mighttruly say came from the grace of god set inwith such a spring tide that in the course of eightand forty hours the inundation rose half a footthus rendering the fields just passable for the flatbottomed boats which had been provided for thatservice a naval battle among the trees wherethe besieged though it was fought within twomiles of their walls could see nothing because ofthe foliage and amid such a labyrinth of dykesditches rivers and fortifications that when thebesiegers retired from their palisades and sconcesthe conquerors were not aware of their own successnor the besieged of their deliverance iin this delivery says the historian and inevery particular of the enterprise doubtless allmust be attributed to the mere providence of godneither can man challenge any glory therein forwithout a miracle all the endeavours of the protestantshad been as wind but god who isalways good would not give way to the crueltieswherewith the spaniards threatened this townwith all the insolencies whereof they make professionin the taking of towns although they beby composition without any respect of humanityor honesty and there is not any man but willconfess with me if he be not some atheist orepicure who maintain that all things come bychance that this delivery is a work which bevolii htongs only unto god for if the spaniards hadbattered the town but with four cannons onlythey had carried it the people being so weakenedwith famine as they could not endure anylonger besides a part of them were ill affectedand very many cf their best men were dead ofthe plague and for another testimony that itwas god only who wrought the town was nosooner delivered but the wind which was southwestand had driven the water out of the seainto the country turned to northeast and diddrive it back again into the sea as if the southwestwind had blown those three days only tothat effect wherefore they might well say thatboth the winds and the sea had fought for thetown of leyden and as for the resolution ofthe states of holland to drown the country andto do that which they and their prince togetherwith all the commanders captains and soldiersof the army shewed in this seacourse togetherwith the constancy and resolution of the besiegedto defend themselves notwithstanding so manymiseries which they suffered and so many promisesand threats which were made unto themall in like sort proceeded from a divine instinctin the spirit of thoughtful feeling that thispassage breathes was the whole history of thattremendous struggle perused by the elder daniel and daniel the son was so deeply imbuedwith the same feeling that if he had lived till thetime of the peninsular war he would havelooked upon the condition to which spain wasreduced as a consequence of its former tyrannyand as an awful proof how surely soon or latethe sins of the fathers are visited upon the childrenoh that all history were regarded in this spirit even such as are in faith most strong of zealmost ardent should not says one of the best andwisest of theologians much misspent theirtime in comparing the degenerate fictions or historicalrelations of times ancient or modern withthe everlasting truth for though this methodcould not add much increase either to their faithor

is some just prudential cause or impedimentwhy the two parties should not bejoined together in holy matrimony there is generallysome degree of culpable imprudence incatching it because the danger is

the garden and see if anyof the fruit trees were remaining which my venerablefriend had planted and from which i hadso often plucked and atewhen we came there there was nothing bywhich i could have recognized the spot had itnot been for the mansion house that immediatelyadjoined it half of its site had been levelledto make room for a street or road whichhad been recently opened not a vestige

which had so often opened toadmit meupon returning to the spot on the followingmorning i perceived that the part which had beenrebuilt is employed as some sort of official appendageto the mansion

thatremained they could have no possible interest inany eyes but mine which were likely never tobehold them again and indeed it was evidentthat they would soon be effaced as a deformityand the naked

only genius can impart will necessarilyfollow nothing is so desirable andyet it should seem that nothing is so difficulthe who thinks least about it when he is engagedin composition will be most likely to attain it forno man ever attained it by labouring for itread all the treatises upon composition that everwere composed and you will find nothing whichconveys so much useful instruction as the accountgiven by john wesley of his own way of writingi never think of my style says he but justset down the words that come first only wheni transcribe any thing for the press then i thinkit my duty to see that every phrase be clear pureand proper conciseness which is now as it werenatural to me brings quantum sufficient of strengthif after all i observe any stiff expression i throwit out neck and shoulders let your words taketheir course freely they will then dispose themselvesin their natural order and make yourmeaning plain that is mr author supposingyou have a meaning and that it

donot say that my hand has not sometimes beenpassed across my brow nor that the fingers ofmy left hand have not played with the hair uponmy forehead like thalia's with the grass thatgrew beside oneida's tombno people have pretended to so much precisionin their language as the turks they have notonly verbs active passive transitive and reciprocalbut also verbs cooperative verbs meditativeverbs frequentative verbs negative andverbs impossible and moreover they have whatare called verbs of opinion and verbs of knowledgethe latter are used when the speakermeans it to be understood that he speaks of hisown sure knowledge and is absolutely certain ofwhat he asserts the former when he advances itonly as what he thinks likely or believes uponthe testimony of othersnow in the turkish language the wordwhereon both the meaning and the constructionof the sentence depend is placed at the end of asentence which extends not unfrequently to tenfifteen or twenty lines what therefore theymight gain in accuracy by this nice distinction ofverbs must be more than counterbalanced by theambiguity consequent upon longmindednessand notwithstanding their conscientious moodsthey are not more remarkable for veracity thantheir neighbours who in ancient times made somuch use of the indefinite tenses and were saidto be always liarswe have a sect in our own country who professto

thatwas so obvious as to require no other answer thanthe answer that was there given whether it wasthe reason why there is no portrait of dr danieldove or the reason why horrebow if he hadbeen the author of this book would simply havesaid that there was none and have said nothingmore about it the question which was answered related tohorrebow he would have said nothing moreabout the matter

tale be longhe'll cut it short i trust middletonhere i must relate a circumstance which occurredduring the few hours of my last and byme evertoberemembered visit to doncasteras we were on the way from the old angel innto the mansion house adjoining which stood orto speak more accurately had stood the kebleto which the steps of my pilgrimage were bentwe were attracted by a small but picturesquegroupe in a shavingshop exhibited in strongrelief by the light of a blazing fire and of someglaring lamps it was late in autumn and on asaturday evening at which time those persons inhumble life who cannot shave themselves andwhose sense of religion leads them to think thatwhat may be done on the saturday night oughtnot to be put off till the sunday morning settletheir weekly account with their beards therewas not story enough in the scene to have suppliedwilkie with a subject for his admirable geniusto work upon but he would certainly havesketched the groupe if he had seen it as we didstopping for a minute at civil distance from thedoor we observed a picture over the fireplaceand it seemed so remarkable that we asked permissionto go in and look at it more nearly itwas an unfinished portrait evidently of no commonperson and by no common hand and asevidently it had been painted many years agothe head was so nearly finished that nothingseemed wanting to complete the likeness thebreast and shoulders were faintly sketched in asort of whitewash which gave them the appearanceof being covered with a cloth uponasking the master of the shop if he could telluswhose portrait it was marino who seemedto be a goodnatured fellow and was pleasedat our making the enquiry replied that it hadbeen in his possession many years before he knewhimself a friend of his had made him a presentof it because he said the gentleman looked byhis dress as if he was just ready to be shaved andhad an apron under his chin and therefore hisshop was the properest place for it one dayhowever the picture attracted the notice of apassing stranger as it had done ours and he recognizedit for a portrait of garrick it certainlywas so and any one who knows garrick's facemay satisfy himself of this when he happens to bein doncaster marino's shop is not far fromthe old angel and on the same side of thestreetmy companion told me that when we enteredthe shop he had begun to hope it might prove tobe a portrait of my old friend he seemed evento be disappointed that we had not fallen uponsuch a discovery supposing that it would havegratified me beyond measure but upon consideringin my own mind if this would have beenthe case two questions presented themselvesthe first was whether knowing as i did that thedoctor never sate for his portrait and knowingalso confidentially the reason why he never couldbe persuaded to do so or rather the feeling whichpossessed him on that subject knowing thesethings i say the first question was whether if astolen likeness had been discovered i ought tohave rejoiced in the discovery for as i certainlyshould have endeavoured to purchase thepicture i should then have had to decide whetheror not it was my duty to destroy it for whichor on the other hand for preserving it so manystrong reasons and so many refined ones mighthave been produced pro and con that i couldnot have done either one or the other withoutdistrusting the justice of my own determination if i preserved it i should continually be selfaccusedfor doing wrong if i destroyed it selfreproacheswould pursue me for having donewhat was irretrievable so that while i lived ishould never have been out of my own court ofconscience and let me tell you reader thatto be impleaded in that court is even worse thanbeing brought into the court of chanceryl secondly the more curious question occurredwhether if there had been a portrait of dr doveit would have been like himthat says mr everydayman is as itmight happenpardon me sir my question does not regardhappening chance has nothing to do with thematter the thing queried is whether it couldor could not have beenand before i proceed to consider that questioni shall take the counsel which catwg the wisegave to

whopleases every body but there are some few faces with which noartist can succeed so as to please himself if hehas a true feeling for his own art or to contentthose persons who are best acquainted with theliving countenance this is the case where thecharacter predominates over the features andthat character itself is one in which many andseemingly opposite qualities are compoundedgarrick in abel drugget garrick in sir johnbrute and garrick in king lear presented threefaces as different as were the parts which he personated yet the portraits which have been publishedof him in those parts may be identified bythe same marked features which flexible as theywere rendered by his histrionic power still underall changes retained their strength and their peculiaritybut where the same flexibility existsand the features are not eo peculiar or prominentthe character is then given by what is fleetingnot by what is fixed and it is more difficult tohit a likeness of this kind than to paint a rainbownow i cannot but think that the doctor'scountenance was of this kind i can call it tomind as vividly as it appears to me in dreams but i could impart no notion of it by descriptionwords cannot delineate a single feature of hisface such words at least as my knowledge enablesme to use a sculptor if he had measuredit might have given you technically the relativeproportions of his face

that subject and if he had been a protestantsoldier which if an alsatia he waslikely to be and accustomed to read the biblehe might have been reminded by it of the towerof lebanon looking toward

that would assist anyreader to form an idea at once definite and justof any part of the doctor's face i cannot evenpositively say what was the colour of his eyes ionly know that mirth sparkled in them scornflashed from them thought beamed in them benevolenceglistened in them that they were easilymoved to smiles easily to tears no barometerever indicated more faithfully the changes of theatmosphere than his countenance corresponded tothe emotions of his mind but with a mind whichmight truly be said to have beenso various that it seemed to benot one but all mankind's epitomethus various not in

countenance that was itsfaithful index was perpetually varying its likenesstherefore at any one moment could but representa fraction of the character which identifiedit and which left upon you an

suchintercourse our philosopher enjoyed in doncasteredward miller the organist was a person verymuch after daniel dove's own heart he was awarmhearted simplehearted righthearted man an enthusiast in his profession yet not undervaluingmuch less despising other pursuitsthe one doctor knew as little of music as theother did of medicine but dr dove listened tomiller's performance with great pleasure anddr miller when he was indisposed took dove'sphysic with perfect faiththis musician was brother to william millerthe bookseller well known in the early part ofthe present century as a publisher of splendidworks to whose flourishing business in albemarlestreet the more flourishing john murray succeededin the worldly sense of the word themusician was far less fortunate than the bibliopolea doctorate in his own science being the heightof the honours to which he attained and the placeof organist at doncaster the height of the prefermenta higher station was once presentedto his hopes the marquis of rockingham appliedin his behalf for the place of master of hismajesty's band of musicians then vacated by thedeath of dr boyce and the duke of manchesterwho was at that time lord chamberlainwould have given it him if the king had not particularlydesired him to bestow it on mr stanleythe celebrated blind performer on the organ drmiller was more gratified by this proof of themarquis's good will towards him than disappointedat its failure had the application succeededhe would not have written the history ofdoncaster nor would he have borne a part in awellintended and judicious attempt at reformingour church psalmody in which part of our churchservice reformation is greatly needed this meritoriousattempt was made when george haydrummond whose father had been archbishopof york was vicar of doncaster having beenpresented to that vicarage in on the demiseof mr hatfieldat that time the parish clerk used there as inall other parish churches to chuse what psalmshould be sung to the praise and glory of godand what portions of it and considering himselfas a much more important person in this departmentof his office than the organist the onlycommunication upon the subject which he heldwith dr miller was to let him know what tunehe must play and how often he was to repeat itstrange absurdity says miller how couldthe organist placed in this degrading situationproperly perform his part of the church service not knowing the words it was impossible for himto accommodate his music to the various sentimentscontained in different stanzas consequentlyhis must be a mere random performance andfrequently producing improper effects thishowever is what only a musician would feel butit happened one sunday that the clerk gave outsome verses which were either ridiculously inapplicableto the day or bore some accidental andludicrous application so that many of the congregationdid not refrain from laughter mr drummondupon this for he was zealously attentive toall the duties of his calling said to miller thatin order to prevent any such occurrence in futurehe would make a selection of the best verses ineach psalm from the authorized version of tateand brady and arrange them for every sundayand festival throughout the year provided hethe organist who was perfectly qualified for sucha task would adapt them to proper music tosuch a man as miller this was the greatest gratificationthat could have been afforded and itproved also to be the greatest service that wasever rendered to him in the course of his life for through mr drummond's interest the kingand the bishop patronized the work and nearlyfive thousand copies were subscribed for the listof subscribers being it is believed longer thanhad ever been obtained for any musical publicationin this kingdomstrange to say nothing of this kind had beenattempted before for the use of psalmody in ourchurches was originally no part of the service but having as it were crept in and been at firstrather suffered than encouraged and afterwardsallowed and permitted only not enjoined noprovision seems ever to have been made for itsproper or even decent performance and whenan arrangement like this of mr drummond's hadbeen prepared and dr miller with sound judgementhad adapted it where that could be doneto the most popular of the old and venerablemelodies which had been so long in possession itmay seem more strange that it should not havebeen brought into general use this i say mightbe thought strange if any instance of that supineand sinful negligence which permits the continuanceof old and acknowledged defects in thechurch establishment and church service couldbe thought somr drummond had probably been led tothink upon this subject by mason's conversationand by his essays historical and critical on englishchurch music mason who had a poet'sear and eye was ambitious of becoming both amusician and a painter according to miller hesucceeded better in his musical than in his pictorialattempts for he performed decently on theharpsichord but in painting he never arrivedeven at a degree of mediocrity and in music itwas not possible to teach him the principles ofcomposition miller and others having at his owndesire attempted in vain to instruct him nevervolii ntireless such a man however superficial his knowledgeof the art could not but feel and reason justlyupon its use and abuse in our church service and he was for restricting the organist much in thesame way that drummond and miller were for restrainingthe clerk for after observing that whatis called the voluntary requires an innate inventivefaculty which is certainly not the lot of many and that the happy few who possess it will notat all times be able to restrain it within thebounds which reason and in this case religionwould prescribe he said it was to be wishedtherefore that in our established church extemporeplaying were as much discountenanced asextempore praying and that the organist wereas closely obliged in this solo and separate part ofhis office to keep to set forms as the officiatingminister or as he himself is when accompanyingthe choir in an anthem or a parochial congregationin a psalm he would have indulged himhowever with a considerable quantity of these setforms and have allowed him if he approached insome degree to rousseau's high character of aprelude to descant on certain single gravetexts which martini geminiani corelli or handelwould abundantly furnish and which may befound at least of equal elegance and propriety inthe largo and adagio movements of haydn orpleyelwhatever miller may have thought of thisproposal there was a passage in mason's essayin favour of voluntaries which was in perfect accordwith dr doves notions prompt and asit were casual strains says the poet which donot fix the attention of the hearer provided theyare the produce of an original fancy which scornsto debase itself by imitating common and trivialmelodies are of all others the best adapted toinduce mental serenity we in some sort listento such music as we do to the pleasing murmurof a neighbouring brook the whisper of the passingbreeze or the distant warbling of the larkand nightingale and if agreeable natural voiceshave the power of soothing the contemplativemind without interrupting its contemplationssimple musical effusions must assuredly have thatpower in a superior degree all that is to beattended to by the organist is to preserve suchpleasing simplicity and this musical measureswill ever have if they are neither strongly accentednor too regularly rhythmical but whenthis is the case they cease to soothe us becausethey begin to affect us add to this that an airreplete with short cadences and similar passagesis apt to fix itself too strongly on the memory whereas a merely melodious or harmonica movementglides as it were through the ear awakensa transient pleasing sensation but leaves behindit no lasting impression its effect ceases whenits impulse on the auditory nerve ceases an impulsestrong enough to dispel from the mind alleating care to use our great poet's own expressionbut in no sort to rouze or ruffle any of itsfaculties save those only which attend truly devotionaldutythis passage agreed with some of the doctor'speculiar notions he felt the power of devotionalmusic both in such preparatory strains asmason has here described and in the more excitingemotions of congregational psalmody andbeing thus sensible of the religious uses whichmay be drawn from music he was the more easilyled to entertain certain speculations concerningits application in the treatment of diseases as willbe related hereafterchapter lxviiieccentric persons why apparently more commonin england than in other countriesharry

forward from time to time inpopular compilations a collection of what iscalled eccentric biography is to form a portionof mr murray's family librarybut eccentric characters probably are more frequentamong us than among most other nations and for this there are two causes the first is tobe found in that spirit of independence uponwhich the english pride themselves and whichproduces a sort of drawcansirlike bravery inmen who are eccentrically inclined it becomesa perverse sort of pleasure in them to act preposterouslyfor the sake of showing that they have aright to do as they please and the courage to exercisethat right let the rest of the world thinkwhat it will of their conductthe other reason is that madhouses very insufficientlysupply the place of convents and veryill also it might almost be questioned whetherconvents do not well nigh make amends to humanityfor their manifold mischiefs and abominationsby the relief which they afford as asylumsfor insanity in so many of its forms and gradationsthey afford a cure also in many of itsstages and precisely upon the same principle onwhich the treatment in madhouses is founded but oh how differently is that principle applied that passive obedience to anothers will which inthe one case is exacted by authority acting throughfear and oftentimes enforced by no scrupulous ortender means is in the other required as a religiousduty an act of virtue a voluntary and acceptedsacrifice a good work which will be carried tothe patient's account in the world to come theywho enter a convent are to have no will of theirown there they renounce it solemnly upon theiradmission and when this abnegation is sincerelymade the chief mental cause of insanity is removedfor assuredly in most cases madness ismore frequently a

dirtyand covered with resin with this humble companionhe used to work hard every morning onthe old solos of vivaldi tessarini corelli andother ancient composers the evening was reservedfor mere

that hearts had been interchangedremembrance will enable some of myreaders to pourtray the scene and then perhapsa sigh may be heaved for the days that are gone hope will picture it to others and with them thesigh will be for the days that are to comethere was not that indefinite deferment of hopein this case at which the heart sickens leonardhad been bred up in poverty from his childhood a parsimonious allowance grudgingly bestowedhad contributed to keep him frugal at college bycalling forth a pardonable if not a commendablesense of pride in aid of a worthier principle heknew that he could rely upon himself for frugalityindustry and a cheerful as well as a contentedmind he had seen the miserable state ofbondage in which margaret existed with her auntand his resolution was made to deliver her fromthat bondage as soon as he could obtain the smallestbenefice on which it was possible for them tosubsist they agreed to live rigorously withintheir means however poor and put their

hitherto she hadfelt herself a forlorn and solitary creature withouta friend and the sweet sounds and pleasant objectsof nature had imparted as little cheerfulnessto her as to the debtor who sees green fields insunshine from his prison and hears the larksinging at liberty her heart was open now toall the exhilarating and all the softening influencesof birds fields flowers vernal suns andmelodious streams she was subject to the samedaily and hourly exercise of meekness patienceand humility but the trial was no longer painful with love in her heart and hope and sunshine inher

civilization has given us therewas then no mail coach to waft a sigh across thecountry at the rate of eight miles an hourletters came slowly and with long intervals between but when they came the happiness whichthey imparted to leonard and margaret lastedduring the interval however long to leonardit was as an exhilarate and a cordial which rejoicedand strengthened him he trod the earth witha lighter and more elated movement on the daywhen he received a letter from margaret as if hefelt himself invested with an importance whichhe had never possessed till the happiness ofanother human being was inseparably associatedwith his own so proud a thing it was for him to wearlove's golden chainwith which it is best freedom to be boundhappy indeed if there be happiness on earthas that same sweet poet says is hewho love enjoys and placed hath his mindwhere fairest virtues fairest beauties gracethen in himself such store of worth doth findthat he deserves to find so good a placethis was leonard's case and when he kissedthe paper which her hand had pressed it was witha consciousness of the strength and sincerity ofhis affection which at once rejoiced arid fortifiedhis heart to margaret his letters werelike summer dew upon the herb that thirsts forsuch refreshment whenever they arrived aheadache became the cause or pretext for redrummondtiring earlier than usual to her
