intimacy with good mrsthe housekeeper in that most interestingpart of the old building called queenmary's apartments but a circumstance whichlately happened has conferred upon me greaterprivileges so that indeed i might i believeventure on the exploit of chaplet who wasexecuted for being found secreted at midnightin the very bedchamber of scotland's mistressit chanced that the good lady i have

scotland who hung aroundme should be each and every one painted witha nose like the knocker of a door when lo thewalls once more reechoed with such shrieks asformerly were as often heard in the scottishpalaces as were sounds of revelry and musicsomewhat surprised at such an alarm in a placeso solitary i hastened to the spot and foundthe wellmeaning traveller scrubbing the floorlike a housemaid while mrs dragginghim by the skirts of the coat in vain endeavouredto divert him from his sacrilegious purposeit cost me some trouble to explain to thezealous purifier of silkstockings embroideredwaistcoats broadcloth and deal planks thatthere were such things in the world as stainswhich ought to remain indelible on accountof the associations with which they are connectedour good friend viewed everything oithe kind only as the means of displaying thevirtue of his vaunted commodity he comprehendedhowever that he would not be permittedto proceed to exemplify its powers on thepresent occasion so took his leave mutteringthat he had always heard the scots were anasty people but had no idea they carried it sofaras to choose to have the floors of their palacesbloodaltered

in her expressions of thanks andyet her gratitude instead of exhausting itselfin these declarations according to the way ofthe world continues as lively at this momentas if she had never thanked me at all it isowing to her recollection of this piece of goodservice that i have the permission of wanderinglike the ghost of some departed gentlemanusherthrough these deserted halls sometimesas the old irish ditty expresses itthinking on things that are long enough ago and sometimes wishing i could with the goodluck of most editors of romantic narrativelight upon some hidden crypt or massive antiquecabinet which should yield to my researchesan almost illegible manuscript containingthe authentic particulars of some of thestrange deeds of those wild days of the unhappymarymy dear mrs baliol used to sympathize withme when i regretted that all the godsend ofthis nature had ceased to occur and that an authormight chatter his teeth to pieces by theseaside without a wave ever wafting to him acasket containing such a history as that of automatic that he might break his shins instumbling through a hundred vaults withoutfinding anything but rats and mice and becomethe tenant of a dozen sets of shabby tenementswithout seeing any manuscript but the weeklybill for board and lodging a dairymaid ofthese degenerate days might as well wash anddeck her dairy in hopes of finding the fairy testerin her shoeit is a sad and too true a tale cousinsaid mrs baliol i am sure we all have occasionto regret the want of these ready supplementsto a failing invention but you most ofall have right to complain that the fairies havenot favoured your researches you who haveshown the world that the age of chivalry stillexists you the knight of croftangry whobraved the fury of the london prentice boldin behalf of the fair dame and the memorialof rizzio's slaughter is it not a pity cousinconsidering the feat of chivalry was otherwiseso much according to rule is it not isay a great pity that the lady had not been alittle younger and the legend a little older why as to the age at which a fair dameloses the benefits of chivalry and is no longerentitled o crave boon of brave knight that iuleave to the statutes of the order of errantry but for the blood of rizzio i take up the gauntletand maintain against all and sundry that ihold the stains to be of no modern date butto have been actually the consequence and therecord of that terrible assassinationas i cannot accept the challenge to thefield fair cousin i am contented to requireproofthe unaltered tradition of the palace andthe correspondence of the existing state of thingswith that traditionexplain if you pleasei will the universal tradition bears thatwhen rizzio was dragged out of the chamber ofthe queen the heat and fury of the assassinswho struggled which should deal him mostwounds dispatched him at the door of the anteroomthere therefore the greater quantityof the blood was spilled and there the marks ofit are still shown it is reported further by historiansthat mary continued her entreaties forhis life mingling her prayers with screams andexclamations until she knew that he was assuredlyslain on which she wiped her eyes andsaid i will now study revenge all this is granted but the blood wouldit not wash out or waste out think you in somany years i am coming to that presently the constanttradition of the palace says that marydischarged any measures to be taken to removethe marks of slaughter which she had resolvedshould remain as a memorial to quicken andconfirm her purposed vengeance but it is addedthat satisfied with the knowledge that itexisted and not desirous to have the ghastlyevidence always under her eye she causeda traverse as it is called that is a temporaryscreen of boards to be drawn along theunder part of the anteroom a few feet fromthe door so as to separate the place stainedwith the blood from the rest of the apartmentand involve it in considerable obscurity nowthis temporary partition still exists and byrunning across and interrupting the plan ofthe roof and cornices plainly intimates that ithas been intended to serve some temporarypurpose since it disfigures the proportions ofthe room interferes with the ornaments of theceiling and could only have been put there forsome such purpose as hiding an object too disagreeableto be looked upon as to the objectionthat the bloodstains would have disappearedin course of time i apprehend that if measuresto efface them were not taken immediatelyafter the affair happened if the blood inother words were allowed to sink into thewood the stain would become almost indeliblenow not to mention that our scottish palaceswere not particularly well washed in those daysand that there were no patent drops to assistthe labours of the mop i think it very probablethat these dark relics might subsist for a longcourse of time even if mary had not desired or directedthat they should be preserved but screenedby the traverse from public sight i knowseveral instances of similar bloodstains remainingfor a great many years and i doubt whetherafter a certain time anything can removethem save the carpenter's plane if any seneschalby way of increasing the interest of theapartments had by means of paint or any othermode of imitation endeavoured to palm uponposterity supposititious stigmata i conceive thatthe impostor would have chosen the queers cabinetand the bedroom for the scene of his trickplacing his bloody tracery where it could be distinctlyseen by visitors instead of hiding it behindthe traverse in this manner the existenceof the said traverse or temporary partition isalso extremely difficult to be accounted for if thecommon and ordinary tradition be rejected inshort all the rest of this striking locality is sotrue to the historical fact that i think it maywell bear out the additional circumstance of theblood on the floor i profess to you answered mrs baliolthat i am very willing to be converted toyour faith we talk of a credulous vulgarwithout always recollecting that there is a vulgarincredulity which in historical matters aswell as in those of religion finds it easier todoubt than to examine and endeavours to assumethe credit of an esprit fort by denyingowhatever happens to be a little beyond the verylimited comprehension of the sceptic and sothat point being settled and

priorsays geographers on pathless downsplace elephants for want of towns if such be your advice my dear lady saidi the course of my story shall take its riseupon this occasion at a remote period of historyand in a province removed from my naturalsphere of the canongateit was under the influence of those feelingsthat i undertook the following historical romancewhich often suspended and flung asideis now arrived at a size too important to bealtogether thrown away although there may belittleprudence in sending it to the pressi have not placed in the mouth of the charactersthe lowland scotch dialect now spokenbecause unquestionably the scottish of that dayresembled very closely the anglosaxon witha sprinkling of french or norman to enrich itthose who wish to investigate the subject mayconsult the chronicles of wanton and the historyof bruce by archdeacon barbour butsupposing my own skill in the ancient scottishwere sufficient to invest the dialogue with itspeculiarities a translation must have been necessaryfor the benefit of the general readerthe scottish dialect may be therefore consideredas laid aside unless where the use of peculiarwords may add emphasis or

beautiful points of viewwhich britain or perhaps the world can affordis or rather we may say was the prospect froma spot called the wicks of beglie being a speciesof niche at which the traveller arrived aftera long stage from kinross through a wasteand uninteresting country and from which asforming a pass over the summit of a ridgy eminencewhich he had gradually surmounted hebeheld stretching beneath him the valley of thetay traversed by its ample and lordly stream the town of perth with its two large meadowsor inches its steeples and its towers the hills ofmoncrieff and kinnoul faintly

communicate or in his to receive the exquisitecharm which surprise gives to pleasurewhen so splendid a view arises when least expectedor hoped for and which chrystal croftangryexperienced when he beheld for the firsttime the matchless scenechildish wonder indeed was an ingredientin my delight for i was not above fifteen yearsold and as this had been the first excursionwhich i was permitted to make on a pony of myown i also experienced the glow of independencemingled with that degree of anxietywhich the most conceited boy feels when he isfirst abandoned to his own undirected counselsi recollect pulling up the reins without meaningto do so and gazing on the scene before me asif i had been afraid it would shift like those in atheatre before i could distinctly observe its differentparts or convince myself that what i sawwas real since that hour and the period isnow more than fifty years past the recollectionof that inimitable landscape has possessed thestrongest influence over my mind and retainedits place as a memorable thing when much thatwas influential on my own fortunes has fledfrom my recollection it is therefore naturalthat whilst deliberating on what might bebrought forward for the amusement of the publici should pitch upon some narrative connectedwith the splendid scenery which made somuch impression on my youthful imaginationand which may perhaps have that effect in settingoff the imperfections of the composition whichladies suppose a fine set of china to possess inheightening the flavour of indifferent teathe period at which i propose to commenceis however considerably earlier than either ofthe remarkable historical transactions to whichi have already alluded as the events which iam about to recount occurred during the lastyears of the fourteenth century when the scottishsceptre was swayed by the gentle but feeblehand of john who reigned under the title ofrobert the thirdmchapter iiperth boasting as we have already mentionedso large a portion of the beauties of inanimatenature has at no time been without itsown share of those charms which are at oncemore interesting and more transient to be calledthe fair maid of perth would at any periodhave been a high distinction and have inferredno mean superiority in beauty where therewere many to claim that muchenvied attributebut in the feudal times to which we now callthe reader's attention female beauty was a qualityof much higher importance than it has beensince the ideas of chivalry have been in a greatmeasure extinguished the love of the ancientcavaliers was a licensed species of idolatrywhich the love of heaven alone was theoreticallysupposed to approach in intensity and whichin practice it seldom equalled god and the ladieswere familiarly appealed to in the samebreath and devotion to the fair sex was as peremptorilyenjoined upon the aspirant to thehonour of chivalry as that which was due toheaven at such a period in society the powerof beauty was almost unlimited it could levelthe highest rank with that which was immeasurablyinferiorit was but in the reign preceding that ofrobert iii that beauty alone had elevated aperson of inferior rank and indifferent morals toshare the scottish throne and many women lessartful or less fortunate had risen to greatnessfrom a state of concubinage for which the mannersof the times made allowance and apologysuch views might have dazzled a girl of higherbirth than catharine or katie glover who wasuniversally acknowledged to be the most beautifulyoung woman of the city or its vicinity andwhose renown as the fair maid of perth haddrawn on her much notice from the young gallantsof the royal court when it chanced to beresiding in or near perth insomuch that morethan one nobleman of the highest rank and mostdistinguished for deeds of chivalry were moreattentive to exhibit feats of horsemanship asthey passed the door of old simon glover inwhat was called couvrefew or curfew streetthan to distinguish themselves in the tournamentswhere the noblest dames of scotlandwere spectators of their addressbut the glover's daughter for as was commonwith citizens and artizans of that earlyperiod her father simon derived his sirnamefrom the trade which he practised showedno inclination to listen to any gallantry whichcame from those of a station highly exaltedabove that which she herself occupied andthough probably in no degree insensible to herpersonal charms seemed desirous to confine herconquests to those who were within her ownsphere of life indeed her beauty being ofthat kind which we connect more with themind than with the person was notwithstandingher natural kindness and gentleness of dispositionrather allied to reserve than to gaietyeven when in company with her equals vol i cand the earnestness with which she attendedupon the exercises of devotion induced manyto think that catharine glover nourished theprivate wish to retire from the world and buryherself in the recesses of the cloister but tosuch a sacrifice should it be meditated it wasnot to be expected her father reputed a wealthyman and having this only child would yield awilling consentin her resolution of avoiding the addresses ofthe gallant courtiers the reigning beauty ofperth was confirmed by the sentiments of herparent let them go he said let them gocatharine those gallants with their

in the character of adomestic or protector should there be cause forhis interference but it was not difficult to discernby the earnest attention which he paid tocatharine glover that it was to her

theair of a man who has something burthensome onhis mind but when the service was ended heseemed free from anxiety as one who had referredhimself and his troubles to the disposalof heaven the ceremony of high mass wasperformed with considerable solemnity a numberof noblemen and ladies of rank being presentpreparations had indeed been made forthe reception of the good old king himself butsome of those infirmities to which he was subjecthad prevented robert iii from attending theservice as was his wont when the congregationwere dismissed the glover and his beautifuldaughter lingered for some time for thepurpose of making their several shifts in theconfessionals where the priests had taken theirplaces for discharging that part of their dutythus it happened that the night had fallen darkand the way was solitary when they returnedalong the now deserted streets to their own dwellingmost persons had betaken themselves tohome and to bed they who still lingered in thestreet were nightwalkers

crossed it and when they advanced orslackened their pace the stranger's was in proportionaccelerated or diminished the matterwould have been of very little consequence hadsimon glover been alone but the beauty of hisdaughter might render her the object of someprofligate scheme in a country where the lawsafforded such slight protection to those who hadnot the means to defend themselves conchaand his fair charge having arrived on thethreshold of their own apartment which wasopened to them by an old female servant theburgher's uneasiness was ended determinedhowever to ascertain if possible

in fulllight among them and though his appearancewas neither dignified nor handsome his face andfigure were not only deserving of attention butseemed in some manner to command it he wasrather below the middle stature but the breadthof his shoulders length and frankness of hisarms and the muscular appearance of the wholeman argued a most unusual share of strengthand a frame kept in vigour by constant exercisehis legs were somewhat bent but not in a mannerwhich could be said to approach to deformity on the contrary which seemed to correspondto the strength of his frame though it injuredin some degree its symmetry his dress was ofbuffhide and he wore in a belt around hiswaist a heavy broadsword and a dirk or poniardas if to defend his purse which burgherfashionwas attached to the same cincturethe head was well proportioned round closecropped and curled thickly with black hairthere was daring and resolution in the darkeye but the other features seemed to expressa bashful timidity mingled with good humourand obvious satisfaction at meeting with his oldfriends abstracted from the bashful expressionwhich was that of the moment the foreheadof henry gow or smith for he was indifferentlyso called as both words equally indicatedhis profession was high and noblebut the lower part of the face was less happilyformed the mouth was large and wellfurnishedwith a set of firm and beautiful teeth theappearance of which corresponded with the airof personal health and muscular strength whichthe whole frame indicated a short thick beardand moustaches which had lately been arrangedwith some care completed the picture hisage could not exceed eightandtwentythe family appeared all well pleased withthe unexpected appearance of an old friendsimon glover shook his hand again and againvol i udorothy made her compliments and catharineherself offered freely her hand which henryheld in his massive grasp as if he designed tocarry it to his lips but after a moment's hesitationdesisted from fear lest the freedom mightbe ill taken not that there was any resistanceon the part of the little hand which lay passivein his grasp but there was a smile mingledwith the blush on her cheek which seemed toincrease the confusion of the gallant her fatheron his part called out frankly as he sawhis friend's hesitation her lips man her lips and that's a profferi would not

the old glover i will not be used thus by him hishighland blood forsooth is too gentle to lay atrencher or spread a napkin and he expects toenter our ancient and honourable craft withoutduly waiting and tending upon his master andteacher in all matters of lawful obedience gocall him i say i will not be thus neglecteddorothy was presently heard screaming upstairsor more probably up a ladder to thecockloft to which the recusant apprentice hadmade an untimely retreat a muttered answerwas returned and soon after conachar appearedin the eating apartment there was a gloomof deep sullenness on his haughty though handsomefeatures and as he proceeded to spreadthe board and arrange the trenchers with saltspices and other condiments to discharge inshort the duties of a modern domestic whichthe custom of the time imposed upon all apprentices he was obviously disgusted and indignantwith the mean office imposed upon himthe fair maid of perth looked with some anxietyat him as if apprehensive that his evidentsullenness might increase her father's displeasure but it was not till her eyes had soughtout his for a second time that conachar condescendedto veil his dissatisfaction and throwa greater appearance of willingness and submissioninto the services which he was performingand here we must acquaint our reader thatthough the private interchange of looks betwixtcatharine glover and the young mountaineerindicated some interest on the part of the formerin the conduct of the latter it would havepuzzled the strictest observer to discover whetherthat feeling exceeded in degree what

courage retired to her sleeping apartmentaccording to her master's commands the twofriends were left aloneit grieves me friend henry said simonfilling at the same time his own glass and hisguest's it grieves me from my soul that mydaughter retains this silly humour but alsomethinks thou nights mend it why wouldstthou come hither clattering with thy sword anddagger when the girl is so silly that she cannotbear the sight of these dost thou not rememberthat thou hadst a sort of quarrel with hereven before thy last departure from perth becausethou wouldst not go like other honest quietburghers but must be ever armed like one ofthe rascally jackie that wait on the nobilitysure it is time enough for decent burgesses toarm at the tolling of the common bell whichcalls us out odin in effeir of warwhy my good father that was not myfault but i had no sooner quitted my nag thani run hither to tell you of my return thinkingif it were your will to permit me that i wouldget your advice about being mistress catharine'svalentine for the year and then i heard frommrs dorothy that you were gone to hear mass atthe black friars so i thought i would followthither partly to hear the same mass with youand partly our lady and st valentine forgiveme to look upon one who thinks little enoughof me and as you entered the church methoughti saw two or three dangerouslookingmen holding counsel together and gazing atyou and at her and in especial sir john ramornwhom i knew well enough for all hisdisguise and the velvet patch over his eye andthat is not in dread of war but in the guise which cjf'eirsor belongs to war in arms namely offensive and defensive m bodinin fear of war a frequent term in old scottish history andmuniments means arrayed in warlike guisehis cloak so like a serving man's methoughtfather simon that as you were old and yonderslip of a highlander something too young to dobattle i would even walk quietly after you notdoubting with the tools i had about me to bringany one to reason that might disturb you inyour way home you know that yourself discoveredme and drew me into the house whetheri would or no otherwise i promise youi would not have seen your daughter till i haddonned the new jerkin which was made at berwickafter the latest cut nor would i have appearedbefore her with these weapons which shedislikes so much although to say truth somany are at deadly feud with me for one unhappychance or another that it is as needfulfor me as for any man in scotland to go bynight with weapons about methe silly wench never thinks of that saidsimon glover she never has sense to considerthat in our dear native land of scotlandevery man deems it his privilege and duty toavenge his own wrong but harry my boythou art to blame for taking her talk so muchto heart i have seen thee bold enough withother wenches wherefore so still and tonguetiedwith her because she is something different fromother maidens father glover because she isnot only more beautiful but wiser higher holierand seems to me as if she were made of betterclay than we that approach her i can holdmy head high enough with the rest of the lassesround the maypole but somehow when i approachcatharine i feel myself an earthlycoarse ferocious creature scarce worthy to lookon her much less to contradict the preceptswhich she expounds to meil you are an imprudent merchant harrysmith replied simon and rate too highthe goods you wish to purchase catharine isa good girl and my daughter but if you makeher a conceited ape by your bashfulness and yourflattery neither you nor i will see our wishesaccomplishedi i often fear it my good father said thesmith for i feel how little i am deserving ofcatharinevol ifeel a thread's end said the gloverfeel for me friend smith for catharine andme think how the poor thing is beset frommorning to night and by what sort of personseven though windows be down and doors shutwe were accosted today by one too powerfulto be named ay and he showed his displeasureopenly because i would not permit himto gallant my daughter in the church itselfwhen the priest was saying mass there areothers scarce less reasonable i sometimes wishthat catharine were some degrees less fair thatshe might not catch that dangerous sort of admirationor somewhat less holy that she mightsit down like an honest woman contented withstout henry smith who could protect his wifeagainst every sprig of chivalry in the court ofscotlandand if i did not said henry thrusting outa hand and arm which might have belonged toa giant for bone and muscle i would i maynever bring hammer upon anvil again ayan it were come but that length my fair catharineshould see that there is no harm in a manhaving the trick of defence but i believe shethinks the whole world is one great minsterchurchand that all who live in it should behaveas if they were at an eternal massnay in truth said the father she hasstrange influence over those who approach her the highland lad conachar with whom i havebeen troubled for these two or three years althoughyou may see he has the natural spirit ofhis people obeys the least sign which catharinemakes him and indeed will hardly beruled by any one else in the house she takesmuch pains with him to bring him from his rudehighland habitshere harry smith became uneasy in his chairlifted the flaggon set it down and at length exclaimed the devil take the young highlandwhelp and his whole kindred what has catharineto do to instruct such a fellow as he he will be just like the wolfcub that i was foolenough to train to the offices of a dog and everyonethought him reclaimed till in an ill houri went to walk on the hill of moncrieff whenhe broke loose on the laird's flock and madea havock that i might well have rued had thelaird not wanted harness at the time and imarvel that you being a sensible man fatherglover will keep this highland young fellowa likely one i promise you so nigh to catharineas if there were no other than your daughterto serve him for a schoolmistressfie my son fie now you are jealoussaid simon of a poor young fellow who totell you the truth resides here because he maynot so well live on the other side of the hillay ay father simon retorted the smithwho had all the narrowminded feelings of theburghers of his time an it were not for fearof offence i would say that you have even toomuch packing and peeling with yonder loonsout of burghi must get my deerhides kidskins andso forth somewhere my good harry andhighlandmen give good bargainsthey can afford them replied henrydrily for they sell nothing but stolen gearwell well be that as it may it is not mybusiness where they get the bestial so i getthe hides but as i was saying there are certainconsiderations why i am willing to obligethe father of this young man by keeping himhere and he is but half a highlander neitherand wants a thought of the dour spirit of aglueamie after all i have seldom seen himso fierce as he showed himself but nowyou could not unless he had killed hisman replied the smith in the same dry tonenevertheless if you wish it harry i'll setall other respects aside and send the landholderto seek other quarters tomorrow morningnay father said the smith you cannotsuppose that harry gow cares the value of asmithydander for such a cub as yonder catmountain i care little i promise you though allhis clan were coming down the shoe gate withslogan crying and pipes playing i would findfifty blades and bucklers would send them backfaster than they came but to speak truththough it is a fool's speech too i care not tosee the fellow so much with catharine rescindermember lather glover your trade keeps youreyes and hands close employed and must haveyour heedful care even if this lazy lurdanewrought at it which you know yourself he seldomdoesand that is true said simon he cutsall his gloves out for the right hand and nevercould finish a pair in his lifeno doubt his notions of skincutting arerather different said henry but with yourleave father i would only say that work heor be he idle he has no bleared eyes no handsseared with the hot iron and walked by theuse of the forehammer no hair rusted in thesmoke and singed in the furnace like the hideof a badger rather than what is fit to be coveredwith a christian bonnet now let catharinebe as good a wench as ever lived and i will upholdher to be the best in perth yet she mustsee and know that these things make a differencebetwixt man and man and that the differenceis not in my favourhere is to thee with all my heart sonharry said the old man filling a brimmer tohi companion and another to himself u i seethat good smith as thou art thou keenest notthe mettle that women are made of thou mustbe bold henry and bear thyself not as if thouwert going to the gallowlee but like a gay youngfellow who knows his own worth and will notbe slighted by the best grandchild eve everhad catharine is a woman like her motherand thou thickest foolishly to suppose they areall set on what pleases the eye their ear mustbe pleased too man they must know that hewhom they favour is bold and buxom andmight have the love of twenty though he isseeing for theirs believe an old man womenwalk more by what others think than by whatthey think themselves and when she asks forthe boldest man in perth whom shall she hearnamed but harry burnthewind the bestarmourer that ever fashioned weapon on anvil why harry smith again the tightest dancerat the maypole why the lusty smith thegayest troller of ballads why who but harrygow the best wrestler swordandbucklerplayer the king of the weaponshowing thebreaker of mud horses the tamer of wild highlander ever more it is thee thee no onebut thee and shall catharine prefer yonderslip of a highland boy to thee pshaw shemight as well make a steel gauntlet out of kid'sleather i tell thee conachar is nothing toher but so far as she would fain prevent thedevil having his due of him as of other highlander god bless her poor thing she wouldbring all mankind to better thoughts if shecouldm in which she will fail to a certainty saidthe smith who as the reader may have noticedhad no good will to the highland racei will wager on old nick of whom i shouldknow something he being indeed a worker inthe same element with myself against catharineon that debate the devil will have thetartan that is sure enoughay but catharine replied the gloverhath a second thou knowest little of fatherclement has taken the young reiver inhand and he fears a hundred devils as littleas i do a flock of geese father clement said the smith youare always making some new saint in this godlycity of saint johnston pray who for adevil's drubber may he be one of your hermitsthat is trained for the work like a wrestlerfor the ring and brings himself to trim by fastingand penance is he not no that is the marvel of it said simon father clement eats drinks and lives muchlike other folks all the rules of the churchnevertheless strictly observedoh i comprehend a buxom priest thatthinks more of good living than of good lifetipplea can on eastern's eve to enable him toface lent has a pleasant in principio andconfesses all the prettiest women about town you are on the bowhand still smith itell you my daughter and i could nose out eithera fasting hypocrite or a full one but fatherclement is neither the one nor the otherbut what is he then in heaven's name one who is either greatly better than halfhis brethren of saint johnston put togetheror so much worse than the worst of them thatit is sin and shame that he is suffered to abidein the countrymethinks it were easy to tell whether hebethe one or the other said the smithcontent you my friend said simonwith knowing that if you judge father clementby what you see him do and hear him sayyou will think of him as the best and kindestman in the world with a comfort for everyman's grief a counsel for every man's difficultythe rich man's surest guide and the poor man'sbest friend but if you listen to what the dominicanssay of him he is benedicite herethe glover crossed himself on brow and bosom a foul heretic who ought by means of earthlyflames to be sent to those which burn eternallythe smith also crossed himself and exclaimed saint mary father simon and do youwho are so good and prudent that you havebeen called the wise glover of perth let yourdaughter attend the ministry of one who thesaints preserve us may be in league with thefoul fiend himself why was it not a priestwho raised the devil in the meal vermes whenhodge jackson's house was blown down in thegreat wind did not the devil appear in themidst of the tay dressed in a priest's scapulargambolling like a peach amongst the wavesthe morning when our stately bridge was sweptaway i cannot tell whether he did or no saidthe glover i only know i saw him not asto catharine she cannot be said to use fatherclement's ministry seeing her confessor is oldfather francis the dominican from whom shehad her shrift today but women will sometimesbe wilful and sure enough she consultswith father clement more than i could wish and yet when i have spoken with him myselfi have thought him so good and holy a manthat i could have trusted my own salvation withhim there are bad reports of him among thedominicans that is certain but what have welaymen to do with such things my son let uspay mother church her dues give our almsconfess and do our penances duly and thesaints will bear us outay truly and they will have consideration said the smith for any rash and unhappyblow that a man may deal in a fightwhen his party was on defence and standingup to him and that's the only creed a mancan live upon in scotland let your daughterthink what she pleases marry a man mustknow his fence or have a short lease of his lifein any place where blows are going so rife fivenobles to our altar have cleared me for the bestman i ever had misfortune withlet us finish our flask then said the oldglover for i reckon the dominican tower istolling midnight and hark thee son henry beatthe lattice win do won our eastgableby the verypeep of dawn and make me aware thou art comeby whistling the smith's call gently i will contrivethat catharine shall look out at the windowand thus thou wilt have all the privilegesof being a gallant valentine through the rest ofthe year which if thou canst not use to thineown advantage i shall be led to think that forall thou best covered with the lion's hide naturehas left on thee the long ears of the assamen father said the armourer ahearty good night to you and

himself in his cloak and hastenedthrough the still silent streets determined toappear at the window appointed a little beforedawnwith this purpose he passed up the highstreet and turned down the opening wheresaint john's church now stands in order toproceed to curfew street when it occurred tohim from the appearance of the sky that hewas at least an hour too early for his purposeand that it

advancedas it were by concert to intercept his passagethe imperfect light only permitted him todiscern that they wore the highland mantleclear the way cathedral said the armourerin the deep stern voice which correspondedwith the breadth of his chestthey did not answer at least intelligiblybut he could see that they drew their swordswith the purpose of withstanding him by violenceconjecturing some evil but of whatkind he could not anticipate henry instantlydetermined to make his way through whateverodds and defend his mistress or at leastdie at her feet he cast his cloak over hisleft arm as a buckler and advanced rapidly andsteadily to the two men the nearest made a thrustat him but henry smith parrying the blow withhis cloak dashed his arm in the man's face andtripping him at the same time gave him a severefall on the causeway while almost at the sameinstant he struck a blow with his linger at thefellow who was upon his right hand so severelyapplied that he also lay prostrate by his associatemeanwhile the armourer pushed forwardin alarm for which the circumstances ofthe street being guarded or defended by strangerswho conducted themselves with such violenceafforded sufficient reason he heard a suppressedwhisper and a bustle under the glover'swindows those very windows from which hehad expected to be hailed by catharine as hervalentine he kept to the opposite

the sentinels asked in a whisper what noise was yonder kenneth whygave you not the signal villain said henry you are discoveredand you shall die the death as he spoke thus he dealt the stranger ablow with his weapon which would probablyhave made his words good had not the manraising his arm received on his hand the blowmeant for his head the wound must have beena severe one for he staggered and fell with adeep groan without noticing him farther henrysmith sprung forward upon a party of menwho seemed engaged in placing a ladder againstthe lattice window in the gable henry did notstop either to count their numbers or to ascertaintheir purpose but crying the alarmwordof the town and giving the signal at which theburghers were wont to collect he rushed on thenight walkers one of whom was in the act ofascending the ladder the smith seized it bythe rounds threw it down on the pavement andplacing his foot on the body of the man who hadbeen mounting prevented him from regaininghis feet his accomplices struck fiercely athenry to extricate their companion but hismailcoat stood him in good stead and he repaidtheir blows with interest shouting aloudhelp help for bonnie st johnston bowsand

from the street shehad sunk on her knees to pray for assistanceand when she distinguished the voices of neighboursand friends collected for her protectionshe remained in the same posture to returnthanks she was still kneeling when her fatheralmost thrust her champion henry smithinto her apartment the bashful lover hangingback at first as if afraid to give offenceand on observing her posture from respect toher devotionfather said the armourer she prays vol i ki dare no more speak to her than to a bishopwhen he says massnow go thy ways for a right valiant andcourageous blockhead

teaches us that trick besides enoughare awake and astir to ensure us peace and quiettill morning so come in this wayso saying he drew henry nothing loathinto the same apartment where they had suppedand where the old woman who was on footdisturbed as others had been by the nocturnalaffray soon roused up the fireand now my doughty son said the glover what liquor wilt thou pledge thy fatherinhenry smith had suffered himself to sinkmechanically upon a seat of old black oak andnow gazed on the fire that flashed back a ruddylight over his manly features he muttered tohimself half audibly good henry bravehenry ah had she but said dear henry what liquors be these said the old gloverlaughing my cellar holds none such but if sack or rhenish or wine of gasconycan serve why say the

kid's leather mansaid the glover if thou wilt but be ruledand say what thou wilt take for thy morning'sdraughtwhatever thou wilt father answered thearmourer carelessly and relapsed into the analysisof catharine's speech to him she spokeof my warm heart but she also spoke of myreckless hand what earthly thing can i doto get rid of that fighting fancy certainlyi were best strike my right hand off and nailit to the door of a church that it may never domediscredit moreyou have chopped off hands enough for onenight said his friend setting a flagon of wineon the table why dost thou vex thyselfman she

father not onlyconsenting to the cutting out of the match butwilling to see you two as closely united togetheras ever needle stitched buckskin r and with allthis on thy side fortune father and all thouloosest like a distracted lover in a ballad morelike to pitch thyself into the tay than to wooa lass that may be had for the asking if youcan but choose the lucky minuteay but that lucky minute father i questionmuch if catharine ever has such a momentto glance on earth and its inhabitants as mightlead her to listen to a coarse ignorant borrelman like me i cannot tell how it is father elsewhere i can hold up my head like anotherman but with your saintly daughter i lose heartand courage and i cannot help thinking that itwould be well nigh robbing a holy shrine if icould succeed in surprising her affections herthoughts are too much fitted for heaven to bewasted on such a one as i ame'en as you like henry answered theglover my daughter is not courting you anymorethan i am a fair offer is no cause of feud only if you think that i will give into her foolishnotions of a convent take it with you thati will never listen to them i love and honourthe church he said crossing himself i payher rights duly and cheerfully tithes and almswine and wax i pay them as justly i say asany man in perth of my means doth but i cannotafford the church my only and single ewelambthat i have in

for ever and not sooner but as foryou friend gow i pray you will act accordingto your own best liking i want to force nowife on you i promise younay now you beat the iron twice oversaid henry it is thus we always end fatherby your being testy with me for not doingthat thing in the world which would makeme happiest were i to have it in my powerwhy father i would the keenest dirk i everforged were sticking in my heart at this momentif there is one single particle in it that is notmore your daughter's property than my ownbut what can i do i cannot think less of heror more of myself than we both deserve andwhat seems to you so easy and certain is to measdifficult as it would be to work a steel hauberkout of hards of flax but here is to youfather he added in a more cheerful tone and here is to my fair saint and valentineas i hope your catharine will be mine for theseason and let me not keep your old headlonger from the pillow but make interest withyour featherbed till daybreak and then youmust be my guide to your daughter's chamberdoorand my apology for entering it to bid hergood morrow for the brightest that the sun willawaken in the city or for miles round it no bad advice my son said the honestglover but you what will you do willyou lie down beside me or take a part of conachar'sbed neither answered harry gow ishould but prevent your rest and for me thiseasychair is worth a down bed and i will sleeplike a sentinel with my graith about meas he spoke he laid his hand on his swordnay heaven send us no more need of weapons good night or rather good morrowtill daypeep and the first who wakes calls upthe otherthus parted the two burghers the gloverretired to his bed and it is to be supposed torest the lover was not so fortunate his bodilyframe easily bore the fatigue which he hadencountered in the course of the night but hisi mind was of a different and more delicatemould in one point of view he was but thestout burgher of his period proud alike of hisart in making weapons and wielding themwhen made his professional jealousy personalstrength and skid in the use of arms broughthim into many quarrels which had made himgenerally feared and in some instances dislikedbut with these qualities were unitedthe simple goodnature of a child and at thesame time an imaginative and enthusiastic temperwhich seemed little to correspond with hislabours at the forge or his combats in the fieldperhaps a little of the hairbrained and ardentfeeling which he had picked out of old balladsor from the metrical romances which were hissole source of information or knowledge mayhave been the means of pricking him on to someof his achievements which had often a rudestrain of chivalry in them at least it was certainthat his love to the fair catharine had in itadelicacy such as might have become the squireof low degree who was honoured if song speakstruth with the smiles of the king of hungary'sdaughter his sentiments towards her were certainlyas exalted as if they had been fixed uponan actual angel which made old simon andothers who watched his conduct think that hispassion was too high and devotional to be successfulwith maiden of mortal mould theywere mistaken however catharine coy andreserved as she was had a heart which couldfeel and understand the nature and depth of thearmourer's passion and whether she was ableto repay it or not she had as much secret pridein the attachment of the redoubted henry gownsa lady of romance may be supposed to havein the company of a tame lion who follows toprovide for and defend her it was with sentimentsof the most sincere gratitude that sherecollected as she awoke at dawn the servicesof henry during the course of the eventfulnight and the first thought which she dweltupon was the means of making him understandher feelingsarising hastily from bed and half blushingat her own purpose i have been cold to himand perhaps unjust i will not be ungratefulshe said to herself though i cannot yield tohis suit i will not wait till my father compelsme to receive him as my valentine for the year i will seek him out and choose him myself ihave thought other girls bold when they didsomething like this but i shall thus best pleasemy father and but discharge the rites due togood saint valentine by showing my gratitudeto this brave manhastily slipping on her dress which neverthelesswas left a good deal more disorderedthan usual she tripped down stairs and openedthe door of the chamber in which as she hadguessed her lover had passed the hours afterthe fray catharine paused at the door andbecame half afraid of executing her purposewhich not only permitted but enjoined the valentinesof the year to begin their connexionwith a kiss of affection it was looked upon asapeculiarly propitious omen if the one partycould find the other asleep and awaken him orher by performance of this interesting ceremonynever was a fairer opportunity offered forcommencing this mystic tic than that whichnow presented itself to catharine after manyand various thoughts sleep had at length overcomethe stout armourer in the chair in whichhe had deposited himself his features in reposehad a more firm and manly cast than catharinehad thought who having generally seenthem fluctuating between shamefacedness andapprehension of her displeasure had been usedto connect with them some idea of imbecilityhe looks very stern she said if heshould be angry and then when he awakes we are alone if i should call dorothy if ishould wake my father but no it is a thingof custom and done in all maidenly and sisterlylove and honour i will not suppose that henrycan misconstrue it and i will not let a childishfear put my gratitude to sleepso saying she tripped along the floor of theapartment with a light though hesitating stepand a cheek crimsoned at her own purpose andgliding to the chair of the sleeper dropped akiss upon his lips as light as if a roseleaf hadfallen on them the slumbers must have beenslight which such a touch could dispel andthe dreams of the sleeper must needs have beenconnected with the cause of the interruptionsince henry instantly starting up caught themaiden in his arms and attempted to returnin ecstasy the salute which had broken his reposebut catharine struggled in his embrace and as her efforts implied alarmed modestyrather than maidenly coyness her bashful loversuffered her to escape a grasp from whichtwenty times her strength could not have extricatedhernay be not angry good henry said catharinein the kindest tone to her surprisedlover i have paid my vows to saint valentineto show how i value the mate which hehas sent me for the year let but my fatherbe present and i will not dare to refuse theethe revenge you may claim for a broken sleeplet not that be a hinderance said the oldglover rushing in ecstasy into the room toher smith to her strike while the iron ishot and teach her what it is not to let sleepingdogs lie stillthus encouraged henry though perhapswith less alarming vivacity again seized theblushing maiden in his arms who submittedwith a tolerable grace to receive repayment ofher salute a dozen times repeated and with anenergy very different from that which had provokedsuch severe retaliation at length sheagain extricated herself from her lover's armsand as if frightened and repenting what shehad done threw herself into a seat and coveredher face with her handscheer up thou silly girl said her fatherand be not ashamed that thou hast made thetwo happiest men in perth since thy old fatheris one of them never was kiss so well bestowedand meet it is that it should be suitably returnedlook up my darling look up and letme see thee but give one smile by my honestword the sun that now rises over our fair cityshows no sight that can give me greater pleasure what he continued in a jocose tonethou though st thou hadst jamie eddie'sring and couldst walk invisible but not so myfairy of the dawning just as i was about torise i heard tby chamber door open and watchedthee down stairs not to protect thee againstthis sleepyheaded henry but to see with myown delighted eyes my beloved girl do thatwhich her father most wished come putdown these foolish hands and though thoublushes a little it will only the better gracest valentine's morn when blushes best becomea maiden's cheekas simon glover spoke he pulled awaywith gentle violence the hands which hid hisdaughter's face she blushed deeply indeedbut there was more than maiden's shame in herface and her eyes were fast filling with tearswhat weeping love continued her father nay nay this is more than need henry help me to comfort this little foolcatharine made an effort to collect herselfand to smile but the smile was of a melancholyand serious casti only meant to say father said the fairmaid of perth with continued exertion thatin choosing henry gow for my valentine andrendering to him the rights and greeting of thevol i imorning according to wonted custom i meantbat to show my gratitude to him for his manlyand faithful service and my obedience toyou but do not lead him to think and ohdearest father do not yourself entertain an ideathat i meant more than what the promise to behis faithful and affectionate valentine throughthe year requires of meay ay ay ay we understand it allsaid simon in the soothing tone which nursesapply to children we understand what themeaning is enough for once enough for oncethou shalt not be frightened or hurried lovingtrue and faithful valentines are ye andthe rest as heaven and opportunity shall permitcome prithee have

theeah health to the soul of thy dearest motherhe added with a sigh how blithe would shehave been to see this happy st valentine'smorning catharine took the opportunity of escapewhich was thus given her and glided from theroom to henry it seemed as if the sun haddisappeared from the heaven at midday and leftthe world in sudden obscurity even the highswelledhopes with which the late incident hadfilled him began to quail as he reflected uponher altered demeanour the tears in her eyes the obvious fear which occupied her features and the pains she had taken to show as plainlyas delicacy would permit that the advanceswhich she had made to him were limited to thecharacter with which the rites of the day hadinvested him her father looked on his fallencountenance with something like surprise anddispleasurein the name of good st john what has befallenyou that makes you look as grave as anowl when a lad of your spirit having reallysuch a fancy for this poor girl as you pretendought

holidaymorn i want no more bloody puddingsthe youth entered accordingly his face waspale his eyes red and there was an air of discomposureabout his whole person he satedown at the lower end of the table opposite todorothy and crossed himself as if preparingfor his morning's meal as he did not helphimself to any food catharine offered him aplatter containing some of the cakes which hadmet with such general approbation at firsthe rejected her offered kindness rather sullenly but on her repeating the offer with a smile ofgood will he took a cake in his hand broke itand was about to eat a morsel when the effortto swallow seemed almost too much for him and though he succeeded he did not repeat ityou have a bad appetite for saint valentine'smorning conachar said his goodhumouredmaster

a laugh farewell and ithank you for your kindness which has beenmore than i deserved if i have at times seemedless than thankful it was the fault of circumstancesand not of my will catharine hecast upon the maiden a look of strong emotionin which various feelings were blended he hesitatedas if to say something and at lengthturned away with the single woidfarewell fiveminutes afterwards with highland buskins onhis feet and a small bundle in his hand hepassed through the north gate of perth and directedhis course to the highlandsthere goes enough of beggary and of pridefor a whole highland clan said henry hetalks as familiarly of gold pieces as i would ofsilver pennies and yet i will be sworn that thethumb of his mother's worsted glove might holdthe treasure of the whole clanlike enough said the glover laughing atthe idea his mother was a largeboned womanespecially in the fingers and wristand as for cattle continued henry ireckon his father and brothers steal sheep byone at a timethe less we say of them the better saidthe glover becoming again grave rt brothershe hath none his father is a powerful man hath long hands reaches as far as he can andhears farther than it is necessary to talk ofhimand yet he hath bound his only son apprenticeto a glover in perth said henrywhy i should have thought the gentle craftas it is called of st crispin would have suitedhim best and that if the son of some great macor o was to become an artizan it could only bein the craft where princes set him the examplethis remark though ironical seemed to awayi kken our friend simon's sense of professionaldignity which was a prevailing feeling thatmarked the manners of the artizans of the timeyou err son henry he replied with muchgravity the glovers are the more honourablecraft of the two in regard they providefor the accommodation of the hands whereasthe shoemakers and cordwainers do but workfor the feetboth equally necessary members of thebody corporate said henry whose father hadbeen a cordwainerit may be so my son said the glover but not both alike honourable bethink youthat we employ the hands as pledges of friendshipand good faith and the feet have no such privilegebrave men fight with their hands cowards employ their feet in flight a gloveis borne aloft a shoe is trampled in the mire a man greets a friend with his open handhe spurns a dog or one whom he holds as meanas a dog with his advanced foot a glove onthe point of a spear is a sign and pledge offaith all the wide world over as a gauntletflung down is a gage of knightly battle whilei know no other emblem belonging to an oldshoe except that some crones will fling themafter a man by way of good luck in whichpractice i avow myself to entertain no confidencem nay said the smith amused with hisfriend's eloquent pleading for the dignity of theart he practised i am not the man i promiseyou to disparage the glover's mystery bethinkyou i am myself a maker of gauntletsbut the dignity of your ancient craft removesnot my wonder that the father of this conchasuffered his son to learn a trade of anykind from a lowland craftsman holding usas they do altogether beneath their magnificentdegree and a race of contemptible drudges unworthyof any other fate than to be ill usedand plundered as often as these barebreechesdunniewassals see safety and convenience fordoing soay answered the glover but therewere powerful reasons for for hewithheld something which seemed upon hislips and went on for conaclmr's father actingas he did well i have played fair withhim and i do not doubt but he will act honourablyby me butconachar's sudden leavetakinghas put me to some inconvenience hehad things under his charge i must lookthrough the boothcan i help you father said henry undeceivedby the earnestness of his manneryou no said simon with a drynesswhich made henry so sensible of the simplicityof his proposal that he blushed to the eyes athis own dulness of comprehension in a matterwhere love ought to have induced him to takehis cue easily up you catharine said theglover as he left the room entertain yourvalentine for five minutes and see he departsnot till my return come hither with me olddorothy and bestir thy limbs in my behalfhe left the room followed by the old woman and henry smith remained with catharine almostfor the first time in his life entirely alonethere was embarrassment on the maiden's partand awkwardness on that of the lover for aboutuaminute when henry calling up his couragepulled the gloves put of his pocket with whichsimon had supplied him and asked her to permitone who had been so highly graced thatmorning to pay the usual penalty for beingasleep at the moment when he would havegiven the slumbers of a whole twelvemonth tobe awake for a single minutenay but said catharine the fulfilmentof my homage to st valentine infers no suchpenalty as you desire to pay and i cannottherefore think of accepting themthese gloves said henry advancing hisseat insidiously towards catharine as he spokewere wrought by the hands that are dearestto you and see they are shaped for yourown he extended them as he spoke and takingher arm in his robust hand spread the glovesbeside it to show how well they fitted lookat that taper arm he said look at thesesmall fingers think who sewed these seams ofsilk and gold and think whether the gloveand the arm which alone the glove can fit oughtto remain separate because the poor glove hashad the misfortune to be for a passing minutein the keeping of a hand so swart and rough asminethey are welcome as coming from my fathersaid catharine and surely not less soas coming from my friend and there was anemphasis on the word as well as my valentineand preserverlet me aid to do them on said the smithbringing himself yet closer to her side theymay seem a little over tight at first and youmay require some assistanceyou are skilful in such service good henrygow said the maiden smiling but at thesame time drawing farther from her loverin good faith no said henry shaking hishead my experience has been in donningsteel gauntlets on mailed knights more than infitting embroidered gloves upon maidensi will trouble you then no further anddorothy shall aid me though there needs no assistance my father's eye and fingers are faithfulto his craft what work he puts through hishands is always true to the measurelet me be convinced of it said the smith let me see that these slender gloves actuallymatch the hands they were made forsome other time good henry answeredthe maiden i will wear the gloves in honourof st valentine and the mate he has sent me forthe season i would to heaven i could pleasuremy father as well in weightier matters at presentthe perfume of the leather harms the headachi have had since morningheadeach dearest maiden echoed herloverif you call it heartach you will not misnameit said catharine with a sigh and proceededto speak in a very serious tone henryshe said i am going perhaps to be asbold as i gave you reason to think me thismorning for i am about to speak the first upona subject on which it may well be i ought towait till i had to answer you but i cannotafter what has happened this morning suffer myfeelings towards you to remain unexplainedwithout the possibility of my being greatly misconceived nay do not answer till you haveheard me out you are brave henry beyondmost men honest and true as the steel youwork upon stop stop catharine for mercy's sake you never said so much that was good concerningme save to introduce some bitter censureof which your praises were the harbingersi am honest and so forth you would say butahotbrained brawler and common shorteror stabberi should injure both myself and you incalling you such no henry to no commonstabber had he worn a plume in his bonnetand gold spurs on his heels would catharineglover have offered the little grace she has thisday voluntarily done to you if i have at timesdwelt severely upon the proneness of your spiritto anger and of your hand to strife it is becausei would have you if i could so persuadeyou hate in yourself the sins of vanity andwrath by which you are most easily beset ihave spoken on the topic more to alarm yourown conscience than to express my opinion iknow as well as my father that in thcbe forcelord and desperate days the whole customs ofour nation nay of every christian nation maybequoted in favour of bloody quarrels for triflingcauses of the taking deadly and deep revengefor slight offences and the slaughter ofeach other for emulation of honour or often inmere sport but i know that for all thesethings we shall one day be called into judgment and fain would i convince thee mybrave and generous friend to listen oftener tothe dictates of thy good heart and take lesspride in the strength and dexterity of thy unsparingarmi am i am convinced catharine exclaimedhenry thy words shall henceforwardbe a law to me i have done enoughfar too much indeed for proof of my bodilystrength and courage but it is only from youcatharine that i can learn a better way ofthinking remember my fair valentine thatmy ambition of distinction in arms and mylove of strife if it can be called such do notfight evenhanded with my reason and mymilder dispositions but have their patrons andsticklers to egg them on is there a quarrel and suppose that i thinking on your counselsam something loth to engage in it believeyou i am left to decide between peace or war atmy own choosing not so by st mary thereare a hundred round me to stir me on whyhow now smith is thy mainspring rusted saysone jolly henry is deaf on the quarrellingear this morning says another stand to itfor the honour of perth says my lord the provost harry against them for a gold noblecries your father perhaps now what can apoor fellow do catharine when all are hallooinghim on in the devil's name and not a soulputting in a word on the other side nay i know the devil has factors enoughto utter his wares said catharine but it isour duty to despise such idle arguments thoughthey may be pleaded even by those to whom weowe much love and honourthen there are the minstrels with theirromaunt and ballads which place all a man'spraise in receiving and repaying hard blowsit is sad to tell catharine how many of mysins that blind harry the minstrel hath to answerfor when i hit a downright blow it isnot so save me st john to do any maninjury but only to strike as william wallacestruckthe minstrels namesake spoke this in sucha tone of rueful seriousness that catharinecould scarce forbear smiling but neverthelessshe assured him that the danger of his own andother men's lives ought not for a moment to beweighed against such simple toysay but replied henry emboldened byher smiles methinks now the good cause ofpeace would thrive all the better for an advocatesuppose for example that when i am pressedand urged to lay hand on my weapon i couldhave cause to recollect that there was a gentleand guardian angel at home whose image wouldseem to whisper henry do no violence itis my hand which you crimson with blood henry rush upon no idle danger it is mybreast which you expose to injury suchthoughts would do more to restrain my moodthan if every monk in perth should cry holdthy hand on pain of bell book and candle if such a warning as could be given by thevoice of sisterly affection can have weight in thedebate said catharine do think that in strikingyou empurple this hand that in receivingwounds you harm this heartthe smith took courage at the sincerely affectionatetone in which these words were deliveredand wherefore not stretch your regard adegree beyond these cold limits why since youare so kind and generous as to own some interestin the poor ignorant sinner before youshould you not at once adopt him as your scholarand your husband your father desires it the town expects it glovers and smiths arepreparing their rejoicing and you only youwhose words are so fair and so kind you willnot give your consent henry said catharine in a low and tremulousvoice believe me i should hold it myduty to comply with my father's commandswere there not obstacles invincible to thematch which he proposesfcc yet think think but for a moment have little to say for myself in comparison ofyou who can both read and write but theni wish to hear reading and could listen to

what thou knowestof this matterour smith told his story to the same purposewhich we have already related and the meddlingmaker of bonnets added as before andthou safest me there honest smith didst thounot not i in good faith neighbour answeredhenry but you are a little man you knowand i might overlook youthis reply produced a laugh at oliver's expensewho laughed for company but addedm i was one of the foremost to the rescue for allthatwhy where wert thou then neighbour said the smith for i saw you not and iwould have given the worth of the best suit ofarmour i ever wrought to have seen as stout afellow as thou at my elbowi was no farther off however honest smith and whilst thou wert laying on blows as if on ananvil i was parrying those that the rest of thevillains aimed at thee behind

wavingto master proudfute an injunction of silencethe precognition of simon glover and henrygow would bear out a matter less worthy ofbelief and now my masters your opinionwhat should be done here are all our burgherrights broken through and insulted and youmay well fancy that it is by some man of powersince no less dared have attempted such an outragemy masters it is hard on flesh and bloodto submit to this the laws have framed us oflower rank than the princes and nobles yet itis against reason to suppose that we will sufferour houses to be broken into and the honour ofour women insulted without some redressit is not to be endured answered the citizensunanimouslyhere simon glover interfered with a veryanxious and ominous countenance i hopestill that all was not meant so ill as it seemedto us my worthy neighbours and i for onewould cheerfully forgive the alarm and disturbanceto my poor house providing the fair citywere not brought into jeopardy for me i beseechyou to consider

our wrongs the pretencefor squeezing money out of uswe will none of albany for our judge'answered the meeting with the same unanimityas beforeor perhaps added simon he will bidthe duke of rothsay take charge of it and thewild young prince will regard the outrage assomething for his gay companions to scoff atand his minstrels to turn into a songaway with rothsay he is too gay to beour judge again exclaimed the citizenssimon emboldened by seeing he was reachingthe point he aimed at yet pronouncing thedreaded name with a half whisper next addedwould you like the black douglas better todeal with there was no answer for a minute theylooked on each other with fallen countenancesand blanched lips but henry smith spoke outboldly and in a decided voice the sentimentswhich all felt but none else dared give wordstothe black douglas to judge betwixt aburgher and a gentleman nay a nobleman forall i know or care the black devil of hellsooner you are mad father simon so muchas to name so wild a proposalthere was again a silence of fear and uncertaintywhich was at length broken by bailiecraigdallie who looking very significantly tothe speaker replied you are confident in astout doublet neighbour smith or you wouldnot talk so boldlyi am confident of a good heart under mydoublet such as it is bailie answered the undauntedhenry and though i speak but littlemy mouth shall never be padlocked by anynoble of them allwear a thick doublet good henry or donot speak so loud reiterated the bailie in thesame significant tone there are border meninthe town who wear the bloody heart on theirshoulder but all this is no rede what shallwe do short rede good rede said the smithlet us to our provost and demand his countenanceand assistancea murmur of applause went through theparty and oliver proudfute exclaimed thatis what i have been saying for this half hourand not one of ye would listen to me let usgo to our provost said i he is a gentlemanhimself and ought to come between the burghand the nobles in all mattershush neighbours hush be wary whatyou say or do said a thin meagre figure of aman whose diminutive person seemed still morereduced in size and more assimilated to a shadowby his efforts to assume an extreme degreeof humility and make himself to suit his argumentlook meaner yet and yet more insignificantthan nature had made himm pardon me said he i am but a poor nevertheless i have been bred in parisand learned my humanities and my cursus mededias well as some that call themselves learnedleeches methinks i can tent this woundand treat it with emollients here is our friendsimon glover who is as you all know a manof worship think you he would not be themost willing of us all to pursue harsh courseshere since his family honour is so nearly concerned and since he blenches away from thecharge against these same revellers consider ifhe may not have some good reason more thanhe cares to utter for letting the matter sleep itis not for me to put my finger on the sore butalack we all know that young maidens arewhat i call fugitive essences suppose now anhonest maiden i mean in all innocence leavesher window unlatched on st valentine's mornthat some gallant cavalier may in all honestyi mean become her valentine for the season and suppose the gallant be discovered may shenot scream out as if the visit were unexpectedand and bray all this in a mortar and thenconsider will it be a matter to place the townin feud for the pottingar delivered his opinion in a mostinsinuating manner but he seemed to shrinkinto something less than his natural tenuitywhen he saw the blood rise in the old cheeksof simon glover and inflame to the templesthe complexion of the redoubled smith thelast stepping forward and turning a stern lookon the alarmed pottingar broke out as follows thou walking skeleton thou asthmaticgallipot thou poisoner by profession ifi thought that the puff of vile breath thou hastleft could blight for the tenth part of a minutethe fair fame of catharine glover i wouldpound thee quacksalver in thine own mortarand beat up thy wretched carrion with flowerof brimstone the only real medicine in thybooth to make a salve to rub mangy houndswith hold son henry hold cried the gloverin a tone of authority no man has title tospeak of this matter but me worshipful bailiecraigdallie since such is the construction thatis put upon my patience i am willing to pursuethis riot to the uttermost and though theissue may prove that we had better have beenpatient you will all see that my catharine hathnot by any lightness or folly of hers affordedgrounds for this great scandalthe bailie also interposed u neighbour henrysaid he we came here to consult and notto quarrel as one of the fathers of the fair cityi command thee to forego all evil will and maltalentyou may have against master pottingardwining he is too poor a creature bailie saidhenry gow for me to harbour feud with i that could destroy him and his booth withone blow of my forehammerpeace then and hear me said the official we all are as much believers in the honour ofthe fair maiden of perth as in that of ourblessed lady here he crossed himself devoutly but touching our appeal to our provostare you agreed neighbours to put matter likethis into our provost's hand being against apowerful noble as is to be feared the provost being himself a nobleman squeaked the pottingar in some measure releasedfrom his terror by the intervention of thebailie god knows i speak not to the disparagementof an honourable gentleman whoseforebears have held the office he now holds formany years by free choice of the citizens of perthsaid the smith interrupting the speaker withthe tones of his deep and decisive voiceay surely said the disconcerted oratorby the voice of the citizens how else ipray you friend smith interrupt me not ispeak to our worthy and eldest bailie craigdalliedaccording to my poor mind i say thatcome amongst us how he will still this sir patrickcharter is is a nobleman and hawks willnot pick hawks eyes out he may well bearus out in a feud with the highlandmen anddo the part of our provost and leader againstthem but whether he that himself wears silk willtake our part against broidered cloak and clothof gold though he may do so against tartan andirish frieze is something to be questioned takea fool's advice we have saved our maiden ofwhom i never meant to speak harm as truly iknew none they have lost one man's handat least thanks to harry smith and to me added the little importantbonnetmakerand to oliver proudfute as he tells uscontinued the pottingar who contested no man'sclaim to glory provided he was not himselfcompelled to tread the perilous paths which leadto it i say neighbours since they have lefta hand as a pledge they will never come incouvrefew street again why in my simple mindwe were best to thank our stout townsman andthe town having the honour and these rakehellsthe loss that we should hush the matterup and say no more about itthese pacific counsels had their effect withsome of the citizens who began to nod andlook exceedingly wise upon the advocate of acquiescencewith whom notwithstanding

thereforeneighbours and good burghers of the fair cityof perth horse and mattock as i said beforeand meet me at the east porta general acclamation concluded the sittingof this species of privy council or lords of thearticles and they dispersed the deputation toprepare for the journey and the rest to tell theirimpatient wives and daughters of the measuresthey had taken to render their chambers safe infuture against the intrusion of gallants at unseasonablehourswhile nags are saddling and the towncouncildebating or rather putting in form whatthe leading members of their body had alreadyadopted it may be necessary for the informationof some readers to state in distinct termswhat is more circuitously intimated in the courseof the former discussionit was the custom at this period when thestrength of the feudal aristocracy controlled therights and frequently insulted the privileges ofthe royal burghs of scotland that the latterwhere it was practicable often chose their provostor chief magistrate not out of the orderof the merchants shopkeepers and citizens whoinhabited the town itself and filled up the rollof the ordinary magistracy but elected to thatpreeminent state some powerful nobleman orbaron in the neighbourhood of the burgh whowas expected to stand their friend at court insuch matters as concerned their common wealand to lead their civic militia to fight whetherin general battle or in private feud reinforcingthem with his own feudal retainers this protectionwas not always gratuitous the provostssometimes availed themselves of their situationto an unjustifiable degree and obtained grantsof lands and tenements belonging to the commongood or public property of the burgh andthus made the citizens pay dear for the countenancewhich they afforded others were satisfiedto receive the powerful aid of the townsmenin their own feudal quarrels with suchother marks of respect and benevolence as theburgh over which they presided were willing togratify them with in order to secure their activeservices in case of necessity the baron whowas the regular protector of a royal burgh acceptedsuch freewill offerings without scrupleand repaid them by defending the rights of thetown by arguments in the council and by bolddeeds in the fieldthe citizens of the town or as they lovedbetter to call it the fair city of perth had forseveral generations found a protector and provostof this kind in the knightly family of charterslords of kinfauns in the neighbourhoodof the burgh it was scarce a century in thetime of robert iii since the first of this distinguishedfamily had settled in the strong castlewhich now belonged to them with the picturesqueand fertile scenes adjoining to it butthe history of the first settler chivalrous andromantic in itself was calculated to facilitatethe settlement of an alien in the land in whichhis lot was cast we relate it as it is given byan ancient and uniform tradition which carriesin it great indications of truth and is warrantenough perhaps for its insertion in graver historiesthan the presentduring the brief career of the celebrated patriotsir william wallace and when his armshad for a time expelled the english invadersfrom his native country he is said to haveundertaken a voyage to france with a smallband of trusty friends to try what his presencefor he was respected through all countries forhis prowess might do to induce the frenchmonarch to send to scotland a body of auxiliaryforces or other assistance to aid the scotsin regaining their independencethe scottish champion was on board a smallvessel and steering for the port of dieppewhen a sail appeared in the distance which themariners regarded with doubt and apprehensionand at last with confusion and dismay wallacedemanded to know what was the cause of theiralarm the captain of the ship informed himthat the tall vessel which was bearing downwith the purpose of boarding that which hecommanded was the ship of a celebrated roverequally famed for his courage strength of bodyand successful piracies it was commanded bya gentleman named thomas de longueville afrenchman by birth but by practice one ofthose pirates who called themselves friends tothe sea and enemies to all who sailed upon thatelement he attacked and plundered vessels ofall nations like one of the ancient norse speakingas they were termed whose dominion weaponthe mountain waves the master addedthat no vessel could escape the rover hy flightso speedy was the bark he commanded and thatno crew however hardy could hope to resisthim when as was his usual mode of combat hethrew himself on board at the head of his followerswallace smiled sternly while the master ofthe ship with alarm in his countenance andtears in his eyes described to him the certaintyof their being captured by the red rovera name given to de longueville because heusually displayed the bloodred flag which hehad now hoistedi will clear the narrow seas of this roversaid wallacethen calling together some ten or twelve ofhis own followers boyd kerlie seton andothers to whom the dust of the most desperatebattle was like the breath of life he commandedthem to arm themselves and lie flat uponthe deck so as to be out of sight he orderedthe mariners below excepting such as were absolutelynecessary to manage the vessel and hegave the master instructions upon pain of deathso to steer as that while the vessel had anappearance of attempting to fly he should infact permit the red rover to come up withthem and do his worst wallace himself thenlay down on the deck that nothing might beseen which could intimate any purpose of resistancein a quarter of an hour de montreville'svessel ran on board that of the championand the red rover casting out grapplingirons to make sure of his prize jumpedon the deck in complete armour followedby his men who gave a terrible shout as ifvictory had been already secured but thearmed scots started up at once and the roverfound himself unexpectedly engaged withmen accustomed to consider victory as securewhen they were only opposed as one to two orthree wallace himself rushed on the piratecaptain and a dreadful strife began betwixtthem with such fury that the others suspendedtheir own battle to look on and seemed bycommon consent to refer the issue of the strifeto the fate of the combat between the twochiefs the pirate fought as well as man coulddo but wallace's strength was beyond thatof ordinary mortals he dashed the sword fromthe rover's hand and placed him in such perilthat to avoid being cut down he was fain toclose with the scottish champion in hopesof overpowering him in the grapple in thisalso he was foiled they fell on the deck lockedin each other's arms but the frenchman fell undermost and wallace fixing his grasp upon hisgorget compressed it so closely notwithstandingit was made of the finest steel that the bloodgushed from his eyes nose and mouth and hewas only able to ask for quarter by signs hismen threw down their weapons and begged formercy when they saw their leader thus severelyhandled the victor granted them all theirlives but took possession of their vessel anddetained them prisonerswhen he came in sight of the french harbourwallace alarmed the place by displayingthe rover's colours as if de longueville wascoming to pillage the town the bells were rungbackward horns were blown and the citizenswere hurrying to arms when the scene changedthe scottish lion on his shield of gold wasraised above the piratical flag and announcedthat the champion of scotland was approachinglike a falcon with his prey in his clutch helanded with his prisoner and carried him to thecourt of france where at wallace's request therobberies which the pirate had committed wereforgiven and the king even conferred the honourof knighthood on sir thomas de longuevilleand offered to take him into his service butthe rover had contracted such a friendship forhis generous victor that he insisted on unitinghis fortunes with those of wallace with whomhe returned to scotland and fought by his sidein many a bloody battle where the prowess ofsir thomas de longueville was remarked asinferior to that of none save of his heroic conquerorhis fate also was more fortunate thanthat of his patron being distinguished by thebeauty as well as strength of his person herendered himself so acceptable to a young ladyheiress of the ancient family of charteris thatshe choose him lor her husband bestowing onhim with her hand the fair baronial castle ofkinfauns and the domains annexed to it theirdescendants took the name of charteris as connectingthemselves with their maternal ancestorsthe ancient proprietors of the propertythough the name of thomas de longueville wasequally honoured amongst them and the largetwohanded sword with which he mowed theranks of war was and is still preserved amongthe family muniments another account isthat the family name of de longueville himselfwas charteris the estate afterwards passedto a family of blairs and is now the propertyof lord graythese barons of kinfauns from father to sonheld for several generations the office of provostof perth the vicinity of the castle andtown rendering it a very convenient arrangementfor mutual support the sir patrick ofthis history had more than once led out the menof perth to battles and skirmishes with the restlesshighland depredators and with other enemiesforeign and domestic true it is he usedsometimes to be weary of the slight and frivolouscomplaints unnecessarily brought beforehim and in which he was requested to interesthimself hence he had sometimes incurred thecharge of being too proud as a nobleman ortoo indolent as a man of wealth and one whowas too much addicted to the pleasures of thefield and the exercise of feudal hospitality tobestir himself upon all and every occasion whenthe fair town would have desired his active interferencebut notwithstanding that this occasionedsome slight murmuring the citizensupon any serious cause of alarm were wont torally around their provost and were warmlysupported by him both in council and actionchapter viithe character and quality of sir patrickcharteris the provost of perth being such aswe have sketched in the last chapter let us nowreturn to the deputation which was in the actof rendezvousing at the east port in order towait upon that dignitary with their complaintsat kinfaunsand first appeared simon glover on a pacingpalfrey which had sometimes enjoyed thehonour of bearing the fairer person as well as thelighter weight of his beautiful daughter hiscloak was muffled round the lower part of hisface as a sign to his friends not to interrupt himby any questions while he passed through thestreets and partly perhaps on account of thecoldness of the weather the deepest anxietywas seated on this brow as if the more he meditatedon the matter he was engaged in themore difficult and perilous it appeared heonly greeted by silent gestures his friends asthey came to the rendezvousa strong black horse of the old gallowaybreed of an under size not exceeding fourteenhands but high shouldered stronglimbed wellcoupledand roundbarrelled bore to the eastport the gallant smith a judge of the animalmight see in his eye a spark of that vicioustemper which is frequently the accompanimentof the form that is most vigorous and enduring but the weight the hand and the seat of therider added to the late regular exercise of along journey had subdued its stubbornness forthe present he was accompanied by the honestbonnetmaker who being as the reader isaware a little round man had planted himselflike a red pincushion for he was wrapped inascarlet cloak over which he had slung a hawkingpouch on the top of a great saddle whichhe might be said rather to be perched upon thanto bestride the saddle and the man were girthedon the ridgebone of a great trampling flemishmare with a nose turned up in the airlike a camel a huge fleece of hair at each footand every hoof full as large in circumference asafryingpan the contrast between the beastand the rider was so extremely extraordinarythat whilst chance passengers contented themselveswith wondering how he got up his friendswere anticipating with sorrow the perils whichmust attend his coming down again for the highseatedhorseman's feet did not by any meanscome beneath the laps of the saddle he hadassociated himself to the smith whose motionshe had watched for the purpose of joining him for it was oliver proudfute's opinion that menof action showed to most advantage when besideeach other and he was delighted whensome wag of the lower class had gravity enoughto cry out without laughing outright theregoes the pride of perth there go the slashingcraftsmen the jolly smith of the wynd andthe bold bonnetmaker it is true the fellow who gave this allhailthrust his tongue in his cheek to some scapegraceslike himself but as the bonnetmakerdid not see this byplay he generously threwhim a silver penny to encourage his respect formartialists this munificence occasioned theirbeing followed by a crowd of boys laughingand hallooing until henry smith turning backthreatened to switch the foremost of them aresolution which they did not wait to see putin executionhere are we the witnesses said the littleman on the large horse as they joined simonglover at the east port but where are theythat should back us ah brother henry authority is a load for an ass rather than a spiritedhorse it would but clog the motions ofsuch

pottingar as ifto discover in what limb or lineament of hiswasted face and form lay any appearance of themenaced danger and his examination reassuringhim he answered boldly blades andbucklers man i would stand the feud of adozen such as dwining what could he do toany man with blood in his veins he could give him a dose of physic answeredthe smith drilythey had no time for further colloquy forbailie craigdallie called to them to take the roadto kin fauns and himself showed the exampleas they advanced at a leisurely pace the discourseturned on the reception which they wereto expect from their provost and the interestwhich he was likely to take in the aggressionwhich they complained of the glover seemedparticularly desponding and talked more thanonce in a manner which implied a wish thatthey would yet consent to let the matter resthe did not speak out very plainly howeverfearful perhaps of the malignant interpretationwhich might be derived from any appearance ofhis flinching from the assertion of his daughter'sreputation dwining seemed to agree withhim in opinion but spoke more cautiously thanin the morningafter all said the bailie when i thinkof all the provinces and good

fromthe top of bis mare we fostering bladesnever bear so base a mind as to count for wineand walnuts with a friend like sir patrick chartersnay trust me a good woodsman likesir patrick will prize the right of hunting andsporting over the lands of the burgh as an highprivilege and one which his majesty the king'sgrace excepted is neither granted to lord norloon save to our provost aloneas the bonnetmaker spoke there was heardon the left hand the cry of so so ivaiv wawhaw being the shout of a falconer to hishawkmethinks yonder is a fellow using the privilegeyou mention who from his appearance isneither king nor provost said the smithay marry i see him said the bonnetmakerwho imagined the occasion presented aprime occasion to win honour thou and ijolly smith will prick towards him and puthim to the questionhave with you then cried the smith and his companion spurred his mare and wentoff never doubting that gow was at his heelsbut craigdallie caught henry's horse by thereins stand fast by the standard he said let us see the luck of our light horseman ifhe procures himself a broken pate he will bequieter for the rest of the dayfrom what i already see said the smithhe may easily come by such a boon yonderfellow who stops so impudently to look at usas if he were engaged in the most lawful sportin the world i guess him by his trotting noblerhis rusty headpiece with the cock's featherand long twohanded sword to be the followerof some of the southland lords men wholive so near the southron that the black jackis never off their backs and who are as free oftheir blows as they are light in their fingerswhilst they were thus speculating on theissue of the rencounter the valiant bonnetmakerbegan to pull up jezabel in order that thesmith who he still concluded was close behindmight overtake him and either advancefirst or at least abreast of himself but whenhe saw him at a hundred yards distance standingcomposedly with the rest of the groupthe flesh of the champion like that of the oldspanish general began to tremble in anticipationof the dangers into which his own venturousspirit was about to involve it yet the consciousnessof being countenanced by the neighbourhoodof so many friends the hopes that theappearance of such odds must intimidate thesingle intruder and the shame of abandoningan enterprise in which he had volunteered andwhen so many persons must witness his disgracesurmounted the strong inclination whichprompted him to wheel jezabel to the rightabout and return to the friends whose protectionhe had quitted as fast as her legs couldcarry them he accordingly continued his directiontowards the stranger who increased hisalarm considerably by putting his little nag inmotion and riding to meet him at a brisk troton observing this apparently offensive movementour hero looked over his left shouldermore than once as if reconnoitring the groundfor a retreat and in the meanwhile came to adecided halt but the philistine was upon himere the bonnetmaker could decide whether tofight or fly and a very ominouslooking philistinehe was his figure was gaunt and lathyhis visage marked by two or three illfavouredscars and the whole man had much the airof one accustomed to say stand and deliverto a true manthis individual began the discourse by exclaimingin tones as sinister as his looks the devil catch you for a cuckoo why do youride across the moor to spoil my sport worthy stranger said our friend in thetone of pacific remonstrance i am oliverproudfute a burgess of perth and a man ofsubstance and yonder is the worshipful adamcraigdallie the oldest bailie of the burgh withthe fighting smith of the wynd and three orfour armed men more who desire to know yourname and how you come to take your pleasureover these lands belonging to the burgh ofperth although natheless i will answer forthem it is not their wish to quarrel with agentleman or stranger for any accidental trespass only it is their use and wont not to grantsuch leave unless it is duly asked and andtherefore i desire to know your name worthysirthe grim and loathly aspect with which thefalconer had regarded oliver proudfute duringhis harangue had greatly disconcerted him andaltogether altered the character of the inquirywhich with henry gow to back him he wouldprobably have thought most fitting for the occasionthe stranger replied to it modified as it waswith a most inauspicious grin which the scarsof his visage made appear still more repulsiveyou want to know my name my name isthe devil's dick of hogarth well known inannandale for a gentle johnstonee i follow thestout laird of wamphray who rides with hiskinsman the redoubled lord of johnstonee whois banded with the doughty earl of douglas and the earl and the lord and the laird and ithe esquire fly our hawks where we find ourgame and ask no man whose ground we rideoverm i will do your message sir replied oliverproudfute meekly enough for he began to bevery desirous to get free of the embassy whichhe had so rashly undertaken and was in theact of turning his horse's head when the anmandateman added and take you this to boot to keep you inmind that you met the devil's dick and to teachyou another time to beware how you spoil thesport of any one who wears the flying spur onhis shoulderwith these words he applied two or threesmart blows of his ridingrod upon the lucklessbonnetmaker's head and person some of themlighted upon jezabel who turning sharplyround laid her rider upon the moor and gallopedback towards the party of citizensproudfute thus overthrown began to cry forassistance in no very manly voice and almost inthe same breath to whimper for mercy for hisantagonist dismounting almost as soon as hefell offered a linger or large wood knife tohis throat while he rifled the pockets of the unluckycitizen and even examined his hawkingbag swearing two or three grisly oaths that hewould have what it contained since the wearerhad interrupted his sport he pulled the beltrudely off terrifying the prostrate bonnetmakerstill more by the regardless violence which heused as instead of taking the pains to unbucklethe strap he drew till the fastening gave waybut apparently it contained nothing to his mindhe threw it carelessly from him and at the sametime suffered the dismounted cavalier to risewhile he himself remounted his hobbler andlooked towards the rest of oliver's party whowere now advancingwhen they had seen their delegate overthrownthere was some laughter so much hadthe vaunting humour of the bonnetmaker preparedhis friends to rejoice when as henrysmith termed it they saw their oliver meetwith a rowland but when the bonnetmaker'sadversary was seen to bestride him and handlehim in the manner described the armourer couldhold out no longer please you good masterbailie i cannot endure to see our townsmanbeaten and rifled and like to be murdered beforeus all it reflects upon the fair town and ifit is neighbour proudfute's misfortune it is ourshame i must to his rescuewe will all go to his rescue answeredbailie craigdallie but let no man strike withoutorder from me we have more feuds onour hands it is to be feared than we havestrength to bring to good end and therefore icharge you all more especially you henry of thewynd in the name of the fair city that youmake no stroke but in selfdefence they alladvanced therefore in a body and the appearanceof such a number drove the plunderer fromhis booty he stood at gaze however at somedistance like the wolf which though it retreatsbefore the dogs cannot be brought to absoluteflighthenry seeing this state of things spurred hishorse and advanced far before the rest of theparty up towards the scene of oliver proudfate'smisfortune his first task was to catchjezabel by the flowing rein and his next to leadher to meet her discomfited master who wascrippling towards him his clothes much soiledwith his fall his eyes streaming with tears frompain as well as mortification and altogether exhibitingan aspect so unlike the spruce and dapperimportance of his ordinary appearance thatthe honest smith felt compassion for the littleman and some remorse at having left lii exposedto such disgrace all men i believe enjoyan illnatured joke the difference is thatan illnatured person can drink out to verydregs the amusement which it affords whilethe bettermoulded mind soon loses the sense ofthe ridiculous in sympathy for the pain of thesuffereru let me pitch you up to your saddle againneighbour said the smith dismounting at thesame time and assisting oliver to scramble intohis warsaddle as a monkey might have donemay god forgive you neighbour smith fornot backing of me i would not have believedin it though fifty credible witnesses had swornit of yousuch were the first words spoken in sorrowmore than anger by which the dismayed olivervented his feelingsthe bailie kept hold of my horse by thebridle and besides henry continued with asmile which even his compassion could not suppress i thought you would have accused meof diminishing your honour if i brought you kaid against a single man but cheer up the villaintook foul odds of you your horse not beingwell at commandthat is true that is true said olivereagerly catching at the apologyand yonder stands the faitour rejoicing atthe mischief he has done and triumphing inyour overthrow like the king in the romancewho played upon the fiddle whilst a city wasburning come thou with me and thou shaltsee how we will handle him nay fear notthat i will desert thee this timeso

love tohear you speak in your own scholarly toneagain cheer up you have seen the villain'sback and regained the trophies you had lostwhen taken at advantageah henry gow henry gow said thebonnetmaker and stopped short vvitli a deepsigh nearly amounting to a groanwhat is the matter asked his friendwhat is it you vex yourself about now i have some suspicion my dearest friendhenry smith that the villain fled for fear ofyou not of me ido not think so replied the armourer he saw two men and fled and who can tellwhether he fled for one or the other besideshe knows by experience your strength and activity we all saw how you kicked and struggledwhen you were on the grounddid i said poor proudfute i do notremember it but i know it is my best point i am a strong dog in the loins but did theyall see itall as much as i said the smith smotheringan inclination to laughterbut thou wilt remind them of it be assured i will answered henry andof thy desperate rally even now mark whati say to bailie craigdallie and make the bestof itvol it is not that i require any evidence in myfavour for i am as brave by nature as mostmen in perth but only here the man ofvalour pausedbut only what inquired the

rest of them bailie craigdallielooks angry but it is not his kind of angerthat frightens meyou are to recollect gentle reader that assoon as the bailie and those who attendedhim saw that the smith had come up to theforlorn bonnetmaker and that the strangerhad retreated they gave themselves no troubleabout advancing further to his assistance whichthey regarded as quite insured by the presenceof the redoubled henry gow they had resumedtheir straight road to kinfauns desirousthat nothing should delay the execution of theirmission as some time had elapsed ere the and the smith rejoined the partybailie craigdallie asked them and henry smithin particular what they meant by dallying awayprecious time by riding up hill after the falconerby the mass it was not my fault masterbailie replied the smith if ye will coupleup an ordinary lowcountry greyhound with ahighland wolfdog you must not blame the firstof them for taking the direction in which itpleases the last to drag him on it was so andnot otherwise with my neighbour oliver proudfatehe no sooner got up from the ground buthe mounted his mare like a flash of lightningand enraged at the unsightly advantage whichyonder rascal had taken of his stumbling horsehe flew after him like a dromedary i could notbut follow both to prevent a second stumble andsecure our over bold friend and champion fromthe chance of some ambush at the top of thebill but the villain who is a follower of somelord of the marches and wears a winged spurfor his cognizance fled from our neighbour likefire from flintthe senior bailie of perth listened with surpriseto the legend which it had pleased gowto circulate for though not much caring forthe matter he had always doubted the bonnetmaker'sromancing account of his own exploitswhich hereafter he must hold as in some degreeorthodox the shrewd old glover looked closerinto the matteryou will drive the poor bonnetmakermad he whispered to henry and set himaringing his clapper as if he were a townbellon a rejoicing day when for order and decencyit were better he were silento by our lady father replied the smithi love the poor little braggadocio and couldnot think of his sitting rueful and silent inthe provost's hall while all the rest of themand in especial that venomous pottingar weretelling their mindthou art even too goodnatured a fellowhenry answered simon but mark thedifference betwixt these two men the harmlesslittle bonnetmaker assumes the airs of adragon to disguise his natural cowardice whilethe pottingar wilfully desires to show himselftimid poorspirited and humble to conceal thedanger of his temper the adder is not theless deadly that he creeps under a stone i tellthee son henry that for all his sneaking looksand timorous talking this wretched anatomyloves

horsechapter vinit was early in the afternoon of st valentine'sday that the prior of the dominicans was engagedin discharge of his duties as confessor toa penitent of no small importance this was anelderly man of a goodly presence a florid andhealthful cheek the under part of which wasshaded by a venerable white beard which descendedover his bosom the large and clear blueeyes with the broad expanse of brow expresseddignity but it was of a character which seemedmore accustomed to receive honours voluntarilypaid than to enforce them when they were refusedthe goodnature of the expression wasso great as to approach to defenceless simplicityor weakness of character unfit it might beinferred to repel intrusion or subdue resistanceamongst the grey locks of this personagewas placed a small circlet or coronet of goldupon a blue fillet his beads which were largeand conspicuous were of native gold rudelyenoughwrought but ornamented with scottishpearls of rare size and beauty these werehis only ornaments and a long crimson robe ofsilk tied by a sash of the same colour formedhis attire his shrift being finished he aroseheavily from the embroidered cushion uponwhich he kneeled during his confession and bythe assistance of a crutchheaded staff of ebonymoved lame and ungracefully and with apparentpain to a chair of state which surmountedby a canopy was placed for his accommodationby the chimney of the lofty and large apartmentthis was robert third of the name and thesecond of the illfated family of stewart who filledthe throne of scotland he had many virtuesand was not without talent but it was his greatmisfortune that like others of his devoted linehis merits were not of a kind suited to the partwhich he was called upon to perform in lifethe king of so fierce a people as the scots thenwere ought to have been warlike prompt andactive liberal in rewarding services strict inpunishing crimes one whose conduct shouldmake him feared as well as beloved the qualitiesof robert the third were the reverse ofall these in youth he had indeed seen battles but without incurring disgrace he had nevermanifested the chivalrous love of war and perilor the eager desire to distinguish himself by dangerousachievements which in that age was expectedfrom all who were of noble birth andhad claims to authoritybesides his military career was very shortamidst the tumult of a tournament the youngearl of carrick such was then his title receiveda kick from the horse of sir james douglasof dalkeith in consequence of which he waslame for the rest of his life and absolutely disabledfrom taking share either in warfare or inthe military sports and tournaments which wereits image as robert had never testified m suchpredilection for violent exertion he did not probablymuch regret the incapacities which exemptedhim from these active scenes but hismisfortune or rather its consequences loweredhim in the eyes of a fierce nobility and warlikepeople he was obliged to repose the principalcharge of his affairs now in one member now inanother of his family sometimes with the actualrank and always with the power of lieutenantgeneralof the kingdom his paternal affectionwould have induced him to use the assistanceof his eldest son a young man of spirit and talentwhom in fondness he had created duke ofrothsay in order to give him the present possessionof a dignity next to that of the thronebut the young prince's head was too giddy andhis hand too feeble to wield with dignity thedelegated sceptre however fond of powerpleasure was the prince's favourite pursuit and the court was disturbed and the countryscandalized by the number of fugitive amoursand extravagant revels practised by him whoshould have set an example of order and regularityto the youth of the kingdomthe license and impropriety of the duke ofrothsay's conduct was the more reprehensiblein the public view that he was a married person although some over whom his youth gaietygrace and good temper had obtained influencewere of opinion that an excuse for hislibertinism might be found in the circumstancesof the marriage itself they reminded each otherthat his nuptials were entirely conducted by hisuncle the duke of albany by whose counselsthe infirm and timid king was much governedat the time and who had the character of managingthe temper of his brother and sovereignso as might be most injurious to the interestsand prospects of the young heir by albany'smachinations the hand of the heir apparent wasin a manner put up to sale as it was understoodpublicly that the nobleman in scotlandwho should give the largest dower to his daughtermight aspire to raise her to the bed of theduke of rothsayin the contest for preference which ensuedgeorge earl of dunbar and march who possessedby himself or his vassals a great part ofthe eastern frontier was preferred to other competitors and his daughter was with the mutualgood will of the young couple actually contractedto the duke of rothsaybut there remained a third party to be consultedand that was no other than the tremendousarchibald earl of douglas terrible alikefrom the extent of his lands from the officesand jurisdictions with which he was investedand from his personal qualities of wisdom andvalour mingled with indomitable pride andmore than the feudal love of vengeance theearl was also nearly related to the throne havingmarried the eldest daughter of the reigningmonarchafter the espousals of the duke of rothsaywith the earl of march's daughter douglas asif he had postponed his share in the negotiationto show that it could not be concluded with anyonebut himself entered the lists to break offthe contract he made a larger offer with hisdaughter marjory than the earl of march hadproffered and secured by his own cupidity andfear of the douglas albany exerted his influencewith the timid monarch till he was prevailedupon to break the contract with the earl ofmarch and wed his son to marjory douglas awoman whom he could not love no apologywas offered to the earl of march excepting thatthe espousals betwixt the prince and elizabethof dunbar had not been approved by the statesof parliament and that till such ratificationthe contract was liable to be broken off theearl deeply resented the wrong done to himselfand his daughter and was generally understoodto study revenge which his great influence onthe english frontier was likely to place withinhis powerin the meantime the duke of rothsay incensedat the sacrifice of his hand and his inclinationsto this stateintrigue took his own modeof venting his displeasure by neglecting hiswife contemning his formidable and dangerousfatherinlaw and showing little respect to theauthority of the king himself and none whateverto the remonstrances of albany his unclewhom he looked upon as his confirmed enemyamid these internal dissensions of his familywhich extended themselves through his councilsand administration introducing everywhereathe baneful effects of uncertainty and disunionthe feeble monarch had for some time beensupported by the counsels of his queen arabellaa daughter of the noble house of drummondgifted with a depth of sagacity and firmnessof mind which exercised some restraintover the levities of a son who respected her andsustained on many occasions the wavering resolutionof her royal husband but after herdeath the imbecile sovereign resembled nothingso much as a vessel drifted from her anchorsand tossed about amidst contending currentsabstractedly considered robert might be saidto doat upon his son to entertain respect andawe for the character of his brother albany somuch more decisive than his own to fear thedouglas with a terror which was almost instinctiveand to suspect the constancy of thebold but fickle earl of march but his feelingstowards these various characters were so mixedand complicated that from time to time theyshowed entirely different from what they reallywere and according to the interest whichhad been last exerted over his flexible mindthe king would change from an indulgent toa strict and even cruel father from a confidingto a jealous brother or from a benignantand bountiful to a grasping and encroachingsovereign like the cameleon his feeble mindreflected the colour of that firmer characterupon which at the time he reposed for counseland assistance and when he disused theadvice of one of his family and employed thecounsel of another it was no unwonted thingto see a total change of measures equally disrespectableto the character of the king and dangerousto the safety of the stateit followed as a matter of course that theclergy of the catholic church acquired influenceover a man whose intentions were so excellentbut whose resolutions were so infirm robertwas haunted not only with a due sense of theerrors he had really committed but with thetormenting apprehensions of those peccadilloeswhich beset a superstitious and timid mind itis scarcely necessary therefore to add that thechurchmen of various descriptions had no smallinfluence over this easytempered prince thoughindeed theirs was at that period an influencefrom which few or none escaped however resoluteand firm of purpose in affairs of a temporalcharacter we now return from this long digressionwithout which what we have to relatecould not perhaps have been well understoodthe king had moved with ungraceful difficultyto the cushioned chair which under astate or canopy stood prepared for his accommodationand upon which he sank down with enjoymentlike an indolent man who had beenfor some time confined to a constrained positionwhen seated the gentle and venerablelooks of the good old man showed benevolencethe prior who now remained standing oppositeto the royal seat with an air of deep deferencewhich cloaked the natural haughtinessof his carriage was a man betwixt forty andfifty years of age but every one of whose hairsstill retained their natural dark colour acutefeatures and a penetrating look attested thetalents by which the venerable father had acquiredhis high station in the community overwhich he presided and we may add in thecouncils of the kingdom in whose service theywere often exercised the chief objects whichhis education and habits taught him to keep inview were the extension of the dominion andthe wealth of the church and the suppressionof heresy both of which he endeavoured to accomplishby all the means which his situationafforded him but he honoured his religion bythe sincerity of his own belief and by the moralitywhich guided his conduct in all ordinarysituations the faults of the prior anselmthough they led him into grievous error andeven cruelty were perhaps rather those of hisage and profession his virtues were his ownthese things done said the king andthe lands i have mentioned secured by mygift to this monastery you are of opinion fatherthat i stand as much in the good gracesof our holy mother church as to term myselfher dutiful son surely my liege said the prior wouldto god that all her children brought to the efficacioussacrament of confession as deep asense of their errors and as much will to makeamends for them but i speak these comfortingwords my liege not to robert king ofscotland but only to my humble and devoutpenitent robert stewart of carrickyou surprise me father answered theking i have little check on my consciencefor aught that i have done in my kingly officeseeing that i use therein less mine own opinionthan the advice of the most wise counsellorseven therein lieth the danger my liegereplied the prior the holy father recognisesin your grace in every thought wordand action an obedient vassal of the holychurch but there are perverse counsellorswho obey the instinct of their wicked heartswhile they abuse the goodnature and ductilityof their monarch and under colour of servinghis temporal interests take steps which are prejudicialto those that last to eternityking robert raised himself upright in hischair and assumed an air of authority whichthough it well became him he did not usuallydisplayprior anselm he said if you have discoveredanything in my conduct whether as aking or a private individual which may calldown such censures as your words intimate itis your duty to speak plainly and i commandyou to do somy liege you shall be obeyed answeredthe prior with an inclination of the bodythen raising himself up and assuming thedignity of his rank in the church he saidhear from me the words of our holy fatherthe pope the successor of st peter to whomhave descended the keys both to bind and tounloose wherefore o robert of scotlandhast thou not received into the see of st andrewsrobert of wardle whom the pontiffhath recommended to fill that see why dostthou make profession with thy lips of dutifulservice to the church when thy actions proclaimthe depravity and disobedience of thyinward soul obedience is better than sacrificessir prior said the monarch bearing himselfin a manner not unbecoming his loftyrank we may well dispense with answeringyou upon this subject being a matter whichconcerns us and the estates of our kingdombut does not affect our private consciencealas said the prior and whose consciencewill it concern at the last day whichof your belted lords or wealthy burgesses willthen step between their king and the penaltywhich he has incurred by following of theirsecular policy in matters ecclesiastical knowmighty king that were all the chivalry of thyrealm drawn up to shield thee from the redlevin bolt they would be consumed like scorchedparchment before the blaze of a furnacegood father prior said the king onwhose timorous conscience this kind of languageseldom failed to make an impressionyou surely argue over rigidly in this matterit was during my last indisposition while theearl of douglas held as lieutenantgeneralthe regal authority in scotland that the obstructionto the reception of the primate unhappilyarose do not therefore tax me withwhat happened when i was unable to conductthe affairs of the kingdom and compelled todelegate my power to anotherto your subject sire you have saidenough replied the prior but if the impedimentarose during the lieutenancy of theearl of douglas the legate of his holiness willdemand wherefore it has not been instantlyremoved when the king resumed in his royalhands the reins of authority the black douglascan do much more perhaps than a subjectshould have power to do in the kingdom of hissovereign but he cannot stand betwixt yourgrace and your own conscience or release youfrom the duties to the holy church which yoursituation as a king imposes upon youfather said robert somewhat impatiently you are over peremptory in this matterand ought at least to wait a reasonable seasonvol i ountil we have time to consider of some remedysuch disputes have happened repeatedly in thereigns of our predecessors and our royal andblessed ancestor saint david did not resignhis privileges as a monarch without making astand in their defence even though he was involvedin arguments with the holy father himselfand therein was that great and good kingneither holy nor saintly said the prior andtherefore was he given to be a rout and aspoil to his enemies when he raised his swordagainst the banners of st peter and st pauland st john of beverley in the war as it isstill called of the standard well was it forhim that like his namesake the son of jessehis sin was punished upon earth and not enteredagainst him at the long and dire day ofaccountingwell good prior well enough of thisfor the present the holy see shall godwilling have no reason to complain of me itake our lady to witness i would not for thecrown i wear take the burden of wrongingour mother church we have ever feared thatthe earl of douglas kept his eyes too muchfixed on the fame and the temporalities of thisfrail and passing life to feel altogether asheought the claims that refer to a futureworldit is but lately said the prior that hehath taken up forcible quarters in the monasteryof aberbrothock with his retinue of athousand followers and the abbot is compelledto furnish him with all he needs for horseand man which the earl calls exercising thehospitality which he hath a right to expect fromthe foundation to which his ancestors werecontributors certain it were better to returnto the douglas his lands than to submit to suchexaction which more resembles the masterfullicense of highland tigers and corners thanthe demeanour of a christian baronthe black douglass said the king witha sigh are a race which will not be saidnay but father prior i am myself it mayube an intruder of this kind for my sojourninghath been long among you and my retinuethough far fewer than the douglas's are neverthelessenough to cumber you for their dailymaintenance and though our order is to sendout purveyors to lessen your charge as muchas may be yet if there be inconvenience it werefitting we should remove in timenow our lady forbid said the priorwho if desirous of power had nothing meanlycovetous in his temper but was even magnificentin his generous kindness certainly the dominicanconvent can afford to her sovereign thehospitality which the house offers to everywanderer of whatever condition who will receiveit at the hands of the poor servants of ourpatron no my royal liege come with tentimes your present train they shall neither wanta grain of oats a pile of straw a morsel ofbread nor an ounce of food which our conventwill not supply them it is one thing to employthe revenues of the church which areso much larger than monks ought to need orwish for in the suitable and dutiful receptionof your royal majesty and another to have itwrenched from us by the hands of rude andviolent men whose love of rapine is only limitedby the extent of their powerit is well good prior said the king and now to turn our thoughts for an instantfrom state affairs can thy reverence inform ushow the good citizens of perth have beguntheir valentine's day gallantly and merrilyand peacefully i hopeki for gallantly my liege i know little ofsuch qualities for peacefully there were threeor four men two cruelly wounded came thismorning before daylight to ask the privilege ofgirth and sanctuary pursued by a hue and cryof citizens in their shirts with clubs bills lochaberaxes and twohanded swords crying killand slay each louder than another nay theywere not satisfied when our porter and watchtold them that those they pursued had takenrefuge in the galilee of the church but continuedfor some minutes clamouring and strikingupon the postern door demanding that themen who had offended should be delivered uptothem i was afraid their rude noise mighthave broken your majesty's rest and raisedsome surprisemy rest might have been broken said themonarch but that sounds of violence shouldhave occasioned surprise alas reverend fatherthere is in scotland only one place wherethe shriek of the victim and threats of theoppressor are not heard and that father is the gravethe prior stood in respectful silence sympathizingwith the feelings of a monarch whosetenderness of heart suited so ill with the conditionand manners of his peopleand what became of the fugitives askedrobert after a minute's pausesurely sire said the prior they weredismissed as they desired to be before daylight and after we had sent out to be assuredthat no ambush of their enemies watched themin the vicinity they went their way in peaceyou know nothing inquired the kingwho the men were or the cause of their takingrefuge with you the cause said the prior was the riotwith the townsmen hut how arising is notknown to us the custom of our house is to affordtwentyfour hours of uninterrupted refugein the sanctuary of st dominic without askingany question at the poor unfortunates who havesought relief there if they desire to remainfor a longer space the cause of their resortingto sanctuary must be put upon the register ofthe convent and praised be our holy saintmany persons escape the weight of the law bythis temporary protection whom did we knowthe character of their crimes we might havefound ourselves obliged to render up to theirpursuers and persecutorsas the prior spoke a dim idea occurred tothe monarch that the privilege of sanctuarythus peremptorily executed must prove a severeinterruption to the course of justice throughhis realm but he repelled the feeling as if ithad been a suggestion of satan and took carethat not a single word should escape to betrayto the churchman that such a profane thoughthad ever occupied his bosom on the contraryhe hasted to change the subject the sun he said moves slowly on theindex after the painful information you havegiven me i expected the lords of my councilere now to take order with the ravelled affairs ofthis unhappy riot evil was the fortune whichgave me rule over a people among whom itseems to me i am in my own person the onlyman who desires rest and tranquillitythe church always desires peace and tranquillityadded the prior not suffering even sogeneral a proposition to escape the poor king'soppressed mind without insisting on a savingclause for the church's honourwe meant nothing else said robertbut father prior you will allow that thechurch in quelling strife as is doubtless herpurpose resembles the busy housewife whoputs in motion the dust which she means tosweep awayto this remark the prior would have madesome reply but the door of the apartment wasopened and a gentleman usher announced theduke of albanyichapter ixif i know how to manage these affairsthus thrust disorderly upon my handsnever believe me richard iithe duke of albany was like his royal brothernamed robert the christian name of thelatter had been john until he was called to thethrone when the superstition of the times observedthat the name had been connected withmisfortune in the lives and reigns of john ofengland john of france and john baliol ofscotland it was therefore agreed that toelude the bad omen the new king should assumethe name of robert rendered dear toscotland by the recollections of robert brucewe mention this to account for the existenceof two brothers of the same christian name inone family which was not certainly an usualoccurrence more than at the present dayalbany also an aged man was not supposedto be much more disposed for warlikeenterprise than the king himself but if hehad not courage he had wisdom to conceal andcloak over his want of that quality which oncesuspected would have ruined all the planswhich his ambition had formed he had alsopride enough to supply in extremity the wantof real valour and command enough over hisnerves to conceal their agitation in other respectshe was experienced in the ways of courtscalm cool and crafty fixing upon the pointswhich he desired to attain while they were yetfar removed and never losing sight of themthough the winding paths in which he trodemight occasionally seem to point to a differentdirection in his person he resembled theking for he was noble and majestic both in statureand countenance but he had the advantageof his elder brother in being unencumberedwith any infirmity and in every respect lighterand more active his dress was rich and graveas became his age and rank and like his royalbrother he wore no arms of any kind a caseof small knives supplying at his girdle the placeusually occupied by a dagger in absence of aswordat the duke's entrance the prior after makingan obeisance respectfully withdrew to a recessin the apartment at some distance from theroyal seat in order to leave the conversation ofthe brothers uncontrolled by the presence of athird person it is necessary to mention that therecess was formed by a window placed in theinner front of the monastic buildings called thepalace from its being the frequent residenceof the kings of scotland but which was unlesson such occasions the residence of the prioror abbot the window was placed over theprincipal entrance to the royal apartments andcommanded a view of the internal quadrangleof the convent formed on the right hand bythe length of the magnificent church on theleft by a building containing the range of cellarswith the refectory chapterhouse andother conventual apartments rising above themfor such existed altogether independent of thespace occupied by king robert and his attendants while a fourth row of buildings showinga noble outward front to the rising sun consistedof a large hospital for the receptionof strangers and pilgrims and many subordinateoffices warehouses and places of accommodationfor the ample stores which suppliedthe magnificent hospitality of the dominicanfathers a lofty vaulted entrance ledthrough this eastern front into the quadrangleand was precisely opposite to the window atwhich prior anselm stood so that he could seeunderneath the dark arch and observe the lightwhich gleamed beneath it from the eastern andopen portal but owing to the height to whichhe was raised and the depth of the vaultedarchway his eye could but indistinctly reachthe opposite and external portal it is necessaryto notice these localities we return to the conversationbetween the princely relativesmy dear brother said the king raisingthe duke of albany as he stooped to kiss hishand my dear dear brother wherefore thisceremonial are we not both sons of the samestewart of scotland and of the same elizabethmore i have not forgot that it is so said albanyarising but i must not omit in thefamiliarity of the brother the respect that isdue to the kingoh true most true robin answered theking the throne is like a lofty and barrenrock upon which flower or shrub can nevertake root all kindly feelings all tender affectionsare denied to a monarch a king mustnot fold a brother to his heart he dare notgive way to fondness for a son such in some respects is the doom ofgreatness sire answered albany but heavenwho removed to some distance from yourmajesty's sphere the members of your own familyhas given you a whole people to be yourchildrenalas robert answered the monarchyour heart is better framed for the duties ofa sovereign than mine i see from the height atwhich fate has placed me that multitude whomyou call my children i love them i wish themwell but they are many and they are distantfrom me alas even the meanest of them hassome beloved being whom he can clasp to hisheart and upon whom he can lavish the fondnessof a father but all that a king can giveto a people is a smile such as the sun bestowson the snowy peaks of the grampian mountainsas distant and as ineffectual alas robin our father used to caress us and if he chid usit was with a tone of kindness yet he was amonarch as well as i and wherefore should noti be permitted like him to reclaim my poorprodigal by affection as well as severity had affection never been tried my liegereplied albany in the tone of one who deliverssentiments which he grieves to utter meansof gentleness ought assuredly to be first madeuse of your grace is best judge whether theyhave been long enough persevered in and whetherthose of discouragement and restraint maynot prove a more effectual corrective it is exclusivelyin your royal power to take whatmeasures with the duke of rothsay you thinkwill be most available to his ultimate benefitand that of the kingdomthis is unkind brother said the king m you indicate the painful path which you wouldhave me pursue yet you offer

poniard he hadleft in the anteroom the page of honour whocarried his sword the earl was a wellbuilthandsome man faircomplexioned with a considerableprofusion of lightcoloured hair andbright blue eyes which gleamed like those of afalcon he exhibited in his countenance otherwisepleasing the marks of a hasty and irritabletemper which his situation as a high andpowerful feudal lord had given him but toomany opportunities of indulgingi am glad to see you my lord of marchsaid the king with a gracious inclination of hisperson k you have been long absent from ourcouncilsm my liege answered march with a deepreverence to the king and a haughty and formalinclination to the duke of albany if ihave been absent from your grace's councilsit is because my place has been supplied by moreacceptable and i doubt not abler counsellorsand now i come but to say to your highnessthat the news from the english frontier makeit necessary that i should return without delayto my own estates your grace has your wiseand politic brother my lord of albany withwhom to consult and the mighty and warlikeearl of douglas to carry your councils into effecti am of no use save in my own country and thither with your highness's permissioni am purposed instantly to return to attend mycharge as warden of the eastern marches you will not deal so unkindly with uscousin replied the gentle monarch hereare evil tidings on the wind these unhappyhighland clans are again breaking into generalcommotion and the tranquillity even of ourown court requires the best of our council toadvise and the bravest of our barons to executewhat may be resolved upon the descendantof thomas randolph will not surelyabandon the grandson of robert bruce at sucha period as this i leave with him the descendant of the farfamedjames of douglas answered marchit is his lordship's boast that he never putsfoot in stirrup but a thousand horse mount withhim as his daily lifeguard and i believe themonks of aberbrothock will swear to the factsurely with all the douglas's chivalry theyare fitter to restrain a disorderly swarm ofhighland kerne than i can be to withstand thearchery of england and power of henry hotspur and then here is his grace of albanyso jealous in his care of your highness's personthat he calls your brandanes to take arms whena dutiful subject like myself approaches thecourt with a poor halfscore of horse the retinueof the meanest of the petty barons who owna tower and a thousand acres of barren heathwhen such precautions are taken where thereis not the slightest chance of peril since i trustnone was to be apprehended from me yourroyal person will surely be suitably guarded inreal dangermy lord of march said the duke of albany the meanest of the barons of whom youspeak put their followers in arms even whenthey receive their dearest and nearest friendswithin the iron gate of their castle and if itplease our lady i will not care less for theking's person than they do for their own thebrandanes are the king's immediate retainersand household servants and an hundred of themis but a small guard round his grace whenyourself my lord as well as the earl of douglasoften ride with ten times the numbermy lord duke replied march whenthe service of the king requires it i can ridewith ten times as many horse as your grace hasnamed but i have never done so either traitorouslyto entrap the king nor boastfully tooverawe other noblesbrother robert said the king ever anxiousto be a peacemaker you do wrongeven to intimate a suspicion of my lord ofmarch and you cousin of march misconstruemy brother's caution but hark todivert this angry parley i hear no unpleasingtouch of minstrelsy you know the gayscience my lord of march and love it well step to yonder window beside the holy priorat whom we make no question touching secularpleasures and you will tell us if the music andlay be worth listening to the notes are offrance i think my brother of albany's judgmentis not worth a cockleshell in such matters so you cousin must report your opinionwhether the poor gleemaiden deserves recompenseour son and the douglas will presentlybe here and then when our council is assembledwe will treat of graver matterswith something like a smile on his proudbrow march withdrew into the recess of thewindow and stood there in silence beside theprior like one who while he obeyed the king'scommand saw through and despised the timidprecaution which it implied as an attempt toprevent the dispute betwixt albany and himselfthe tune which was played upon a violwas gay and sprightly in the commencementwith a touch of the wildness of the troubadourmusic but as it proceeded the falteringtones of the instrument and of the female voicewhich accompanied it became plaintive and interrupteda if choked by the painful feelingsof the minstrelthe offended earl whatever might be hisjudgment in such matters on which the kinghad complimented him paid it may be supposedlittle attention to the music of the femaleminstrel his proud heart was struggling betweenthe allegiance he owed his sovereign aswell as the love he still found lurking in hisbosom for the person of his wellnatured kingand a desire of vengeance arising out of hisdisappointed ambition and the disgrace doneto him by the substitution of marjory douglasto be bride of the heirapparent instead of hisbetrothed daughter march had the vices andvirtues of a hasty and uncertain character andeven now when he came to bid the king adieuwith the purpose of renouncing his allegiance assoon as he reached his own feudal territories hefelt unwilling and almost unable to resolveupon a step so criminal and so full of peril itwas with such dangerous cogitations that hewas occupied during the beginning of the gleemaiden'slay but objects which called his attentionpowerfully as the songstress proceededaffected the current of his thoughts and rivetedthem on what was passing in the courtyardof the monastery the song was in the provencaldialect well understood as the language ofpoetry in all the courts of europe and particularlyin scotland it was more simply turnedhowever than was the general

common gleemaiden even in the presence ofher fatherthe king had hitherto listened to the earl'sargument with the bewildered feelings of atimid horseman borne away by an impetuoussteed whose course he can neither arrest nordirect but the last words awakened in his recollectionthe sense of his son's immediate dangeroh ay most true my son the douglasoh my dear cousin prevent blood and allshall be as you will hark there is a tumult that was the clash of armsby my coronet by my knightly faith itis true said the earl looking from the windowupon the inner square of the convent nowfilled with armed men and brandished weaponsand resounding with the clash of armourthe deepvaulted entrance was crowded withwarriors at its farthest extremity and blowsseemed to be in the act of being exchangedbetwixt some who were endeavouring to shutthe gate and others who contended to press ini will go instantly said the earl of marchandsoon quell this sudden broil humblyvol i si pray your majesty to think on what i havehad the boldness to proposei will i will fair cousin said the kingscarce knowing to what he pledged himself do but prevent tumult and bloodshed chapter xwe must here trace a little more correctlythe events which had been indistinctly seenfrom the window of the royal apartments andyet more indistinctly reported by those whowitnessed them the gleemaiden already mentionedhad planted herself where a rise of twolarge broad steps giving access to the maingateway of the royal apartments gained heran advantage of a foot and a half in heightover those in the court of whom she hoped toform an audience she wore the dress of hercalling which was more gaudy than rich andshowed the person more than did the garb ofother females she had laid aside an uppermantle and a small basket which contained herslender stock of necessaries and a little frenchspaniel dog sat beside them as their protectoran azureblue jacket embroidered with silverand sitting close to the person was open infront and showed several waistcoats of differ en tcoloured silks calculated to set off the symmetryof the shoulders and bosom and remainingopen at the throat a small silver chain wornaround her neck involved itself amongst thesebrilliantcoloured waistcoats and was againproduced from them to display a medal of thesame metal which intimated in the name ofsome court or guild of minstrels the degreeshe had taken in the gay or joyous sciencea small scrip suspended over her shoulders bya blue silk ribband hung on her left sideher sunny complexion snowwhite teethbrilliant black eyes and raven locks markedher country lying far in the south of franceand the arch smile and dimpled chin borethe same character her luxuriant locks twistedaround a small gold bodkin were keptin their position by a net of silk and goldshort petticoats deeplaced with silver to correspondwith the jacket red stockings whichwere visible to near the calf of the leg andbuskins of spanish leather completed her adjustmentwhich though far from new had beensaved as an untarnished holiday suit which muchcare had kept in good order she seemed abouttwentyfive years old but perhaps fatigue andwandering had anticipated the touch of timein obliterating the freshness of early youthwe have said the gleemaiden's manner waslively and we may add that her smile and reparteewere ready but her gaiety was assumedas a quality essentially necessary to hertrade of which it was one of the miseries thatthe professors were obliged frequently to coveran aching heart with a compelled smile thisseemed to be the case with louise who whethershe was actually the heroine of her ownsong or whatever other cause she might havefor sadness showed at times a strain of deepmelancholy thought which interfered with andcontrolled the natural flow of lively spiritswhich the practice of the joyous science especiallyrequired she lacked also even in hergayest sallies the decided boldness and effronteryof her sisterhood who were seldom at aloss to retort a saucy jest or turn the laughagainst any who interrupted or interfered with themit may be here remarked that it was impossiblethat this class of women very numerousin that age could bear a character generallyrespectable they were however protectedby the manners of the time and such were theimmunities they possessed by the rights of chivalrythat nothing was more rare than to hearof such errant damsels sustaining injury orwrong and they passed and repassed safelywhere armed travellers would probably have encountereda bloody opposition but thoughlicensed and protected in honour of their tunefulart the wandering minstrels male or femalelike similar ministers to the public amusementthe itinerant musicians for instanceand strolling comedians of our own day led alife too irregular and precarious to be accounteda creditable part of society indeed amongthe stricter catholics the profession was consideredas unlawfulsuch was the damsel who with viol inhand and stationed on the slight elevation wehave mentioned stepped forward to the bystandersand announced herself as a mistressof the gay science duly qualified by a brief froma court of love and music held at aix inprovence under the countenance of the flowerof chivalry the gallant count aimer who nowprayed that the cavaliers of merry scotland whowere known over the wide world for bravery andcourtesy would permit a poor stranger to trywhether she could afford them any amusementby her art the love of song was like the loveof fight a common passion of the age whichall at least affected whether they actually possessedit or no therefore the acquiescence inlouise's proposal was universal at the sametime an aged darkbrowed monk who wasamong the bysanders thought it necessary toremind the gleemaiden that since she was toleratedwithin these precincts which was anunusual grace he trusted nothing would be sunjror said inconsistent with the holy character ofthe placethe gleemaiden bent her head low shookher sable locks and crossed herself reverentiallyas if she disclaimed the possibility of such atransgression and then began the song of poorlouise which we gave at length in the lastchapterjust as she commenced she was stopped bya cry for room room place for the dukeof rothsay nay hurry no man on my score said agallant young cavalier who entered on a noblearabian horse which he managed with exquisitegrace though by such slight handling of thereins such imperceptible pressure of the limbsand sway of the body that to any eye save thatof an experienced horseman the animal seemedto be putting forth his paces for his own amusementand thus gracefully bearing forward arider who was too indolent to give himself anytrouble about the matterthe prince's apparel which was very richwas put on with slovenly carelessness hisform though his stature was low and hislimbs extremely slight was elegant in the extremeand his features no less handsome

preceding evening while hischeek was inflamed with unnatural red as ifeither the effect of the bacchanalian orgies hadnot passed away from the constitution or amorning draught had been resorted to in

which feeling predominated morethan in the affected and contemptuous gallantryof his first address to the glee maidenat this moment as he turned to ask an attendantfor his purse the prince encounteredthe stern and piercing look of a tall black manseated on a powerful irongrey horse who hadentered with attendants while the duke ofrothsay was engaged with louise and now remainedstupefied and almost turned to stone byhis surprise and anger at this unseemly spectacleeven one who had never seen the blackdouglas must have known him by his swartcomplexion his gigantic frame his buffcoat

at the outward gate ofthe monastery already noticed and men bothon horseback and on foot began to rush headlongin not actually fighting with each otherbut certainly in no peaceable mannerthe contending parties seemingly were partizansof douglas known by the cognizanceof the bloody heart and citizens of the townof perth it appeared they had been skirmishingin earnest when without the gates
