nayit would be no ways improbable that he shouldpenetrate to this very room what bars had yetbeii found sufficient to repel him and who couldpretend to calculate the hour of his visit thisnight even might be the time which he would selectthinking thus the landgrave was suddenly awareof a whisky figure entering the room by door atthe lower end the room had the length and generalproportions of a

notbut feel relieved from a burden of aimons tremorsts klobthhlmwhen he saw the masque suddenly turn towards adoor which opened about half way up the room andlead into a picturegiiuery at right angles with theroom in which they both wereinto the picturegallery the masque passed at thesame solent pace without apparently looking atthe landgrave this movement seemed to argueeither that he purposely declined an interview withthe prince and that might aise fear or that hehad not been aware of his presence either suppositionas implying something of human infirmityseemed incompatible with supernatural facultiespartly upon this consideration and partly perhapsbecause he suddenly recollected that the road takenby the masque would lead him directly past theapartments of the old seneschal

leisurely the passagewas dimly lighted every image floated in a cloudyobscurity and upon reaching the curve it seemedto the landgrave that the masque was just on thepoint of entering the seneschal's

worenearly expired the morning of the twentiethhad arrivedthere were two interpretations of this summonsby many it was believed that the tribunal contemplatedwas that of the emperor and that by somemysterious plot which could not be more difficultof execution than others which had actuallybeen accomplished by the masque on this day thelandgrave would be carried off to vienna othersagain understanding by the tribunal in the samesense the imperial chamber of criminal justice believedit possible to fulfil the summons in some wayless liable to delay or uncertainty than by a longklostefiheim journey to vienna through a country beset withenemies but a third party differing from boththe others understood by the tribunal where innocencewas the only shield the judgment seat ofheaven and believed that on this day justice wouldbe executed on the landgrave for crimes knownand unknown by a pnbhc and memorable deathunder any interpretation however nobody amongstthe citizens could venture peremptorily to deny afterthe issue of the manned ball and of so many otherpublic denunciations that the masque would keephis word to the letterit followed of necessity that every body was onthe tiptoe of suspense and that the interest hangingupon the issue of this night's events swallowedup all other anxieties of whatsoever nature eventhe battle which was now daily expected betweenthe imperial and swedish armies ceased to occupythe hearts and conversation of the citizens domesticand public concerns alike gave way to the comingcatastrophe so solemnly denounced by the masquethe landgrave alone maintained a gloomy reserveand the expression of a haughty disdain hehad resolved to meet the summons with the klosterheimlies expression of defiance by fixing this eveningfor a second masque ball upon a greater scale thanthe first in doing this he acted advisedly and withthe counsel of his swedish allies they representedto him that the issue of the approaching battle nightbe relied upon as pretty neaiiy certain all the indicationswere indeed generally thought to promise adecisive turn in their favour but in the worst caseno defeat of the swedish army in this war had everbeen complete that the bulk of the retreatingarmy if the swedes should be obliged to retreatwould take the road to klosterheim and would furnishto himself a garrison capable of holding thecity for many months to come and thai would notfill to bring many fresh chances to all of themwhilst to his new and cordial allies this course wouldoffer a secure retreat from pursuing enemies and asatisfactory proof of his own fidelity this even inthe worst case whereas in the better and more probableone of a victory to the swedes to maintain thecity but for a day or two longer
