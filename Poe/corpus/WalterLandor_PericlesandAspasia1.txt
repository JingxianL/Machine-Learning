learning by heart the two first yearsof thucydides and in repeating as he walksalong the sterling and strenuous orations theycontain it is easy to throw pieces of historyinto letters many have done it but there isno species of composition so remote from verisimilitudewho can imagine to himself avil advertisementcouple of correspondents sitting down for sucha purpose and never turning their eyes

not interfere i will now tell you all no time was to belost so i hastened on shore in the dress of anathenian boy who came over with his motherfrom lemnos in the giddiness of youth heforgot to tell me that not being yet eighteenyears old he could not be admitted and leftme on the steps my heart sank within me somany young men stared and whispered yetpericles and aspasianever was stranger treated with more civilitycrowded as the theatre was for the tragedyhad begun every one made room for mewhen they were seated and i too i lookedtowards the stage and behold there lay beforeme but afar off

anywoman or any man so little vain as you areformerly you were rather so about your poetry but now you really write it well you have overcomethis weakness nay you doubt whetheryour best verses are tolerable you have toldme this several times and you always say whatyou think unless when any one might be hurtor displeased i am glad the observation comesacross me for i must warn you upon ittake care then aspasia do not leave offentirely all dissimulation it is as feminine avirtue and as necessary to a woman as religionif you are without it you will have agrace the less and what you could

and followedus close behindi have since been informed that pericles whosate below us on the first seat was the only manpericles and aspasia who did not rise no matter why should he why did the rest but it was very kind in himto send his cousin i mean it was very kindfor so proud a manepimedea wept over me when i entered herhouse and burned incense before the gods andled me into my chamberi have a great deal to say to you my dearaspasia but you must go to sleep your bathshall be ready at noon but be sure you sleeptill then said shei did indeed sleep and will you believe it instantly and soundly never was bath morerefreshing never was reproof more gentle thanepimedea'si found her at my pillow when i awoke andshe led me to the marble conchdear child said she when i had stept inyou do not know our customs you shouldhave come at once to my house you nevershould have worn men's clothes indeed you pericles and aspasiashould not have gone to the theatre at allbut being there and moreover in men's habilimentsyou should have taken care not to havefainted as they say you did my husbandthessaly would never hear of fainting heused to tell me it was a bad example but hefainted at last poor man and i minded hisadmonition why what a lovely child you aregrown my little aspasia is the bath too hot aspasia can it be why you are no childat all i really do believe that this idle discourse ofepimedea which will tire you perhaps was theonly one that would not have wearied out myspirits it neither made me think nor answerwhat a privilege what a blessing how seldomto be enjoyed in our conferences with the sillyah do not let me wrong the kindheartedepimedea those are not silly who have foundthe way to our hearts and far other names dothey deserve who open to us theirspericles and aspasia aspasia to cleonethe boy about whom i wrote to you in myletter of yesterday is called alcibiades healcibiades had no right to be at the theatre buthe might have been sent for on the occasion or havetaken the liberty to come in hearing a bustle forthere was nobody in athens whom he feared or caredfor either in his childhood or after thucydides callsalcibiades a youth in the twelfth year of the peloponnesianwar nine years after the death of periclesalcibiades was on the mother's side grandson ofmiracles whose granddaughter isidore marriedcimon her father euryptolemus was cousingermainof pericles it is impossible that men so prudentand welltempered as pericles and cimon thetwo most perfect models of a gentleman that everexisted upon earth could have been enemies theyheaded two opposite parties and conscientiously onthis principle thessaly son of cimon was the accuserof his cousin alcibiadesthe leaders in athens looked beyond and over their pericles and aspasialisps and blushes at it his cousin periclesyou may have heard enjoys the greatest powerand reputation both as an orator and a generalof any man in athens early this morning thebeautiful child came to visit me and told me thatwhen his cousin had finished his studies whichhe usually had done about three hours aftersunrise he would desire him to come alsoi replied by no means do it my beautifuland brave protector surely on consideringthe matter you will think you are taking toogreat a liberty with a person so distinguishedi take no liberties with any other said hewhen i expressed in my countenance a littlesurprise at his impetuosity he came forwardand kissed my brow then said he moresubmissively pardon my rudeness i likevery well to be told what to do by those whoare fond of me but never to be told what notown families dangerous precedent laudably avoidedby popular statesmen sincepericles and aspasia to do and the more fond they are of me theless i like it because when they tell me whatto do they give me an opportunity of pleasingthem but when they tell me what not to do it isa sign that i have displeased or am likely to displeasethem besides i believe there are someother reasons but they have quite escaped meit is time i should return said he or ishall forget all about the hour of his studiesi mean pericles and mine tooi would not let him go however but inquiredwho were his teachers and repeated tohim many things from sappho and alcaeusand pindar and simonides he was amazedand told me he preferred them to fate and necessitypython and pythonissai could now have kissed him in my turn buthe drew back thinking no doubt that i wastreating him like a child that a kiss is nevergiven but as the price of pardon and that ihad pardoned him before for his captiousness pericles and aspasiacleone to aspasiaaspasia i foresee that henceforward you willadmire the tragedy of prometheus more thanever but do not tell any one excepting sofond a friend as cleon that you prefer theauthor to homer i agree with you that theconception of such a drama is in itself a stupendouseffort of genius that the execution isequal to the conception that the character ofprometheus is more heroick than any in heroickpoetry and that no production of the sameextent is so magnificent and so exalted butthe iliad is not a region it is a continent andyou might as well compare this prodigy to it asthe cataract of the nile to the ocean in theone we are overpowered by the compressionand burst of the element in the other we arepericles and aspasia carried over an immensity of space boundingthe earth not bounded by her and having nothingabove but the heavenslet us enjoy whenever we have an opportunitythe delight of admiration and performthe duties of reverence may others hatewhat is admirable we will hate likewise omy aspasia when we can do no better i amunable to foretell the time when this shallhappen it lies i think beyond the calculationsof setoni am happy to understand that the athenianshave such a philosopher among them hithertowe have been inclined to suppose that philosophyat athens is partly an intricate tissue ofsubtile questions and illusory theories knottedwith syllogisms and partly an indigested massof unexamined assertions and conflicting dogmasthe loans are more silent contemplativeand recluse knowing that nature pericles and aspasiawill not deliver her oracles in the crowd norby sound of trumpet they open their breaststo her in solitude with the simplicity ofchildren and look earnestly in her face for areply meton and democritus and anaxagorasmay perhaps lay their hands upon theleaping of your tettinxes and moderate theirchirping but i apprehend that the genius ofthe people will always repose upon the windskinsof the sophists comedy might be theircorrector but comedy seems to think she hastwo offices to perform from one side of thestage to explode absurdity and from the otherto introduce indecency she might under wiseregulations and these she should impose uponherself render more service to a state thanphilosophy could in whatsoever other characterand i wonder that aristophanes sostrong in the poetical faculty and unrivalled incritical acuteness should not perceive that apericles and aspasia dominion is within his reach which is within thereach of no mortal beside a dominion wherebyhe may reform the manners dictate the pursuitsand regulate the affections of his countrymenperhaps he never could have done it soeffectually had he been better and begun otherwise but having however unworthy might havebeen the means and methods seized upon theirhumours they now are as pliable to him aswaxen images to tressilian witches he keepsthem before the fire he has kindled and he hasonly to sing the right songbeware my dear aspasia never to offendhim he holds more terrors at his commandthan eschylus the tragic poet rolls thethunder that frightens the comic wields thelightning that kills aristophanes has thepower of tossing you among the populace of athousand cities for a thousand years pericles and aspasiaa great poet is more powerful than sesostrisand a wicked one more formidable than palaisaspasia to cleoneepimedea has been with me in my chambershe asked me whether the women of ionia hadleft off wearing earrings i answered that i believedthey always had worn them and that theywere introduced by the persians who had receivedthem from nations more remoteand do you think yourself too young saidshe for such an ornament producing atthe same instant a massy pair inlaid with thelargest emeralds alas alas said sheyour mother neglected you strangely therepericles and aspasia is no hole in the ear right or left we canmend that however i know a woman who willbring us the prettiest little pan of charcoal withthe prettiest little steel rod in it and beforeyou can cry out one ear lets light throughthese are yours said she and so shall everythingbe house garden quails leveretgenerous epimedea said i do not saythings that pain me i will accept a part of thepresent i will wear these beautiful emeralds onone arm thinking of nailing them in myears you resolved to make me steady but i amunwilling they should become dependencies ofatticaall our young women wear them thegoddesses toothe goddesses are in the right said i their ears are marble but i do not believeany one of them would tell us that women were pericles and aspasiamade to be the settings of pearls and emeraldsi had taken one and was about to kiss herwhen she said do not leave me an odd earring put the other in the hairepimedea said i i have made a vowneverto wear on the head any thing but onesingle flower one single wheatear green oryellow and ivy or vineleaves the number ofthese are not mentioned in the vowrash child said epimedea shaking herhead i never made but two vows one w aswhen i took a husbandand the other epimedea no matter said she it might be forwhat i know never to do the like againpericles and aspasia aspasia to cleonepericles has visited me after many graveand gentle inquiries often suspended all relatingto my health and after praises of miletusand pity for my friends left behind hetold me that when he was quite assured of myperfect recovery from the fatigues of the voyagehe hoped i would allow him to collect from meatmy leisurehours the information he wantedon the literature of ionia simplehearted man in praising the authors of our country heshowed me that he knew them perfectly fromfirst to last and now indeed his energy wasdisplayed i thought he had none at all withhow sonorous and modulated a voice did herepeat fire more poetical passages of our eldervol i c pericles and aspasiahistorians and how his whole soul did leanupon herodotus happily

civilized are glaucus and sarpedonthan any of the grecians he was calledupon to celebrate priam paris hectorwhat polished men civilisation has nevermade a step in advance and never will onthose countries she had gone so far in the daysof homer he keeps helen pretty rigorously outof sight but he opens his heart to the virtues ofandromache what a barbarian is the sonof a goddess minerva must seize him by thehair to avert the murder of his leader but atthe eloquence of the phrygian king the stormof the intractable homicide bursts in tears and eschylus said i but could not conpericlesand aspasia tine blushes rose into my cheek and painedme at the recollection of my weaknesshe has left us said pericles who perceivedit but pretended not i am grievedthat my prayers were inadequate to detain himbut what prayers or what expostulations caninfluence the lofty mind labouring and heavingunder injustice and indignity eschylus knewhe merited both by his genius and his servicesthe gratitude and admiration of the athenianshe saw others preferred before him and hoistedsail at the rumour of his departure such wasthe consternation as if the shield of minerva inthe parthenon had

wouldhave my smile out behind the door the versei quoted you may be sure is much admiredby the learned and no less by the brave andworthy men whom he celebrates for charioteershipand other such extremities but we of oldmiletus have been always taught that wordsshould be subordinate to ideas and we neverplace the pedestal on the head of the statuenow do not tell any body that i have spokena single word in dispraise of pindar men arenot too apt to admire what is admirable in theirsuperiors but on the contrary are very apt todetract from them and to seize on any thing pericles and aspasiawhich may tend to lower them pindar wouldnot have written so exquisitely if no fault hadever been found with him he would havewandered on among such inquiries as those hebegan in shall i sing

lips he ought not to asklike a poor fellow in the street good people what song will you have this however wasnot the fault for which he was blamed by corinnain our censures we are less apt toconsider the benefit we may confer than theingenuity we can displayshe said pindar you have brought a sackof corn to sow a perch of land and insteadof sprinkling it about you have emptied thesack at the first steppericles and aspasia enough this reproof formed his characterit directed his beat it singled his aimit concentrated his forces it was not bythe precepts of corinna it was not by herexample it was by one witticism of a wiseand lovely woman that he far excels allother poets in disdain of triviality and choiceof topics he is sometimes very tedious tousin his long stories of families but we maybesure he was not equally so to those whowere concerned in the genealogy we areamused at his cleverness in saving the shoulderof pelops from the devouring jaw of a hungrygod no doubt he mends the

ibelieve he is the first that ever travelled withno other intention than to see the cities andknow the manners of barbarians he representsthe soil as extremely fertile in its natureand equally well cultivated and the inhabitantsas warlike hospitable and courteous all thisis credible enough and perhaps as generallyknown as might be expected of regions so remoteand perilous but ly sides will appearto you to have assumed a little more than thefair privileges of a traveller in relating that thepeople have so imperfect a sense of religion asto bury the dead in the temples of the godsand the priests so avaricious and shameless asto claim money for the permission of this impietyhe told us furthermore that he hadseen a magnificent temple built on somewhat of pericles and aspasiaa grecian model in the interior of which thereare many flat marbles fastened with iron crampsagainst the walls and serving for monumentscontinuing his discourse he assured us thatthese monuments although none are ancientare of all forms and dimensions as if the thracianwere resolved to waste and abolish thesymmetry they had adopted and that they areinscribed in an obsolete language so that thepeople whom

to pass under on their roadinto the city as if a road on such an occasionought not rather to be widened than narrowed if you will not credit this of a barbarian whois reported to be an intelligent and prudentman in other things you will exclaim i fearagainst the exaggeration of lysicles and mynians thucydides says that to coast his kingdomrequired four days and four nights for the swiftestvessel sailing before the wind and that by land anexpeditious walker would hardly cross it in thirteendays stances the son of teres ravaged all macedoniain the reign of perdiccas pericles and

inscriptions commemoratevotive offerings in the language of the priestswhatever it may be so far is clear regardingthe arch lysicles saw them removing itand fancied they were building it this mistakeis really ludicrous the column you musthave perceived at once was erected not to displaythe victor but to expose the vanquisheda blunder very easy for an idle traveller tocommit few of the thracian i conceiveeven in the interior are so utterly ignorant ofgrecian arts as to raise a statue at such aheight above the ground that the vision shall pericles and aspasianot comprehend all the

that persons like you andpericles see little of these sharpers who platricks upon words it is amusing to observehow they do it once or twice as there aresome flowers which you should smell but slightlyto extract all that is pleasant in them andwhich if you do otherwise emit what is unpleasantor noxious so there are some menwith whom a slight acquaintance is quite sufficientto draw out all

at a time andabout the other in the triad too let me havethe choiceaspasia to pericleswe must talk over again the subject of yourletter no not talk but write about iti think pericles you who are so sincere withme are never quite sincere with others youhave contracted this bad habitude from yourcustom of addressing the people but amongg pericles and aspasiafriends and philosophers would it not be betterto speak exactly as we think whether ingeniouslyor not ingenious things i am afraidare never perfectly true however i would notexclude them the difference being very widebetween perfect truth

but it produced a suddenand powerful effect on alcibiades you willpericles and aspasia collect the whole from a summary of our conversationso very true said he is the remark ofanaxagoras that it was worth my while to controvertit did you not observe the attentionpaid to it by young and old i was unwillingthat the graver part of the company shouldargue tomorrow with alcibiades on the natureof love as they are apt to do and should persuadehim that he would be the better for iton this consideration i said while you wereoccupied o anaxagoras if we of this householdknew not how religious a man you are yourdiscourse would in some degree lead us to countenancethe suspicions of your enemies religionis never too little for us it satisfies all thedesires of the soul love is but an atom of

i wouldventure to take the cestus from venus distinguishingher merely by her own peculiar beautybut in the representations of the more awfulpowers who are to be venerated and worshippedas the patrons

cleoneafter i had written to you we renewed ourconversation on the same subject i inquiredof pericles whether he thought the appellationof golden was applied to venus for her preciousgifts or for some other reason his answerwassmall statues of venus are more numerousthan of any other deity and the first that weregilt in greece i believe were hers she isworshipped you know not only as the goddesspericles and aspasia of beauty but likewise as the goddess of fortunein the former capacity we are her rapturousadorers for five years perhaps in thelatter we persevere for life many carry herimage with them on their journeys and there isscarcely a house in any part of greece whereinit is not a principal ornamenti remarked to him that apollo from thecolour of his hair and the radiance

poetry is lifeitself and every thing around it and above itbut let us turn back again to the positionwe set out from and offer due reverence to thetruest diviners of the gods phidias in tendays is capable of producing what would outliveten thousand years if man were not resolved tobe the subverter of mans glory the godsthemselves will vanish away before theirimageso cleon this is painful to

aspasiautility of her imagination and the velocity of herpursuits do not permit her to settle fixedly onthe object of it how could i have ever lovedyou so if i believed the gods would disapproveof my attachment as they certainly would ifyou underrated their power and goodness they take especial care both to punish the unbelieverand to strike with awe the witnesses ofunbelief i accompanied my father not longsince to the temple of apollo and when wehad performed the usual rites of our devotionthere came up to us a young man of somewhatpleasing aspect with whose family ours wasanciently on terms of intimacy after my fatherhad made the customary inquiries he conversedwith us about his travels he had just leftephesus and said he had spent the morning in acomparison between diana's temple and apollo'she told us that they are similar in design butthat the ephesian goddess is an ugly lump ofpericles and aspasia darkcoloured stone while our apollo is ofsuch transcendent beauty that on first beholdinghim he wondered any other god had aworshipper my father was transported withjoy at such a declarationgive up the others said he worshiphere and rely on prosperitywere i myself to select answered heany deity in preference to the rest it shouldnot be an irascible or vindictive or unjustonesurely not cried my father it shouldbe apollo and our apollo what has dianadone for any man or any woman i speaksubmissively with all reverence i do notquestionthe young man answered i will forbear tosay a word about diana having been educatedin great fear of her but surely the treatment pericles and aspasiaof marsyas by apollo was bordering on severitynot a whit cried my father if understoodrightlyhis assent to the request of phaeton continuedthe young man knowing as he didthe consequence seems a little deficient in thatforesight which belongs peculiarly to the god ofprophecymy father left me abruptly ran to the fontand sprinkled first himself then me lastly theguest with lustral waterwe mortals continued he gravely shouldnot presume to argue on the gods after our owninferior nature and limited capacities whatappears to have been cruel might have beenmost kindly providentthe reasoning is conclusive said the youth you have caught by the hand a benighted andpericles and aspasia wandering dreamer and led him from the brinkof a precipice i see nothing left now on theroadside but the skin of marsyas and it wouldbe folly to start or flinch at itmy father had a slight suspicion of his sincerityand did not invite him to the house hehas attempted to come more than once evidentlywith an earnest desire to explore thetruth several days together he has been seenon the very spot where he made the confessionto my father in deep thought and as we hopeunder the influence of the deityi forgot to tell you that this young person isphrases son of portio the canaspasia to cleoneif ever there was a youth whose devotion wasardent and whose face i venture to say pericles and

themtogether at table but anaxagoras would notbreak through his custom nothing of philosophyour repast would have been even lesstalkative than usual had not anaxagoras askedour guest whether the earlier milesian authorspoets or historians had mentioned homeri find not a word about him in any one ofthem replied he although we have theworks of cadmus and phocyhdes the formerno admirable historian the latter an indifferentpoet but not the less likely to mention himand they are supposed to have lived withinpericles and aspasia three centuries of his age permit my firstquestion to you in my search after truth to bethis whether his age were not much earlier this is not the only question said anaxagoras on which you will hear from me theconfession of my utter ignorance i am interestedin every thing that relates to the operationsof the human mind and pericles has inhis possession every author whose works havebeen transcribed the number will appearquite incredible to you there cannot be fewerthan two hundred i find poetry to which isattributed an earlier date than to homer's butstupidity and barbarism are no convincingproofs i find cretan ionian laconia andboeotian written certainly more than three centuriesago the language is not copious is notfluent is not refined pericles says it is all ofit inharmonious of this i cannot judge hecan provides and minerals wrote no better pericles and aspasiaverses than the servantgirls sing upon our staircasesarchilochus and alcman who lived acentury earlier composed much grander butwhere there is at once ferocity and

perfection the muse of lesbos as sheis called and alcaeus invented each a novelspecies of strophe aspasia prefers the poetryof sappho and the metre of alcaeus whichhowever i think she informs us is less adaptedto her subjects than her own isit appears to me said i that every onewho felt strong in poetry was ambitious of beingan inventor in its measures archilochus thelast of any note had invented the iambictrue o aspasia said pericles butnot exactly in the sense usually received hepericles and aspasia did not invent as many suppose the sectarianiambic which is coeval almost with the languageitself and many of which creep into theclosest prose composition but he was the firstwho subjoined a shorter to it the barb to thedart so fatal to globule and lycambeshis first said i is like the trot of amastiff his second is like the spring at thethroathomer alone has enriched the languagewith sentences full of harmony how long hisverse was created how long his gods had livedbefore him how long he himself before usis yet uncertain although herodotus is of opinionthat he is nearer to us than pericles andanaxagoras admit but these two philosophersplace sun moon and stars beyond all reasonablelimits i know not how far offwe none of us know said pericles butanaxagoras hopes that in a future age humani pericles and aspasiaknowledge will be more extensive and morecorrect and meton

modusand aspasia lated by the same masterkey sophocles toocertainly less jolted than you would suppose bythe deep ruts angular turns and incessant jerksof the iambic tells me that he finds no otherheroick verses at all resembling it in therhythm and that to his apprehension it is notdissimilar in the two poemsbut i must continue while i remember themperfectly the words of periclesthe

there were sheep and goats at pasturethere were ruins beyond but neitherof a great city nor of an ancient one theonly ancient walls i saw were on the europeancoast those of byzantion which aspasia claimsas the structure of miletus and which thepeople of megara tell us were founded by theirforefathers less than two centuries ago butneither miletus nor megara was built whenthese walls were entire

mountains inthe interior the cabiri still hold samothraceand we may almost hear the cries ofhuman victims in the northif there were any true history of the timeswe are exploring perhaps we might find in itthat many excursions combined and simultapericles and aspasia nous had utterly failed and that the disastersof many chiefs engaged in them were partlyconcealed from the nations they governed bythe sacred veil of poetry of those who arereputed to have sailed against troy none returnedprosperous none with the men he hadled out most were forbidden to land againupon their native shores and some who attemptedit were slain such is usually the fateof the unsuccessful it is more probable thatthe second great naval expedition of the greekswent out to avenge the disasters of the firstthe argonauts and the result was nearly thesame of the argonauts few returned spartalost her castor and pollux thessaly her jason and i am more disposed to believe that thehead of orpheus rolled down the phases thandown the hebrusthe poets gave successes which the godsdenied but these things concern us little pericles and aspasiathe poet is what we seek needless is it to remarkthat the iliad is a work of much reflectionand various knowledge the odyssea is themarvellous result of a vivid and wild imaginationaspasia prefers it homer in nearlythe thirty years which i conceive to have intervenedbetween

rehearsed it the iliad as a song of warriorsand divinities worthy of the goddess herselfto sing before the worlddemonstrate that metaphors are discoverabledrawn from things believed to have beeninvented in the homeric age what does itprove merely that homer who lived amongthe islands and among those who had travelledinto all the known regions of the world hadcollected more knowledge than the shepherdsand boarhunters on the continentdemonstrate that some books in the compilationretain slight traces of a language notexactly the same as the others what thenmight they not have been composed while hevisited countries in which that dialect was indigenousor might they not have been found there pericles and aspasiaat the first collection of the songs having undergonesome modification from the singers adaptedto the usages and phraseology of the people alio doubts that what was illegible or obscurein the time of lycurgus was renderedclearer by the learned spartan that somecretan words not the dorian of sparta hadcrept in that others were substituted thatsolon pisistratus and hipparchus had also tocorrect a few of these corrections and manythings more they found a series of songs never was there a series of such length withoutan oversight or gapshall the alpine be sounded in my ear homer may have introduced it by way of allusionin one poem not wanting it in the otherthe grecians of his time never used it inbattle eastern nations did and perhaps hadhe known the phrygian better its blasts wouldhave sounded on the plains of troy he wouldpericles and aspasia have discovered that trumpets had been usedamong them for many ages we possess noknowledge of any nation who cultivated thescience of musick so early or employed sogreat a variety of wind instruments little didhe know of phrygia and as little do we knowof him his beautiful creation lies displayedbefore us the creator is hidden in his ownsplendour i can more easily believe that hishand constructed the whole than that twentymen could be found at nearly the same timeeach of genius sufficient for the twentieth part because in many centuries there arose not asingle one capable of such a production as thatportionarchilochus and simonides are excellentonly in their shorter poems they could nothave whistled so well throughout a long marchdifficulties are to be overcome on both sideswe have no grammarians worthy of the pericles and aspasianation none in any district of greece hathstudied the origin and etymology of his languagewe sing like the birds equally ignorantwhence our voice arises

aggravate it by lowering homerthe loftiest of their workspericles and aspasia aspasia to cleonearistophanes often dines with us neverthelesshe is secretly an enemy of pericles andfearing to offend him personally is satirical onmost of our friends meton whose characteryou know already great in astronomy great ingeometry great in architecture was consultedby pericles on beautifying the streets of thecity which are close and crooked no soonerhad aristophanes heard this than he began tocompose a comedy entitled the birds hehas here represented our quiet contemplativemeton with a rule and compass in his handsuttering the most ludicrous absurdities metonis a plain unassuming inoffensive man andnever speaks inconsiderately the characteris clumsily drawn but that fault was easily pericles and aspasiacorrected by representing poor meton underthe chastisement of the cudgel there is somuch wit in this i doubt whether any audiencecan resist it there is magick in every strokeand what was amiss is mended and made wholeagain ere the hammer falls how easy a wayof setting all things to rights with only onedissentient voice in the same comedy is ridiculed the projectof pericles on a conformity of weights andmeasures in attica and her dependenciesmore wit another beating when aristophanes made us the next visitpericles after greeting him with much goodnatureand after various conversation with himseemed suddenly to recollect something andwith more familiarity than usual took himgently by the elbow led him a little aside andsaid with a smile and in a low voicemy dear friend aristophanes i find youpericles and aspasia are by no means willing to receive the samemeasure as you give but remember the peoplehave ordered the adjustment the surest preservativeagainst fraud particularly that bywhich the poorer are mostly the suffererstake care they do not impeach you knowingas you do how inefficient is my protection itis chiefly on such an occasion i should be sorryto be in a minorityaristophanes blushed and looked alarmed periclestook him by the hand whispering in hisear do not let us enter into a conspiracyagainst equity by attacking the uniformity ofweights and measures nor against comedy bygiving the magistrates a pretext to forbid itsrepresentationaristophanes turned toward pantarces whostood near him and saidi can write a comedy as well as most periclescan act one better than anyvol i k pericles and aspasiaaristophanes in my opinion might haveeasily been the first ijrric poet now having exceptsophocles and euripides he chose rather tobe the bitterest satirist how many adornedwith all the rarities of intellect have stumbledon the entrance into life and have made a wrongchoice in the very thing which was to determinetheir course for ever this is among the reasonsand perhaps is the principal one why thewise and the happy are two distinct classes ofmenaspasia to cleonei had retired before aristophanes went homeon my return it was evident that some onepresent had indeed against the poet's effronteryfor i was in time to catch these words ofpericlespericles and aspasia why should i be angry with the writers ofcomedy is it because they tell me of thefaults i find in myself surely not for he whofinds them in himself may be quite certain thatothers have found them in him long before andhave shown much forbearance in the delayis it because i am told of those i have notdiscovered in me foolish indeed were thisi am to be angry it seems because a man forewarnsme that i have enemies in my chamberwho will stab me when they find me asleep

let it never be said that a citizenof athens was obliged to the most illiberal andpenurious of people for a sustenance not indeedthat there is any danger of sparta entertaininghim too honourably she

applied indeed pericles enjoyed equally the simplicity ofmeton and the slyness of anaxagoras and saidmeton our friend anaxagoras is so modesta man that the least we can do for him is toacknowledge his claims as heir general tohesiod see them registeredi have never observed the temper of pericleseither above or below the enjoyment of a joke he invites and retaliates but never begins lesthe should appear to take a libertythere are proud men of so much delicacythat it almost conceals their pride and perfectlyexcuses it pericles and aspasiameton never talks but answers questionswith great politeness although with less clearnessand precision than you would expect iremarked to him one evening that mathematicianshad great advantages over others in disputationfrom the habitude they had acquiredof exactness in solving their problemswe mathematicians answered he layclaim to this precision i need not mention toyou aspasia that of all the people who assembleat your house i am the only one thatever wants a thought or word we are exactin our own proper workmanship give us timeand we can discover what is false in logick but i never was acquainted with a mathematicianwho was ready in correcting in himself aflaw of ratiocination or who produced the fittingthing in any moderate time composition isquite beyond our sphere i am not envious ofothers but i often regret in myself that whilepericles and aspasia they are delivering their opinions freely andeasily i am arranging mine and that in commonwith all the mathematicians of my acquaintancei am no prompt debater no acutelogician no clear expositor but begin in hesitationand finish in confusioni assure you cleon i have been obliged togive order and regularity to these few words ofthe wise contemplative meton and to removefrom among them many that were superfluousand repeated when he had paused i told himi sometimes wished he would exercise hispowerful mind in conversationi have hardly time said he for studymuch less for disputation rarely have i knowna disputant who however dexterous did noteither drive by truth or over her or who stoppedto salute her unless he had something fine ornovel to display he would stumble over mycubes and spheres and i should leave my legin his noosem pericles and aspasiaand yet anaxagoras and you agree welltogether said ianaxagoras replied he usually asks meshort questions and helps me himself to explainthem he comes to me when i am aloneand would find no pleasure in showing to othersmy perplexity seldom do i let him go againuntil he has given me some help or some incitementin my studies he suggests manythingssilence good meton cried anaxagorasor i may begin to talk of a luminary whoselight has not yet reached the earththe three men smiled they have some meaningcommunicated to me perhaps it is a remarkof pericles in encouragement of anaxagorasthat while others pass before us like ahalfobol towlink across a dark alley anddazzle and disappear his loftier light has notyet come down to the intellects of his fellowpericlesand aspasia citizens or perhaps it may really have a referenceto some discovery in astronomypericles goes in person to command the expeditionagainst samos he promises me itwill soon be ready to sail and tells me to expecthim back again within a few months artemisis preparing machines of great magnitude forthe attack of the city he teaches me that thesamianss are brave and wealthy and that nocity is capable of such a resistance certainlynever were such preparations i hope at leastthat the report of them will detain your

its understandingwould listen to and believe the report ignorantthat arbitrary power has never been carried tosuch extravagance even in persia itself althoughit is reported that in india the lower orders ofpeople were hereditarily subject to the dominationof a privileged class but this may be pericles and aspasiafalse and indeed it must be if what is likewisetold us concerning them be true which isthat they have letters among themaspasia to cleoneyou have given me in your two last lettersa great deal of curious information about thediscoveries that the demagogues made or pretendedto have made in samos it is credibleenough that the oligarchy were desirous of transmittingtheir authority to their children butthat they believed so implicitly in the infatuationof the citizens or the immutability of humanevents as to expect a continuation of power inthe same families for seven generations is toogross and absurd even to mislead an insurgentand infuriated populace he indeed must becomposed of mud from the nile who can endurepericles and aspasia with patience this rancorous fabrication inegypt we are told by herodotus in his eratothat the son of a herald is of course a herald and if any man hath a louder voice than he itgoes for nothinghereditary heralds are the proper officers ofhereditary lawgivers and both are well worthyof dignity where the deities are catsstrange

enormityhave been detected by the samianss in theiroverthrown government what exasperates thepeople most and indeed the most justly is the pericles and aspasiadiscovery that the ruling familles have grosslyabused the temples to the high displeasure ofthe gods sacrilege has been carried to sucha pitch that some among them have appointeda relative or dependent to the service of morethan one sanctuary you remember that ancientlyall the worship of this island was confinedto juno she displeased the people iknow not upon what occasion and they sufferedthe greater part of her fanes to fall in ruinsand transferred the richest of the remainder tothe priests of bacchus several of those whohad bent the knee before juno took up thethyrsus with the same devotion the peopledid indeed hope that the poor and needy andparticularly such as had lost their limbs in waror their parents or their children by shipwreckwould be succoured out of the wealth arisingfrom the domains of the priesthood and therather as these domains were bequeathed bypericles and aspasia religious men whose whole soul rested uponjuno and whose bequest was now utterly frustratedby taking them from the sister of jupiterand giving them exclusively to his son besideit was recollected by the elderly that out ofthese vast possessions aid was afforded to thestate when the state required it and thatwherever there stood one of these templeshunger and sickness sorrow and despair werecomforted and assuaged the people it appearsderived no advantages from the changeand only grew more dissatisfied and violentfor if those who had officiated in the temples ofjuno were a little more licentious than becamethe ministers of a goddess they did not runinto the streets and through the country placesdrunk and armed nor did they seize upon thegrapes because they belonged to bacchus nor upon the corn because it is unwholesometo drink wine without bread nor upon the pericles and aspasiacattle because man cannot live on bread alonethese arguments you may suspect of insufficiency what then will you think when you hearanother reason of theirs which is that thenation has no right to take from hem whatbelongs to the goddess the people cryhow then can it belong to you pushed uponthis side they argue that they cannot be deprivedof their salaries because they are fromland what reply the citizens are not goldand silver the products of land also butlong possession we will remedy that too aswell as we can the soldiers and sailors havethe most reason to complain when they seetwelve priests in the enjoyment of more salarythan seven thousand of the bravest combatantsthe military are disbanded and deprived ofpay at the instant when their services are nolonger necessary yet no part it appears of asuperfluous and idle priesthood is to be reducedpericles and aspasia or regulated on the contrary it is rapaciousand irreligious to take away three temples froma venerable occupant of four was ever soldierso impudent as to complain that rations werenot allowed him in four detachments of hisarmy the downfall of the old faction will beof little benefit to samos while these insultsand iniquities press upon the people unlessthose who are now entrusted with power resolveto abolish the gross abuses of the priesthoodthe wealth of which is greater and worseapplied in samos than it is even in thosecountries where the priests are soprano andvenerated as deities little imports it by whomthey are governed or what gods they venerateit is better to be ruled by the kings of lacedaemonand wiser to salute in worship the sunof persia never surely will the island be pacifieduntil what was taken from juno shallalso be taken from bacchus and until the pericles and aspasiarichest priest be reduced in his emoluments farbelow the level of a polemarchaspasia to cleonethose of your letters my cleon which relateto the affairs of samos and especially to thepriests of juno and bacchus have led me intomany reflections the people of athens arethe most religious of any upon earth but idoubt whether they are the most just the mostgenerous the most kindly there is not afriend whatever benefit they may have receivedfrom him whom they would not abandon ordenounce on a suspicion of irreverence to pallas and those in general are the most fanaticaland furious whom as goddess of wisdom shehas least favored your neighbours the sapericlesand aspasia means are more judicious in their worship ofjuno they know that as long as jupiter hatha morsel of ambrosia she will share it althoughhe may now and then indulge in a draught ofnectar to which her lips have no access tiesamianss have discovered that wealth is not arequisite of worship and that a temple needsnot a thousand para sangs of land for its inclosureif we believed that gods could be jealouswe might fear that there would be much illblood between juno and bacchus it is moreprobable that they will look on calmly and lettheir priests fight it out the persians inthese matters are not quite so silly as we areherodotus tells us that instead of altars andtemples the verdure of the earth is chosen fortheir sacrifice and musick and garlands prayersand thanksgivings are thought as decent andacceptable as comminations and blood it doesnot appear that they are less moral or less re pericles and aspasiareligious than those who have twenty gods andtwenty temples for each the wiser men inathens tell us that the vulgar have their prejudiceswhere indeed is the person who neverhas repeated this observation yet believe mecleon it is utterly untrue the vulgar havenot their prejudices they have the prejudicesof those who ought to remove them if they hadany interested men give them not their religionbut clubs and daggers for enforcing
