bosom refusedto be relieved of its loadwhile eleanor was thus plunged in afflictionmrs mowbray's speculations and in a lessdegree those of her son were directed towardsthe same object ranulph rook wood busiedin revolving the singular though as yet unintelligibleavow al he had made of a possible changein his fortunes she exerted all her force ofmind to discover some clue to the mystery achange in his fortunes this change had noreference to lady rook wood that idea he hadhimself refuted and indeed she was aware ofthe unalienable nature of her brother's propertycould it relate to herself it had been in thepower of her father sir reginald rosewoodwho had created the entail to have disposed ofhis lands as he saw fitting but he had disposed ofthem so she had heard and the issue male of hisrook wood sons were named in the succession and sheherself in her last dread interview with herfather the recollection of which was graven likethe cicatrice of a wound upon her memory awound that had its seasons of throes and shootingtortures had heard his declaration that sheherself should be for ever excluded from hispossessions from participation in his wealth that she should be a stranger to his name tohis house to his blood after sifting everysuggestion carefully she became satisfied that ifa new claimant had sprung up to rosewood itwas in the same character that ranulph himselfderived his title and the more closely she canvassedher brother's early life the more fullyassured she became of the correctness of herconjecturesfrom whatever source derived mrs mowbraywas intimately acquainted with sir piers's unfortunateattachment to susan bradley andaware also that there had been offspring bornto them she could not dwell upon the detailthat had been given of her brother's devoted rosewoodlove and the descriptions of susan's matchlessbeauty without arriving at the conclusion thatin the ardour of passion he had yielded to theentreaties and blandishments of this lovely andseductive girl and secretly espoused her butfrom the circumstance of her lowly originhad hesitated to avow his union when hersudden death prevented the necessity of disclosurethis hypothesis did not it is trueaccount for her brother's subsequent desertionof his child but when mrs mowbray setthe weakness of sir piers's character in thebalance with the resolute qualities of hiswife she perceived which was likely to preponderateand that if he had ever conceivedthe intention of avowing his marriage hisapprehensions of the consequences as was inreality the fact would have deterred him fromopen acknowledgment this suspicion onceawakened in mrs mowbray's mind receivedabundant confirmation in her opinion fromranulph's halfexpressed hints and his suddenand mysterious appearance at the funeralrookwood and who was he who should now be heir torosewood this was a question she had nomeans of answering she knew nothing andcould conceive nothing but her curiositynevertheless was strongly excited on this head the more so inasmuch as she was unable in theslightest degree to gratify it another considerationfrom which she shrank with a sense ofextreme uneasiness for cold and haughty asshe was mrs mowbray was not utterly devoidof sensibility was whether in case ranulphrosewood should be supplanted in his inheritanceshe would dechne his suit of eleanorshe would fain at this moment have shunnedthis self investigation the response she feltwould be too prompt she could not accepthim for her sonmrs mowbray it must be remembered wasthe elder born of sir reginald rosewood shewas also the daughter of his gentle bride thelady eleanor but she partook more of thecalculating pride and vindictive sternness whichdistinguished her father than of her mother's lockwoodsofter attributes the legacy of vengeancebequeathed by her dying parent which shetacitly accepted even as a child and resolvedupon executing could not have been delegatedto a hand more capable of its ministrationnothing but her own degradation and toher a mesalliance such as she formed was thegreatest degradation that could have befallenher both in her own esteem and in that of sirreginald could inflict the blow she wished tostrike she at once determined to immolateherselfthe story has been already told plightedto an earl she fled with a paper no overwhelmingsentiment of love influenced her inthis unworthy choice no thought save that ofheaping the bitterest mortification upon herfather's head induced its commission but shehad studied sir reginald's character and in hisonly assailable point she stabbed him theblow went home but revenge is a twoedgedsword the blade smote either wayunited to one whom she neither respectedrook woodnor regarded unsupported in her fallen stateby love which alone could have buoyed herup amid the stormy sea into which she hadplunged consumed by secret pride which likethe spartan youth who sustained unflinchingthe fiery coal that fell off the altar she borewithout complaining tortured by all the horrorsof poverty and to the proud heart therecan scarce be greater horrors she felt that ifshe had succeeded in wreaking her vengeanceupon her father the injury she had done herselfwas the more lasting and irremediablestill through it all her firmness of characterforsook her not fallen she might be yet itwas by her own act that she fell and shewould have died rather than utter a murmurhave endured a martyrdom sooner thanseek for a reconciliationbrighter days did indeed dawn upon hera slight accession of fortune restored her tocomparative independence and her husband'sdecease shortly after liberated her from a certaincontroul which she had found irksome andb rookwoodcompleted her emancipation by prudent managementand by entirely residing abroad inastate of seclusion and in a style of themost rigid economy she had greatly increasedher means but still with a sense of her ownsufferings fresh in her remembrance she determinedthat never with her consent shoulda daughter of heres wed other than a wealthysuitorwith this disposition it may be readily conceivedmrs mowbray would view any materialchange in the condition of ranulph rookwoodas an absolute bar to his union witheleanor and that she did regard it in that lightwas certain the match between the cousinsshe considered as in every way desirable nayas most eligible and the coldness with which shereceived ranulph's advances upon the intimacyarose from the haughty reluctance on her partto be the first to make overtures of peace thedifferences between the father and daughterhaving extended to the other children asranulph appeared fixed in his attachment androok wood had incurred his father's resentment by his consistentadherence to his election acceding onlyto a temporary estrangement from the object ofhis affections with the express determination ofrenewing his offer at the expiration of thatperiod of probation and as eleanor herselfseemed to be equally involved in the sametender sentiment mrs mowbray tacitly compliedwith her daughter's inclinations andwithout making a remark on the subject sufferedher to remain unmolested up to the timeof sir piers's death and of ranulph's expectedreturn thus when she conceived that all obstacleswere removed a more fatal one presenteditself she trembled for eleanor but the spiritof worldliness prevailed she persuaded herselfthat in the event of the contingency ofwhich she was apprehensive it was her dutyto break off the proposed alliance little sophisticationwas required to satisfy her scruplesprudence and policy formed her mental salvoit is surprising how easily people considerthemselves guided by a sense of duty when rookwoodinterest and inclination are at hand to directthemand eleanor as she stole a furtive glanceat her daughter and saw her evident perturbationsome perception of the cruelty of such anact towards her darling child was awakenedwithin her bosom but the feeling was transitorylittle of the softness none of theweakness of her sex pertained to mrs mowbraylove was a passion of which she hadoften heard but which she had never feltshe could conceive it but her theoretical andwe might say likewise heretical opinion wasso wide of the reality as to lead her into theerroneous notion that the raging flame couldbe restrained within certain limits and mightbe extinguished altogether should circumstancesrequire it she felt that she was able to do soand reasoning upon that fallacious argumentshe fancied that it would be equally in thepower of her daughter to exercise such contrivedover her affections nothing more she imaginedwould be necessary than the expression of herrookwood wish to be followed by eleanor ready acquiescencesubmission the meekest the gentlestto her mother's behests formed the mainfeature in eleanor's affectionate character compliancewith her injunctions seemed to be theprimary law of her nature as indeed it shouldbe ever in the child but perhaps that tyrannousascendancy which a strong mind is apt toassume over one of weaker constitution andby this epithet we mean that yielding weaknesswhich is woman's strength led sirs mowbrayto exact more obedience from her daughter thanwas consistent with parental tenderness to requireand made the passive submission ofeleanor appear more in the light of subjectionthan of dutyreared in the most perfect

now mysteriously associated withranulph peopling the wilderness with his imageand linking his presence with each favourite spotbright as was its dawn the love of eleanorwas scarce called into existence ere it wascrushed the sky that was filled with the rook woodpurple light of love was suddenly overcast the opening flower was rudely troddendown the chords of harmony were shiveredas soon as

lengthened separation with heartsunchanged with vows unbroken the sky foran instant was filled with rosy hue again butnot as heretofore presentiments of comingmisfortune like chilly winds blighted the joyof their reunion and clouds seemed gatheringin the horizon of their happinesswhile eleanor pursued this tristful trainof reflection the time insensibly wore away untilthe sudden stoppage of the carriage aroused theparty from their meditation major mowbrayperceived that the occasion of the haltwas the rapid advance of a horseman whowas nearing them at full speed the appearanceof the horseman was somewhat singularand might have created some uneasiness asrook wood to the nature of his approach had not themajor immediately recognised a friend he wasnevertheless greatly surprised to see him andturned to mrs mowbray to inform her thatfather ambrose to his infinite astonishmentwas coming to meet them and appeared fromhis manner to be the bearer of unwelcometidingswrapped in a long black cloak with a broadbrimmed hat drawn closely over his brows itwas impossible to distinguish further of thepriest's figure and features beyond the circumstanceof his height which was remarkableuntil he had reached the carriage windowwhen raising his hat he disclosed a head thattitian might have painted and which arisingfrom the dark drapery looked not unlike thevisage of some grave and saturnine venetianthere was a venerable expanse of foreheadthinly scattered with hair towering over blackpenthousewife brows which in their turnshadowed keen penetrating priestlike eyes the temples were hollow and blue veins mightbe traced beneath the sallow skin the cheekslockwoodbones high and there was something in theface that spoke of selfmortification while thethin livid lips closely compressed and theaustere and sinister expression of his countenanceshowed that his selfabasement if hehad ever practised it had scarcely prostratedthe demon of pride whose dominion mightstill be traced in the lines and furrows ofhis haughty physiognomy the father lookedat mrs mowbray and then glanced suspiciouslyat eleanor mrs mowbray appearedto understand himyou would say a word to me in privatesaid mrs mowbray

youwill give your horse in charge to the postillionwe will attend you at once with a feeling of renewed apprehensionconnected she knew not why with ranulphrookwood eleanor beheld her mother and brother descendfrom the carriagefather ambrose was perhaps the only beingwhom eleanor disliked she had felt an unaccountableantipathy towards him which she couldneither extirpate nor controul during their longand close intimacy it may be necessary to mentionthat eleanor s religious culture had beenin accordance vith the tenets of the romishchurch in whose faith the faith of her ancestryher mother had continued and that fatherambrose with whom she had first becomeacquainted during the residence of the familynear bordeaux was her ghostly adviser andconfessor an englishman by birth he hadbeen appointed cure to the diocese in whichthey dwelt and was consequently a frequentvisitor almost a constantinople of the chateau yet though duty and respect would haveprompted her to regard the father with affectioneleanor could never conquer the feelingsof dislike and distrust which she had at firstentertained towards him a dislike which wasincreased by the strange controul in which herookwoodseemed to hold her mother who regarded himwith a veneration approaching to infatuation'it was therefore with satisfaction that she badehim adieu he had however followed his friendsto england under a feigned name as being arecusant romish priest and supposed to havebeen engaged in certain jesuitical plots his returnto his own country was attendedwith considerablerisk and had now remained domesticated withthem for some months that he had been insome way early in life connected with a branchof the house of rosewood eleanor was awareshe fancied he might have been engagedin political intrigue with sir reginald whichwould have well accorded with his ardent ambitioustemperament and the knowledge of thiscircumstance made her doubly apprehensivelest the nature of his present

ranulph's disadvantagewith such misgivings therefore eleanorrookwood watched the motions of the party narrowly inhope to gain some clue from their gesturesto the subject of their conversation from

is obtained turpinturned for an instant to reconnoitre hispursuers coates and titus he utterly disregarded but paterson was a more formidable foeand he well knew that he had to deal with aman of experience and resolution it was thenfor the first time that the thoughts of executinghis extraordinary ride to york first flashedacross him this bosom throbbed high with raptureand he involuntarily exclaimed aloud asheraised himself in the saddle byi will do it rookwoodhe took one last look at the great babel thatlay buried in a world of trees beneath him andas his quick eye ranged over the magnificentprospect lit up by that gorgeous sunset hecould not help thinking of tom kings lastwords poor fellow thought dick hesaid truly he should never see another sunset aroused by the approaching clatter of hispursuers but little behind him dick struckinto a lane which lies on the right of the roadnow called shootuphill lane and set off at agood pace in the direction of hampsteadnow cried paterson put your tits to itmy boys we must not lose sight of him for asecond in these lanesand accordingly as turpin was by no meansdesirous of inconveniencing his mare in thisearly stage of the business and as the groundwas still upon an ascent the parties stillpreserved their relative distancesat length after various twisting and turningsin that deep and devious lane after scaring oneor two farmers and riding over a brood orrookwood two of ducks dipping into the verdant valleyof west end and ascending another hill turpinburst upon the gorsy sandy and beautifulheath of hampstead still shaping his courseto the left dick made for the lower part ofthe heath and skirted a path which leadstowards northend passing the furzecrownedsummit which is at present crested by a clumpof lofty pinesit was here that the chase first assumed acharacter of interest being open ground thepursued and pursuers were in full view of eachother and as dick rode swiftly across the heathwith the shouting trio hard at his heels thescene had a very animated appearance hecrossed the hill the tendon road passedcrackskuu common and dashed along thecrossroad to highgatehitherto no advantage had been gained bythe pursuers they had not lost ground butstill they had not gained an inch and muchspurring was required to maintain their positionbut as they approached highgate dick slackedlockwoodened his pace and the other party redoubledtheir efforts to avoid the town dick struckinto a narrow path at the right and rodeeasily down the hillhis pursuers were now within a hundredyards and shouted to him to stand pointingto a gate which seemed to bar their farther progressdick unhesitatingly charged it clearingit in beautiful style not so with coates'sparty and the time they lost in unfasteningthe gate which none of them liked to leapenabled dick sto put additional space betwixtthem it did not however appear to be hisintention altogether to outstrip his pursuers the chase seemed to give him excitementwhich he was willing to prolong as muchas was consistent with his safety scuddingrapidly past highgate like a swiftsailingschooner with three lumbering indiamen inher wake dick now took the lead along anarrow lane that threads the fields in thedirection of hornsey the shouts of his folio whers had brought others to join them and as herookwood gneared crouch end traversing the lane

of my powers were ito be your husband should be to discharge therookwood souhrette but to the point of my visit wearealone i think but this is a queer housemiss mowbray and this is the queerest part ofit walls have ears they say and there are somany holes and comers in this mansion thatone ought never to talk secrets above one'sbreathbut i am yet to learn sirs said eleanorthat there is any secret to be toldwhy not much i own replied the doctor at least what has occurred is not a secret inthe house by this time what do you think hashappened it is impossible for me to conjecturenothing to ranulph i hopenothing of consequence i trust though heis in part concerned with itwhat is it asked eleanorpray satisfy her curiosity doctor interposedmrs mowbraywell then said small rather more gravelythe fact of the matter stands thus ladyrosewood who as you know was not the rook woodmeekest wife in the worlds now turns out by nomeans the gentlest mother and has within thishour found out that she has some objection toyour union with her sonyou alarm me doctordont alarm yourself at all it will be allgot over without difficulty and only requires alittle management ranulph is with her nowand i doubt not will arrange all to her satisfactionsbut what was her objection asked eleanorwas it any one founded upon my obligationto luke my oath tut tut dismiss that subject from yourmind entirely said the doctor that oath isno more binding on your conscience than wouldhave been the ties of marriage had you beenwedded by yon recusant romish priest fathercheckley upon whom however the lord bemerciful bestow not a thought upon thatmy anxiety together with that of your mother isto see you now as speedily as may be wedded toranulph and then that idle question is set at restpwookwood for ever and therefore even if such a thingwere to occur as that lady rook wood shouldnot yield her consent to your marriage why asthat consent is totally unnecessary we must gothrough the ceremonial without itthe grounds of lady rosewood's objectionssaid mrs mowbrayay the grounds of her ladyship's objectionsinterposed small who liked nobody totalk but himself are simply these and exactlythe sort of objections one would expect her toraise she cannot bear the idea of abandoningthe control of the house and estates to otherhands she cannot and will not relinquish herstation as head of the establishment whichranulph has insisted upon as your right ithought when i conversed with her on thissubject that she was changed butnaturam expelled furc tamen usque recurredi beg your pardon she is and always will bethesamebut why did not ranulph concede the point rookwoodto her i wish not to dwell here i care notfor these domains for this mansion theyhave no charms for me i could he happy withranulph any where but happier any where thanherethe kindhearted doctor squeezed her handin reply brushing a tear from his eyeswhy did he not concede it said mrsmowbray proudly because the choice remainednot with him it was not his to concedethis house these lands all all are thine and it were meet requital indeed that after theyhave so long been wrongfully withheld fromthee thou shouldst be a dependant of ladyrook woodwithout going quite so far as thatmadam said the doctor it is but justiceto your daughter that she should be put infull possession of her rights nor should ifor one instant advise or even consent to herinhabiting the same house with lady rosewoodher ladyship's peculiarities of temper are suchas to preclude all possibility of happiness butrookwood at the same time i trust that by management always by management madam her ladyship'squick departure may be ensured i understandthat all such legal arrangements in the way ofsettlements as could be entered into betweenyour daughter and her future husband are completedi have only to regret the absence of myfriend mr coates in this momentous occurrenceit vill be a loss to him but hark i hearranulph's step in the gallery he will tell usthe result of his final interview i came to giveyou advice my dear added the doctor in a lowtone to eleanor but i find you heed it notwhoso humble himself shall be exalted iam glad you do not split upon that rock whichhas broken the shins of half your generationat this moment ranulph rosewood enteredthe room his cheeks were flushed and hismanner agitatedthe whole party were startled by his lookswhat has happened asked doctor smalland mrs mowbray in the same breathranulph hesitated for a moment in hisp eookwoodianswer during which space he regarded eleanorwith the deepest anxiety and seemedrevolving within himself how he could framehis reply in such way as should be least painfulto her feelings while with instinctive apprehensionof coming misfortune miss mowbrayeagerly seconded the inquiries of her friendsit is with great pain said he at length inatone of despondency not unmingled with displeasure that i am obliged to descant uponthe infirmities of a parent and to censure herconduct as severely as i may do now i feel theimpropriety of such a step and i would willinglyavoid it could i do so in justice to my ownfeelings and especially at a moment like thepresent when every hope of my life is fixedupon uniting you dear eleanor by ties almostas near as my own to that parent but theinterview which i have just had with ladyrosewood the bitter heartbreaking interviewcompels me to reprobate her conduct in thestrongest terms as harsh unjust and dishonourable and if i could wholly throw off the sonrookwood tas she avows she has thrown off the mother ishould unhesitatingly pronounce it as little shortof dear ranulph said eleanor palpitatingwith apprehension i never saw you so muchmovednor with so much reason rejoinedranulph for myself i could endure anything but for you and does your dispute relate to me askedeleanor and is it for my sake that youhave braved your mother's displeasure is itbecause lady rosewood is unwilling to resignthe control of this house and those lands totrie that you have parted in anger with yourmother was this the cause of your quarrel it was the origin of it replied ranulphmother said eleanor firmly to mrs mowbray go with me to lady rosewood'schamberwherefore demanded jvirs mowbray question me not dear mother or let mego alone rookwooddaughter i guess your meanings saidmrs mowbray sternly you would relinquishyour claims in favour of lady rookwood is it not so since you oblige me to answer you mothersaid eleanor blushing i must admit thatyou have guessed my meaning to ladyrosewood as to yourself i would be a daughteras far as is consistent with my duty added sheblushing still more deeply but my first considerationshall be my husband and if ladyrosewood can be content but pray questionme not further accompany me to her chambereleanor interposed ranulph dearesteleanor the sacrifice you would make isnecessary uncalled for you do not know mymother she would not i grieve to say itappreciate the

carerookwood that in her own house my daughter shall remainfree from insultmother dear mother said eleanor donot wilfully misunderstand himyou can be little aware madam saidranulph calmly but sadly how much ihave recently endured how much of parentalanger how much of parental malediction ihave incurred to save you and your daughterfrom the indignity you apprehend as ibefore said you do not know my mother norcould it enter into any wellregulated imaginationto conceive the extremities to which theviolence of her passion will when her schemesare thwarted hurry her the terms uponwhich you met together will not escape yourrecollection nor shall i need to call to yourmind her haughtiness her coldness thatcoldness has since ripened into distrust and thematch which she was at first all anxiety

givea reason for her actions or her wishes it isall sufficient to express them but i haveperceived that as the time has drawn nigh forthe fulfilment of my dearest hopes her unwillingnesshas increased until today what hadhitherto been confined to hints has been openlyexpressed and absolute objections raised suchhowever is the peculiarity of her temper that itrusted even at the eleventh hour i should beable to work a change but no our lastmeeting was decisive she commanded me tobreak off the match at once and peremptorilyi refused pardon me madam pardon medearest eleanor if i thus enter into particulars but it is absolutely necessary now that i shouldbe explicit enraged at my opposition to herwishes her fury became ungovernable withappalling imprecations upon the memory ofmy poor

mowbray listened to ranulph's explanationin haughty displeasure eleanor withthrobbing tearful interest doctor small withmixed feelings of anger and astonishmentlady rosewood's conduct said the doctoris you must forgive me my dear ranulph forusing strong expressions outrageous beyond allprecedent and only excusable on the ground ofinsanity to which i wish it were possible wecould attribute

thelife he had recently led deprived almost ofnatural rest goaded by remorse his framewas almost worn to the bone while his countenanceonce dark and swarthy was nowblanched and colourless as whitest

for though staunched the effusionhad been sufficient to cause great faintnesshis dark eyes blazed with their wonted fire naythey looked darker and larger from his exceedingpaleness and so much of

notice he quickly departedhe was once more within the churchyard once more upon that awful stage thereon hehad chosen to enact for a long season his latefantastical character and he gazed upon thechurch tower glistening in the moonshine thegreen and undulating hillocks the chequeredcrosssticks the clustered headstones and theblack and portentous yew trees as upon oldfamiliar faces he mused for a few momentsupon the scene apparently with deep interesthe then walked beneath the shadow of one ofthe yews chaunting an odd stanza or so of oneof his vild melodies wrapped the while itrook woodwould seem in affectionate contemplation of thesubject matter of his song the yewa noxious tree is the churchyard yewas if from the dead its sap it drew dark are its branches and dismal to seelike plumes at death's latest solemnityspectral and jagged and black as the wingswhich some spirit of ill o'er a sepulchre flings oh a terrible tree is the churchyard yew like it is nothing so ghastly to

with the key in the lockhere he resolved to abide luke's coming thereader knows what probability there was of hisexpectations being realizedfor awhile he paced the tomb wrapped ingloomy meditation and pondering it mightbe upon the result of luke's expedition and thefulfilment of his own dark schemes scowlingfrom time to time beneath his bent eyebrowscounting the grim array of coffins and noticingwith something like satisfaction that the shellwhich contained the remains of his daughterhad been restored to its former position hethen bethought him of father checkley's rookwoodnight intrusion upon his conference with lukeand their apprehension of a supernatural visitationand his curiosity was stimulated toascertain by what means the priest had gainedadmission to the spot unperceived and unheardhe resolved to sound the floor and see whetherany secret entrance existed and hollowly anddully did the hard flagging return the strokeof his heel as he pursued his scrutiny atlength the metallic ringing of an iron plateimmediately behind the marble effigy of sirranulph resolved the point there it wasthat the priest had found access to the vaultbut alan's disappointment was excessive whenhe discovered that this plate was fastened on theunderside and all communication thence withthe churchyard or to wherever else it mightconduct him cut off but the present was notthe season for further investigation and tolerablypleased with the discovery he had alreadymade he returned to his silent march aroundthe sepulchreat length a sound like the sudden shuttinglockwood of the
