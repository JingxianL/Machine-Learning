robert the second of thatname and the first of the starts was longgathered to his fathers but he had left behindheirs and successors as all monarchsand other great men naturally do and fromthem and out of their pretensions arose theincidents and matter of this strange and verysolemn taleit happened in the lusty years of his juvenilitythat the same king robert had entervoli a the spaewifegained an effectual dalliance with a fair andcomely damsel called elizabeth the daughterof sir adam mure of rowallan and byher he hqd a progeny of sons and daughtersfor causes and reasons but whether ofstate or of inconstancy is not set forth neitherin the histories of the time nor in the chroniclesof the kingdom this robert during thelife and reign of his uncle king david thesecond estranged himself from the gentleelizabeth mure by which great disloyaltyon his part she was stricken with sorrow andlanguishing in the solitude of neglect shedrooped her head and became pale and piningand died with a heavy sighhe afterwards addressed his amorous aspirationsto euphemia boss the daughterof the proud and warlike earl of that nameand was to her publicly married with allthe pomp and pageantries befitting the weddingof the heir to the scottish crown withthis lady he lived several years and begat he spaewife according to the custom of die age sonsand daughters of whom walter lord ofbuchan and earl of atholl caithness andstrathearn is ordained to act a principal partin this our olden and eventful historyabout the end of king david's reign thelady euphemia boss being dead robertrepented of his infidelity towards that sweetand patient gentlewoman elisabeth mureand acknowledged before the king his unclethat she had been his wedded wife andthat he had procured from his holiness popeclement the sixth a dispensation by whichhis children by her were legitimated andwhen on the death of the king he ascendedthe throne the first exercise of his regalauthority and princely influence was to procureby a strong handling of the interestsand loyalty of the states of the kingdom inparliament assembled an act of declarationwhereby the children of his first love elizabethmure were admitted as his rightfulf the spaewifeheirs and of an elder order than those of thelady euphemia rossthus was the venom of dissension fromthe beginning instilled as it were into the bloodof the princes of the royal house of stuartand thus did their progenitor while intendingjustice and atonement work out against hisown offspring a machination of prerogativefraught with the seeds of irremediable enmityis it therefore to be wondered that therighteous heavens with an unparalleled amstanceof displeasure have continued throughso long a succession of bloody and funerealevents to manifest their judgment on thedoomed and guilty race but not to expatiate on those old and earlycrimes let it suffice to say that althoughduring the remainder of king robert's dayshe partook of some calm and consolation inthe reflection of having atoned as far as hethen could to the fair and mild elizabethmure for the blight he had cast on her famepptthe space wife and honour ill the bloom of her youth andbeauty he had not long departed

discontented with his fortunesbut though the duke so yearned to be allking and though the earl of athos repinedat the unjust exclusion which as he conceivedhe was suffering from his right still

to pleathespaewipe sentries in the celtic tongue with the ladieswho were so highly accomplished in that eruditelanguage that they never thought of conversingin any othere the spaewifechap xwhile bishop finlay was on his embassadethe countess of ross passed by the castle ofballot with a goodly troop of fair damselsand a redoubtable guard of gallant squires tosee her kinswoman the beautiful sibilla macdonalddaughter to the lord of the islesembarked at dumbarton in a galley for theisle of skye they knew not that the lordjames stuart was then in the castle elsethey would not have come by that road forhe was betrothed to the lady sibilla and theruin which had fallen on all his family wasthe cause that made the countess send herhome it happened however shortly afterthe bishop had departed from ballot castlethat the lord james with a numerous trainthe paewife had gone forth to take the pastime of hunting and while he was on the hills he discoveredthe gay retinue of the ladies movingdown the banks of the river and curiousto know who they were and for what occasionso many gentles in glittering attireshould be travelling at such a time in thatdirection he rode hastily towards thembut when he came near enough to discernthat the gallants were gentlemen of the earl ofross's train and saw the stately countessherself on her quiet grey palfrey with herhood thrown back that she might be fannedby the cool freshness of the gale and beheldby her side on an ambling jennet a slenderand delicate lady all veiled like a cisterciannun he was shaken with a strange anxiety for in the graceful movements of that gentlelady albeit the dejection with which shedrooped her head was unlike the sprightlyair of her wonted carriage he discerned thebride to whom but for the sudden visitation the pabwifeof the king's displeasure he was soon tohave been married and the thought came tohim as it were with the flash and scorchingof lightning that all hope of their union wasdestroyed and that she was then departingback to the house of her father never to returnfor himhe reined his horse on the brow of thehill that overlooked the road and then alightedand held it by the bridle his heart beatthickly hitherto the spirit of indignationand revenge had animated him with fierceresolutions and the sense of the adversitywhich had overtaken himself and the thoughtof the ruin which hung over his father andhis father's friends had borne him above thegrief of his condition but the sight of theapproaching cavalcade made him feel that hissituation was one too in which sorrow had aheavy parthis first motion was to advance and makehimself known but without being almostthe spaewife conscious of the reason why he did so he hadsuddenly leapt from the saddle and he remainedirresolute with the bridle in his handtill he was observed by one of the gentlemenof the lady ross's retinue by that timeseveral of his own train had seen the partyapproaching and they came towards himthat they might be ready to assist or to obeythe attention of the countess was directedtowards the spot where the lord james stoodand she halted her palfrey and raising herright hand to skreen her eyes from the sunlooked up the hill for the space of two or threeminutes without speakingshe then called one of her servants to sendhim forward to inquire who the stranger wasthat seemed disposed to interrupt her progress for so she interpreted the attitude andintention of the lord james from the numbersand haste of his followers assemblingfrom all parts of the hill but her train hadquickly discovered that it was the outlawed the spaewipeprince and the man whom she had summonedto send forward knowing the effectthat the news would have on the lady sibillainformed the countess in a whisper that itwas her betrothed bridegroomfor a moment the lady ross wist not whatto do but after a short reflection she orderedthe servant to ride up to the lord jamesand tell him to come to her at the samemoment bidding the lady sibilla remainwhere she was she touched her grey palfreyand ambled forward to a distance attendedonly by two gentlemen whom she orderedto remain apart as the lord james joinedher what do you intend by this said thecountess surely you can never think ofinvolving a lady whom you have professed tolove in the present ruin and jeopardy ofyour fortunes i entreat you james stuartnot to exasperate by any new outrage theking's justice which is already sufficientlythe sfaewife illroused against the bouse of albany butallow us to pass unmolested sibilla's griefare more than she can well beardp for themercy of heaven and the sake of the blessedvirgin retire and let us pursue our journeyin peacechance alone replied the lord jameshas thrown me in your way but what yousay of sibilla's sorrow is reason enough tomake me stop you it is for me and on myaccount that she is grieved and i cannot asaknight and nobleman but desire to lightenher grief truly it is a kind way to do it repliedthe countess you would console her byadding to those offences which have broughton the proceedings that have withered herhopes be you assured that the king ismuch more likely to pardon treason againsthimself than the abduction of a lady of sibill'srank but my lord you shall nottake her from mesmy train is in bravery and the spaewifenumbers more than equal to yours in sosaying the countess waved her hand and inamoment all the gallants and servants ofher retinue were around her like a whirlwindthe damsels who were left behind screamedand flocked towards sibilla where they alightedfrom their horses and assisted heralso to alightthe train of the lord james had followedhim with anxious eyes and seeing him thussuddenly in the power of strangers they instinctivelythought that the readiest way ofextricating him from the danger into whichhe had fallen was to make towards the defencelessladies conceiving that by so doingthey would probably draw off the main partof the guard by whom he was surroundedand thereby afford him a chance to escapeyou have been rash lady said thelord james when he found himself environedby her train on all sides i meantyou no harm and surely my concern for sithespaewife bill to whom i have caused as you say somuch sorrow ought not to have been thuspromptly visited by an arrestment which maybring my head to the axe you have howevermade me your prisoner lady and isubmit to you as suchif i did not know the cunning that is inyou james stuart exclaimed the countessi would repent me of this but until sibillis safe i will not trust to your protestationssafe my lady she is free and i amyour prisoneri would it ware indeed so replied thecountess see your men have her in theirpower but you may soon have her with yousaid stuart with a smile shall i order theladies to be brought hither i may not trust you said the countesseagerly i cannot be answerable to mybrother macdonald if i bring his daughter the spaewifeinto the risk of being with you situated asyou now areyou cherish a harsh opinion of me saidthe lord james gravely this encounteris accidental and having no warrant nor authorityto arrest me why do you deal sohardly by me in truth lady i throwmyself upon the compassion and clemency ofyour sex consider in what situation sibillaand i so lately stood you say that the ruinwhich has fallen upon me has pierced herheart and blighted her happiness i do assureyou by the honour of my knighthoodthat she cannot suffer more for me than i dofor her this meeting has indeed made meknow what it is to be unfortunate do withme however as you plea se g ive me up tomy enemies carry me to them in sibilla'scompany it is meet that she who was to bemy bride should see me taken to the scaffoldfor to that consummation i doubt not mymisfortunes will now come but ladythe spaewife you will not so far forego the gentleness ofyour own nature as to do all that you willstill commiserate the fate that has divided mefrom sibilla and permit us before we arefor ever separated to bid each other farewell will you order your train then to retire said the countess with hesitationundoubtedly replied the lord jameseagerly and he desired a gentleman of theguard by whom he was surrounded to go forone of his menwhen this storm has blown over saidhe addressing himself again to the countesssurely macdonald will allow the marriageto proceedit is broken off for the present repliedthe countess coldly but what have youto say to sibilla the lord james smiled as he said alady so renowned for beauty and loversas the countess of ross has been needs noanswer to that question but it cannot be the spaewifethat you intend we shall take farewell beforeso many spectators i will not permit her to be out of mysight i know what you are james stuartand the desperation of your fortunes is notlikely to make you less adventurous than youwere beforewhile this was passing the rossmanwhom the lord james had sent to his traincame back with one of them and his masterordered him to bid his fellows bring the ladiesforwardnot so not so exclaimed the countess your train shall not come nigh us wthe man halted and looked towards hismasteryou put ill thoughts into my headlady said the lord james and turning tothe servant he added u then let the ladiescome by themselvessend off your men rejoined the countessanxiously whereon he said aloudspaewife tell them to retire but in giving thisorder he glanced his eye to the hill and theriver which the countess observing clappedher hands as the man rode off and exclaimed we are undone you allow your terrors lady to overcomethe wisdom and discretion for whichyou are so justly renowned said the lordjames coolly and raising his bridle he movedhis horse close to her palfrey which as if byaccident he touched so sharply with his spurthat it bolted and almost threw her from thesaddle the confusion which this alarmoccasioned caused an opening in the circleof horses round the prince through whichhe suddenly darted into the rapid river andsoon gained the opposite bank in the samemoment the man who had carried the messageto his train having alighted seized thelady sibilla by the waist and threw her upbefore one of his companions who instantlygalloped off with her to the castle the paewipethe outcries the panic the rushing intothe river the trampling the flight and theconsternation which these headlong incidentsat once produced is not to be told but thecountess of ross before she could rein herpaltry found herself alone the prisonerflown her niece carried off and her trainscattering themselves at full speed on bothsides of the river in pursuit of the fugitivesthe spaewix chap xileaving for a time the lord james stuartand the lady sibilla macdonald to the uncertaintyof their fortunes it is expedient toconsider what in the meantime was doingelsewhere as soon as the earl of athollbad arrived at scone the king held a sessionof the council at which it was determinedto proceed against the prisoners withoutany respect to their propinquity bywhom this advice was urged whether itwas a suggestion of his majesty's own wisdomor insinuated by the earl of athollhas not been divulged but in consequencethereof a high and solemn tribunal for thetrial of duke murdoch with his fatherinlawand two sons all then in custody was orderedto be formed and held at stirling the spaewifewhereat the king in person should preside inhis regal estatein coming forth from the councilchamberafter this austere resolution his majesty tookhold of the earl of atholl by the arm andthey walked together in the verdant meadowsthat lie between the abbeypalace of sconeand the swirling waters of the river tayit was a pleasant afternoon and the greenventuredspring sat smiling in her arbour ofbudding wands and interwoven boughs withmany a sweet blossom in her lap and a youngbird on her finger which she was teaching tohop and singwhile the king and his uncle the earlwere walking along sedately discoursing ofthe cares which then oppressed the royalmind and weighing in the scales of discreetreason the considerations that had prevailedat the councilboard touching the high crimesand misdemeanours of duke murdoch's familyhis majesty would often stop and lookthe spaewfe around and sigh as he inhaled the fragrantfreshness of the free air and beheld the farseenmountaincoronal of breadalbane thenglowing like the purple amethyst to the settingsun for in his youth he was wont tosit in an ancient turret of the towers of hiscaptivity enjoying the gladdening sense ofliberty in the contemplation of the bright andbroad freedom that lies in the boundless expanseof the view from windsorhillwhat eye v said he to the earl canlook on this fair scene without delight andwhat heart think of the misrule that makes itscarcely fit for the abode of man without angerand sorrow ryour highness replied athos hasbut to go on with your intents aggressionsrestrained justice impartially awarded andoffences punished will soon make it worthyof the beauty it has received from heavenand i will go on yes by the help ofgod though i should myself lead the life ofvol i f the spaewifea dog i will make the key keep the castleand the bush protect the cow but it is adreadful thing that the first of my task shouldrequire such severity towards my own kin wis your majesty then really resolved tobring the prisoners to trial said athollwith a look that betokened some latent purposein the question but the king not heedinghis manner for he esteemed his uncle beyondall his counsellors replied franklyis it not so decided can you doubtit give me leave to say my lord that iwas not altogether content with you todayhad the duke done nothing else than striptthe crown of the lands which he has squanderedon his partizans he had done enoughto deserve the heaviest punishment longmust the kingdom rue the consequences ofthe poverty that he has entailed on yourkings he has not left us the means to rewardthe fidelity of a menial how shall weeverbe able to keep in check the arrogancethe spaewife of a nobility so accustomed to rapine wehave neither the means to make it their interestto serve us nor wherewithal to enforcetheir allegiance yes my lord i am resolvedto go on and i look to your able andexperienced wisdom for encouragement andsupport but surely replied the earl shouldthey be found guilty as i doubt not theymust it cannot be your majesty's intention tobring them to punishment why not exclaimed the king surprisedat the remark do you think thatout of any consideration for the power of theirfriends or of any foe i shall be afraid to domy dutyi but thought said atholl humblyu that as they are so near of kin to yourmajesty their lives might be sparedthey are not yet found guilty at leastaccording to law replied the king a batif they were justice knows not propinquity the spaewipethe proceedings against them however shallbe open and before all the world no manshall accuse me in this stern business ofbeing actuated by malice or any other basemotive though the trial will perhaps bringdisgrace on our blood it shall yet be a proudthing for scotland and a glorious vindicationof her longabused justicei cannot however but grieve for dukemurdoch said the earl with a sorrowfulcadence he is my cousinso is he mine interrupted the kingand i grieve that he is so because he hasproved himself so bad a man and his vicewants the grace of bravery for it seems almostquestionable whether his weakness orwickedness is most in fault the nation mighthave pardoned his misrule but humanitycan never forgive the licentiousness in whichhe has indulged his sons as a kinsmanmy lord i have more cause to grievefor them than you for by their deaths ithe spaewife can gain nothing which may not be obtainedby the forfeiture of their estates but you willcome so much nearer the thronethe countenance of the earl changed atthe observation and he looked troubled andcast down his eyes saying your majesty cannot suppose that anyconsideration of that kind would to melighten the thought of the sad destiny whichinevitably awaits so many friends he would have proceeded to say somethingstill more calculated to win the king'scharitable interpretation of the compassionwhich he had shown throughout for the misfortunesof the house of albany but just atthat moment anniple of dunblane rushedfrom behind a hollybush nigh to where theywere then standingking james was not only startled by thissudden obtrusion but filled with wonder atthe wildness of her small bright piercing eyes and his wonder grew to awe as she placed the spaewifeherself immediately before him and leaningwith both hands on a rude sapling whichserved her for a staff gazed steadily at himfor some time and then looked round toatholl with an expression of pleasure soghastly charnel and yet triumphant that theking shuddered and hastily turned awayfrom the contemplation of an object too hideousmystical and undaunted to be seen inthat mood without astonishment mingled withhorrorshe is a poor harmless natural saidthe earl observing the revolting effect whichshe had produced on the king but thecountry folk regard her with superstitious reterencei do not wonder at their dread said hismajesty solemnly but come my lord letus return to the palacestop cried anniple and advancing uptothe king she laid her staff softly on hisshoulder as he moved away atholl surthespaewife prised at this bold familiarity ran forwardand pushed it off and at the same moment theking who was not less amazed turned roundu stop james stuart she resumed droppingthe end of her staff on the groundwhat would you said the king willingto indulge her infirmity and struck withsore pity at the remnants of beggary whichhung around but hid not the anatomy of hershrunken and withered formye wear the crown and the velvet gowncried anniple to his majesty and i have butablanket and a boodle but for all the lands ofbadenoch atholl breadalbane strathernand stratford i would change my build indunblane kirkyard for your bonny queenlady'ssilken bower to dree the penance thatshe maun dreeand wherefore would ye not said theking however she gave no heed to thequestion but dropping her eyes and speakingto herself she murmured out the spaewifboften i have sat on the town braeheadand seen the reek o the happy townhousesand great my een sair that the illdeeds fairieshad made me to live and to be without anykind mother and often in the blithe summernights when other weans were leaping wgladness at through the needleee and wouldna let me play wf them i yearned to stealsome holy abbot's purse to buy myself a weesinging sister or a brother but it's weelfor me i may say now that i never had andnever can know the peril of kith and kinthe earl of athos whole frame wasshaken to so great a degree as she uttered thisdisconsolate soliloquy that notwithstandingthe fascination with which such extremewretchedness had arrested the king's attentionhe observed his emotion and saidi wonder not she says so for the wholecountry cannot but sorrow that i am forcedto proceed so cruelly against so many thatshould have been my best friendsthe spaewife the earl was unable to answer or wasperhaps prevented by his surprise at the freedomwith which anniple went close to theking and raising his surcoat aside touchedhim on many parts of the body with herfingerwhat is this for said the king addingto the earl let her alone my lord i amnot afraid of any spellseightandtwenty bloody wounds i seethem all and the hands that bear the knives let me look at your's lord atholl exclaimedanniple and suddenly grasping himfirmly by the right wrist she looked at hishand and alternately at something aboutthe king yours is not among them my lordand she dropt the hand carelessly at thatmoment two officers came hastily towardsthem and anniple darted awaymessengers said one of the officershave arrived from glasgow with tidings offiso the spaewifea rebellion in lennox headed by the lordjames stuart and the bishop of argyllwhat already in such power exclaimedthe king you see my lord atholl howmuch our worthy kinsmen show themselvesdeserving of mercy this is the submissionyou and others undertook the lord jameswould send in but no matter his quicknessin ill shall not outrun our justice letus return to the palace and call the counciltogether again it is demanded of us atonce to quench this treason and to bring theother traitors to their audit else the wild woman'sprediction may be too soon fulfilledthe spaewifb chap xiibut it was not from the lord james stuartand bishop finlay only that the king hadcause to fear adversaries in arms against hisdetermination to administer justice withoutrespect of persons or of kin of all the adherentsof the house of albany there wasnot one of so bold a spirit as the sir robertgramme before spoken of and no soonerwas it known that he had made his peaceby submission and had been delivered fromdurance than he was expected to show himselfin his true colours and so it came topass for in the same hour in which he was releasedfrom custody he began to plan devicesand stratagems to revenge the wrong whichin his own notion he had sustained and alsopartly to show his gratitude for the manifold the spaewifefavours which he had received at the handsboth of the regent robert and of dukemurdochthough a man of singular obduracy inhis lawless undertakings and ruthless boldand bloody beyond any other chieftain ofhis time yet sir robert held the virtues offriendship in such esteem that he used to sayas it is the duty of all men to support the suffererin a just cause so in like manner is it theduty of friends to stand by one another bethecause of quarrel right or wronghis first endeavours were directed toachieve the deliverance of the lord walterstuart from the bass where as it is alreadytold he had been sent on his arrest for secureward for the lord walter being a knightof undaunted valour in enterprise stout ofheart strong of limb and dauntless in dangerit was thought no castle on the main land wasredoubtable enough to contain so subtle andintrepid a spiritthe spaewife gramme was chiefly moved to think first ofthe lord walter on account of his offenceagainst the king having been of a more openand daring description than the treasons imputedto his father and brothers many holychurchmen had besides accused him of riotousextortions and sacrilegious pillage and gentlemenof good ancestry charged him with irremediableoutrages in their families moreover thepious lady abbess of the nunnery at northberwick had with her own pen written tobishop wardle of st andrews that it wasnot to be told what the lord walter stuartand his reprobate companions had perpetratedin her housebut as the bass stands far in the sea andis difficult of access from a boat save whenthe winds are propitious gramme was forsome time perplexed to know in what mannerhe could convey his mind and intents to theprisoner at last he bethought him of anexpedient very bold and perilous but the the spaewifemore recommended to him by the bravery itdemandedhe hired at the south queen ferry a boatand mariners purposing as he gave out topass thither to frail and thence to st andrewsin fulfilment of a vow which he hadmade in prison as if it was a thing within thecompass of chance that sir robert grammeshould have in sincerity ever any pilgrimageof piety to perform and having embarkedtherein the mariners spread the sails a livelybreeze was then blowing from the westwardand the boat rushed before the wind as if ithad been instinct with eagerness to reach herport but as she approached inch keithgramme began to feign afraid of the waveshe that knew not what fear was and to picturerising blasts and raging seas such as no manin his right mind as he said ought that eveningto encounter by dint of which and exhortationsfollowing thereon he caused themariners to take shelter under the lea of thethe spaewife island in the hope that the wind would inthe course of the night abate for in vain did'they assure him there was no danger and representedthat kirkcaldy was a safer havensince he was not content to continue his voyagesunder the eastern cliff of inch keith theylay till the sun was set and the lights on theshore and the stars in the lift were kindledthe moon but four days old was setting inthe clouds over the pentlandhills and seemedas if she was trailing from the sea a longand rippled line of cold and watery light forthough sir robert gramme still would maintainthat the waves were too rough for hissmall bark to encounter the mariners sawthat they were but twinkling in the moonshinelike the wimpling of a running riverwhen the moon had sunk behind the hillsand the land lay black between the restlesssea and the starry sky gramme ordered thesails to be again spread but when the maristhe spaewifenews as their course lay steered in towards thecoast of fife he rose in wellacted displeasureand accused them not only of having lost theirway but of making for the lothian coastthey protested that they could not be mistakenthat the darkness was not so thick butthey could discern the landmarks and beseechedhim to have confidence in their knowledgeand skillhe was not however to be appeased by theirprotestations on the contrary the more theycontroverted his opinion his anger waxed thefiercer and he insisted that if they would notgo on as he ordered they should returnthey told him it was then too late to returnfor the tide was drifting down but atlast by oaths and imprecations they were inducedto keep more out in a southerly courseto sea and towards morning the bass islegrey and dark was seen rising over the starboardbefore themgramme affected great alarm when he beheldthe spaewife the lofty rugged cliffs and heard the heavynoise of the dashing sea and of the cloudsof the cawing seabird that hovered aroundthe rocks and he sullenly inquired as onethat fears the name of the island to whichthey had betrayed himwhen they told him it was the bass he affectedfor a time a wild and fearful perplexitysaying alas what shall become of me have i been set free from the pleasant heightsof stirling but to be immured on these dolefulrocks then he suddenly seemed torecollect himself saying u but sir patrickwarburton the constable is a true and loyalknight i will tell him in what manner thismisfortune has come upon us steer thereforeto the landingplace i will crave his aidthe mariners well knew that there waseminent hazard to all who dared to approachthat prisonisle when there was any person ofdignity incarcerated there and again wouldfain have refused the order saying that the pabwifenorth berwick was so hard by that he needednot to go to the bass but only to steerstraight to that port he however drewhis sword and wounded one of them in thearm for daring disobedience to his commandsafter the peril they had caused him to passand the jeopardy into which they had broughthim so the men became afraid and thinkinghe was not in his right mind ceased toreason with him but submitted themselves todo whatsoever he desired accordingly hehaving ordered them to make for the landingplacethey lowered their sails and plied theiroars with great vigour and when the boatwas brought under the wall gramme made asad memorial to the guard of what he hadsuffered from his contumacious and unskilfulcrew entreating the soldier to inform the consstable sir patrick warburton who he waswhence he had come and whither he wasgoing and to crave his hospitality until someother bark could be obtained to take him tothe spaewife frail for farther than he had come he wouldnot go save in stress of need with marinersso unpractised as he had found those to bewho had brought him thithersir patrick warburton on hearing thisplausible tale much commiserated the misadventureof the petitioner and came himselfto the port and very courteously invitedgramme to land telling him however thatfrom his orders he must of necessity hold himprisoner till he received instructions from theking i know replied gramme that youcannot do otherwise and i am content to abidewith you it is indeed a thing not to bethoughtthat you sir patrick warburtonwould let me go free knowing as doubtlessyou do that i was so lately imprisoned on acharge of treason for as yet you cannothave heard of my pardonsir patrick was much won by this seemingfrankness of gramme and assured him that the spaewifethough he must hold him as a prisoner yetshould he be as free as himself and that hewould do all things in his power to make himpleasant pastime till an answer came to thereport of the incident of his arrivalam i then the only prisoner on the rockthat you purpose to entertain me with suchfreedom said grammeno replied sir patrick it is not so the lord walter stuart is herethe lord walter stuart exclaimedgramme as if in great amaze is he not yetat liberty i am grieved to hear that for youknow sir patrick we are near of kin andbuthe need not be told by what accident iam here for it is not fit we should hold anycommunion together it would be an illreturn for the king's grace to me were i tohold any intercourse with one that stands sojustly under the cloud of his royal displeasureyou speak sir robert gramme repliedthe spaewife sir patrick as a gentleman and a trueknight who has received a great boon fromhis majesty but there can be no harm invisiting your kinsman in my presence insooth he has of late begun to take his conditionmuch to heart and to fret impatiently athis fortunenay sir patrick it must not be so iwill not offer myself to the company of thelord walter said gramme but you maytell him that i am on the rock and it will becheering news i well know when he hears ihave been pardonedthus with welldissembled policy as theywere ascending from the landingplace to thecastle did gramme gain upon the confidenceof the constable who was an aged knight ofunspotted honour and who executed his harshoffice in so mild a manner as to snake captivityappear beneath his power almost as graciousas hospitality the spaewifechap xiiiwhen sir patrick warburton had conductedgramme into his own chamber in the castleand ordered a repast to be set before him hethen went and told the lord walter bywhat accident his kinsman had been thrownon the island on coming back to grammethey fell into discourse concerning the eventsof the timethe constable informing hiswily guest of many things which though heknew well he yet affected not to know essedally in what related to the disgrace and disastersthat had fallen on the proud house ofalbanybeshrew me sir robert gramme saidsir patrick it is not kind nor courteousof you to be so near your kinsmanand not visit him i shall offend no orthespaewife der in allowing you to see him for thoughmy prisoner i am not commanded to enforceupon him any unusual restraint poor gentleman since he heard of the rigorous arrestof his father and brother he has begun todroop apace i have told him how perforceyou have been driven hitherindeed replied gramme you wouldnot thereby add to his comfort for knowingthe peril of treason in which i so lately stoodmyself he must have marvelled at learning iwas here not at all not at all said sir patrickat first he seemed a little surprised andwas thoughtful but he soon brightened andbegged that i would let you come to himit grieves me sir patrick warburtonsaid the treacherous and wary gramme thathe should have made a request so indiscreetwhat can he have to say to me that maynot be transmitted by you it would onlymultiply the dangers into which he has fallen the spaewifewere we to hold any communion togetherhow does he bear with his prison thoughto be incarcerated is great adversity to one ofsuch accustomed bodily activity yet is hewithal fortunate compared with the closedurance that his father suffers at carlaverockunder sir ralph maxwell of whose insolenceto all that come within the ward of hiskeys you doubtless must have often heard as for edmonstone who had charge of thosethat were with me in stirling i vow to godhe has not the ruth of a highland shorehe kept us apart in cells as if we had beensavage beasts not christian men and madeour dungeons echo with threats that he durstnot have breathed to his own fancy in thefree daylightaye sir robert gramme replied thegovernor we are all in our trusts tooprone to prove our power but surely it becomesnot the honour of knighthood to exasperatethe griefs of the defenceless forthe spaewife my pant i think the least of my duty as constableof the bass is the safe custody of theunfortunate men committed to my care ifeel myself bound to employ all charitieswherewith anguish may be alleviated andprivation solaced to soften and sweeten thehardships of their lot truly it is to me sirrobert matter of affliction that you will notvisit your gallant kinsman but if you willhot go to his chamber with me you cannotrestrain me from bringing him hither it is agrace that i cannot deny myself nay thoughit may at this time move your displeasure iam sure hereafter i shall stand the higherfort in your good opinionwith these words sir patrick warburtonclapped his hands thrice and an officer ofthe guard coming into the room he saidgo to the lord walter stuart and entreatfor me the honour of his presence naysir robert it must not be that you will goaway i pray you be seated againvol i g the sbabwieeon the appearance of the officer grammehad risen seemingly with the intention of retiringbut the earnest manner in which theold knight addressed him laying at the sametime his hand upon his arm and pressinghim with the familiarity of good fellowshipinto his chair obligated him to remainduring the time of this hospitable contestthe officer with three men of the guard proceededto the chamber where the lord wallerwas confined and airing delivered the courteousmessage from the constable they returnedbringing him with them and entered theroom just at the moment when his kinsman hadresumed his seat and before sir patrick hadagain taken his chair at the end of the boardhearing the clank of arms approachingthe door which was presently thrown opengramme looked round

abbot of cambusken tee spaewifeteeth to the end that with his brethren heperform the obsequies tonight as if he knewonly of the rank and nothing of the offenceof the deceased the earl had been so overtaken by thequickness of the king's amaze at his suggestionthat he stood somewhat rebuked whilehis majesty was speaking in so much thatthe king thinking his command to the abbotof cambuskenneth was deemed not enough toensure a becoming pageant addedthe world my lord can expect nomore from me i would have them interredas christian men of noble birth not rememberingthey are executed traitors

of a minuteand then repliedi lay my command upon you in order toshew the abbot how much i shall expect ofhis houses but even now you would haveundertaken to be chief mournershe earl bowed and saying it shall beas your majesty desires retired and wentforthwith to the abbey whither the bodieshad in the meantime been carried and accordingas the king had desired and expectedthe abbot ordered a wide grave to be preparedin front of the altar of the abbeychurchin which at midnight with manychants and holy requiems the interment wasperformedat the conclusion of the solemnity theearl of athos who had remained a spectatorleft the church to return to the abbeygate the spaewifewhere his horse and servants were in attendancein passing over the tombs and graveswhich lay in his way he stopped unconsciouslyand looked up to the calm and cloudleesmoon that in her loneliness seemed as itwere the visible and embodied beauty of tranquillityand silence but almost in the sameinstant a cold and skinny hand took firmlyhold of his and on hastily looking roundhe beheld the charnelhouse visage of thespaewife at his shoulderwhat think you now my lord athos said anniple did na i tell you that

tragedies were acting atstirling the duchess of albany was removedas a prisoner from her pleasant inland palaceat falkland to the strong seawarded fortaliceof pantaloon for it was thought by all menthat her high mindedness would not patientlysuffer such an entire dilapidation of her housebut would prompt her to stir up the friendsof her lord and her father to attempt some enterpriseof rescue or intimidation the apprehensionhowever of the machinations andtreasons in which they had been engaged layheavy on her heart and instead of feelingthe stern instigation of revenge her majesticspirit was weighed down with the persuasionof their guilt and amidst its fears and mourningdid homage to justice still she was notthe spaewife bereft of all hope but trusting to the ties ofkindred she soothed herself with the notionthat whatever might be the issue of the trialsthe king out of respect for his own bloodwould surely never suffer execution to followsustained by this fond flattery she preservedher equanimity and even when the morningof the lord walter's trial came she rose witha serene countenance and only remained alittle longer than she was wont at her orisonstowards the evening however she becamerestless and moved to and fro in her chambersometimes halting suddenly at otherspacing the floor with wild gestures and perturbedsteps and teddy glenjuckie theonly one of her gentlewomen who had beenpermitted to accompany her albeit of a loquacioushumour was so touched with dreadwhen she beheld these outward symptoms ofthe inward anguish that she sat apart ruminatingin silenceat her accustomed hour the duchess re the spaewifetired to her couch but not to rest she wonderedthat no news came from stirling andsometimes her wishes made her interpret thislack of tidings into an auspicious omen inthis state the solemn hours of the night passedaway but sleep came not to her tearful eyelidsat the grey dawn she was seen slowlypacing the battlements casting many a wistfullook towards the west and ever and anonbreathing the low sigh of sadness as she sawafar off the brightening summit of the mountainat the foot of which stood the towers offalkland that home which had been whitenedby the innocency of her children and whichwith them she was destined never to beholdagainall day she was by fits touched as it werewith frenzy still in the midst pf those fearfulpangs the fortitude of her spirit neverdeparted and when the tear was shed andthe shock over she appeared as august andserene as if neither the alarms of a daughterthe spaewife a wife nor a mother had any dominion withinher bosom and she sat at the window ofher chamber in the western tower and beheldthe sun set and the evening close andthe stars lighted up and the moon arise calmlyawaiting the consummation of her fate butstill no messenger came and still the hopethat wrestled with her and would fly awayshe continued to detain with a fond and endearingstruggle at last soon after midnightthe sound of a buglehorn was heard atthe gate it made her start from her seatwith the intent of rushing to the warder'stower to hear who at that time sought admissionbut ere she had half way passedacross the floor she checked her precipitationand returning sedately to her seat desiredher gentlewoman to order candles tobe brought for till that occurrence shehad all the evening remained without anyother light than the moonbeams through thecasement the spaewifescarcely had the menial in attendanceplaced the lights on the table when the captainof the castle entered and said that aherald had arrived from stirling and demandedadmission the captain though anaustere old shorter faultered as he deliveredthe message and avoided her eyes give him admittance i have longedfor his coming exclaimed the duchess risinghastily let him come in let himcome inwhatever his tidings or his officemay bethe captain turned quickly round andhastened out of the room her gentlewomanwho had observed his emotion retiredto a corner and sat down but the duchesscontinued standingafter a brief interval the captain returnedwith the herald who trembled exceedinglyas he approached towards her with a letter inhis hand she saw the paper and snatchedit eagerly from him but instanter the fortithespaewlfe tide of her spirit recovered its firmness andwithout breaking the seal she walked deliberatelyto the candlethe herald who had knelt down to presentthe letter at the moment when she tookit from him continued on the floor andseemed wrapt with amazement when he beheldher open it and peruse it without trepidationit is all over now said the duchesswhen she had read the fatal intelligencethey have all suffered the sentence of thelaw a slight flutter moved her kerchief asshe said these words but she laid the letteron the table and turning to the herald whohad risen from his kneeling she added witha struggling voice if they deserved to dietheir doom was just sir have you anyother business herethe herald was unable to make any replybut bowed as one that is before the hallowedshrine of some glorious martyr and retiredvol i ns the spaewifefollowed by the captain who seemed in hasteto quit the room but before leaving it heturned round and for a moment looked ather grace with scarcely less than religiousreverence and then hurried awaythe duchess till they were gone movednot from the spot where she was standingnear the table but when the door was shutand none present but her gentlewoman sheraised her hands distractedly and with thewildest note of desolate misery cried godhelp me and rushed into an inner roomthe spaewife chap xxviiit eatne to pass some time after the dolorousevents whereof recital has been madethat the king summoned the states of therealm to parliament at perth and thitherrepaired sir robert gramme the fiercest adherentof the faction of the house of albanyhe grudged the frustration of his design forthe deliverance of the lord walter fromthe bass isle as if it had been to himself aninsolent taunt or a galling injury and hisdread of the king's justice was as a spurto his revenge in so much that he ponderedby night and by day in what manner toratify a resentment that blood only couldquench yet though thus borne onward tocrime by the incitements of destiny he wasnevertheless deterred from immediate vengethespaewifeonce by considerations of interest for evenin his wildest and worst passions this remorselessconspirator ever had respect to his estateit is true that the trials and execution ofthe princes smote him with amazement but itsoon passed away and like the violent flamethat bursts forth after the brief damping ofoil cast upon the fire the fiend which possessedhim raged fiercer than everat perth he met with many of the baronagemalcontent with the strict enforcementof the royal authority which hampered themin their feuds and forays and their otherhasty administrations of redress in their ownspecialities and finding them in this moodhe began afar off to work upon their distemperedmindsthis method of rule he was wont tosay which king james has learnt from ourold enemies the englishmay not in itselfi am free to acknowledge be wrong nay idoubt not it accords passing well with thethe spaewife humour of those for whom it was contrivedfor with them charters and statutes have theauthority of rights and justice but it suitsneither our usages nor the temperament ofscottish blood the english at any timewill rather seek another's help than servethemselves and hence it is that they sotamely leave their wrongs to the adjudicationsof judges and juries but it is the natureof every free and trueborn scot to dohis own business and accordingly from theoldest times of the monarchy our kings havenever had leave to meddle with the jurisdictionsof the chiefs and barons in verity ishould be glad to know how a travelling manof law going from town to town with a bookunder his arm like a pedlar can see into thedeservings of illdoers so well as the lordthat lives among them and knows their habitand is familiar with their repute bysuch jurisprudence i grant that the act ofwrong may be well enough sifted but is it the spaewifejustice that the doer thereof should only bepunished for that particular act however badhis forgone conduct may hare been formy part i think the king's prerogative'should be upheld in all things but i donot discern why it is that he has been so illadvisedas to treat his nobles as if they wereall alike and take from us the sword evenin our own defences when he may go to warwith the english or any other crown shallwe say to him he should not and are notourchiefs and barons with respect to oneanother as free to act as kings who are butbarons with a greater vassalage howevernot to speak of that which may be wrongfullyrepeated to our prejudice who can tellwhat will ensue by this new way of takingsubsidies i do not say that king jameshath any ill intent in enriching his treasuryby taxes but if a king have money enoughto keep orders independent of the serviceof his vassals what man of any degree canthe paewif then bra of freedom or call aught his ownwhether the thing be life limb or land by subtle discourses of this bearing he sobeguiled them to his will that in the endthey appointed him to remonstrate with theking against the inroads that were daily madeon their ancient privileges i shall not shrink in the task said hebut then you must be prepared to back myendeavour for i doubt not the king will brook the representation and we all knowif he call it treason it is but another wordfor death now i am not a man that willbe worried like a rabbit i will stand todanger whatever it may be and i care notwhat life may perish in defending my ownit is therefore needful to be prepared forthe worst and i should remind you that thecarl of athos who has been always heartand hand with the king in this newfangledgovernance can never be a fit person to the spaewifename for the regency should our adventurecome to that extremitythus all thing were duly concerted forexecuting at the opening of parliamentwhat had been in this manner determined but when the king appeared on the thronegramme transported with a sudden sting ofire and malevolence forgot the policy he waspledged to follow and rushing upon his majestycried aloudi arrest you sir in the name of the threeestates of the realm here assembled for asyour people have sworn to obey you so areyou constrained by an equal oath to governthem according to their laws and customsand in saying this still grasping the king'sarm he turned round and said to the baronsand prelates there present is it not thusas i say but even those of his own factionwere so struck with consternation at hisrashness and so awed by the serenity whichthe king preserved that they had not heartthe spabwife to give him any demonstration of encouragementtake him to prison said his majestycalmly and he was thereupon seized by thearms and carriedaway bitterly upbraidingthe dastards for whom he had adventured sodaringly the business of the session thenproceeded as if no such bold treason hadbeen attempted and when it was ended hismajesty having retired to his closet sent forthe earl of athos to confer with him concerningthe outragei can discover said his majesty whenthe earl was come before him that the austerityof our impartial administration hasgalled many among you else this audacioussir robert gramme would not have venturedto lay hands on the king in parliamentnow as the end of all government should beto cherish goodwill among the subjectsthere must be some lack of policy if not ofjustice in the rigour of our proceedings there the paewifefore let us speedily redress the grievance iwill pardon gramme for by the bravery ofhis attempt he matched himself as it wereonly with me and since he was none secondedi shall not let it be searched whether orno he had any abettorsit may perhaps be as your majesty says but an outrage so flagrant is beyond pardonif however the mercifulness of your owngracious nature plead for him surely it willbe enough to let him have his life the veryleast that can be meted to him is banishmentand the forfeiture of his estatesto so bold and bad a man as i haveheard even you my lord describe sir robertgramme such a punishment would only be asalicense and warrant to work mischief it may be replied the earl that i havespoken of him in heat for he has ever been themost turbulent of the albany faction buthowever that may have been it is not to bethoughteven though your majesty be conthepaewife tent to pardon the insulting treason done toyourself that the states will overlook thebreach of their own privilegesthe king remained for several minutesruminating and silent and then said this affair troubles me i cannot altogetherpardon gramme without giving offenceto many of the nobility and yet he is a manof such a nature or i mistake the indicationsof character that any measure of punishmenthowever small will become with him a motivefor vengeance i would either deal with himgently or not spare him at allif replied the earl such be yourmajesty's sentiment and you are not movedin the business by any consideration of yourown but only as the matter may effect thepublic weal let the lesser punishment be triedfor whatever impression it may make ongramme himself your royal clemency cannotfail to prove most salutary upon others asi doubt not there are abettors of his treason the spaewitewho at this moment tremble for themselvesthey will be glad to find their heads safe bythe leniency shown to him were he entirelypardoned they would suspect it was donebut to gain time till their whole plot wasfound outthere is something like reason in whatyou say my lord and i will remit the matterinto your hands and yet i know nothow it is but i am not satisfied in compromisingany point of policy with such a daringoffender as sir robert gramme and so sayinghis majesty retired to his chamber andthe earl coming away through the cloistermet bishop wardle to whom he rehearsedwhat had passed between him and the kingknowing that his majesty would probably ofhis own accord tell himi do almost lament saicpthe bishopthat your counsel in this case has prevailed and yet i would not have the traitor pardonedfor i know him well i know him bythe spaewife setta confession which he once made to me whilehe was yet a mere youth scarcely beardedconfession did i call it a bravery ratherof crimes the subtile adder has not moreskill in finding venom to supply the malice ofher bite than that dreadful man in discoveringfit means and instruments for his atrociouspurposesthe earl made no answer to this butseemed so thoughtful that the religious prelaterecollecting his consanguinity to grammeendeavoured to soften the harsh opinion whichhe had thus indignantly deliveredyou are mistaken my lord bishopsaid the earl i am not troubled by whatyou have told me but i dread to think thata spirit so implacable should be set at largegoaded with the sense of punishmentit is nfctoo late to have him brought totrial and condemned said the bishopthe earl gave a short shudder of revolt assq the spaewifeit were at this but in a moment be repliedsedatelythough i know gramme to be themost daring and dangerous man at this timewithin the realm of scotland yet it cannotstand with the king's honour to changein his purpose towards him banishment andthe forfeiture of his goods is the sentence thatwill be executedin advising that said bishop wardleyou have incurred a fearful responsibilityto this the earl made no answer andthe bishop discerning that what he had saidcaused displeasure parted from him nextday when the states again assembled in parliamentsentence was recorded against grammeas the earl of athos had suggested but insteadof going into banishment he was nosooner set free of custody than he retired intothe wildest highlands and gave himself uptowrath and revengethe spaewife chap xxviiione evening soon after the daring adventureof the traitor gramme as the king was sittingalone in his closet pondering of his royal trustsand the ordure that his name might have withposterity he called sir william chrichton thechancellor before him a man richly endowedwith wisdom grave temperate and yet withalof an urbane disposition and said to himthere is a mission of charity sir williamchrichton in which i would fain havethe help of your good offices the forlornestate of that noble lady the duchess ofalbany is a thing that lies very sore uponme whatever were the faults and offencesof her father her husband and her sonsverily she has had cause for great sorrowand though justice might not mitigate the the spaewifemisfortunes that she hath borne yet pitywill constrain us to lighten to the utmost thegrief wherein she sits so disconsolate i prayyou therefore sir william go to her andnot only set her free from pantaloon but undertakefrom me to restore to her whatevershe may desire of the lands and heritage ofher family i give all to your wisdom anddiscretion to act and to do for me as youwould wish to see done by one who wouldearn without the abatement of any presentduty the guerdon of an honourable renownhereaftersir william chrichton did not make anyimmediate response to this command but remainedthoughtful for some time in so muchthat the king added lam grieved sir william that you taketime to consider of this compassionate matteryou do not think in wishing to soften the rigorousadversity that afflicts the duchess ithereby manifest aught which the invidiousthe spaewife world might in its malice or envy impute tomeas an acknowledgment of haying donewrong wno replied the chancellor u far befrom me the thought that your majesty canbe swayed in any good or just or kind intentby the awe of those who look invidiously evenon the virtues of princes but after the terribletask of justice which your majesty has achievedit is meet to be considered whether thetime for remission and indulgence be yetcome the duchess of albany is a ladyfamed for an august spirit and a masculineunderstanding fit it is said for the rule andsovereignty of a kingdom what has befallenher family cannot but have struck sharply andsorely into her heart and of a necessity itwould seem she must bear against your majestyan ireful and implacable mind for it isthe very nature of ill fortune to stir up thoseevil qualities in ourselves which but for adversitymight have slept unknown like the the spaewifefoul toad that lurks under the flower and is notangered till the mower's scythe hath woundedhis back moreover your majesty would dowell to call to mind that her outlawed son thelord james still lives and threatens whathe might do were his mother reinstated evenin no more than the earldom of her father is athing that requires the wisdom of all thecouncil to consider for what may be givento her wilt be given to him and in him theenemy has been but disarmed his animositiesburn as fiercely as ever and it werewell to weigh the consequence of restoring tohim any portion of his arms even though itwere no more than his dirki have thought of all that sir william but we shall have done little for the peace ofthe realm if we cannot venture to pity andrelieve the sufferings of a poor

the king so bent andhaving noted withal the greatness of his motivesin whatsoever he was minded to domade no farther controversy but retiredand went forthwith to pantaloon and whenhe was come thither he was conducted tothe chamber of the duchess who was muchmoved when she beheld him but withoutexpressing any sentiment of the surprise wherewithshe was agitated she waved her handand pointing to a chair invited him to beseatedafter the lapse of a short time in whichsir william remained as if he had expectedthat she would inquire the object of his visithe began to speak of the joyfulness with
