addressed to parentsthese volumes are intended for youngpeople from the age of ten to fourteenthey complete the series of early lessons an humble work from which noliterary fame can be acquired but which ihave been most desirous to complete fromthe belief that it will be more useful thanany other in my power i have had anothermotive for finishing it one whichthough it may be no concern of the public may be permitted to name harry andlucy was begun by my father above fiftyvil prefaceyears ago for the use of his own familyand published at a time when no one ofany literary character excepting dr wattsand mrs barbauld had ever condescendedto write for children that little bookwas i believe the very first attempt togive any correct elementary knowledge ortaste for science in a narrative suited tothe comprehension of children and calculatedto amuse and interest as well asto instruct finding from experience thatit answered the intended purpose my fathercontinued the book at intervals and inthe last part published in i had thepleasure of assisting him he then communicatedmany ideas for the completionof his plan which i thought too valuableto be abandoned i considered that a fullknowledge of his views and long habitsof acquaintance with his mode of teachingmight enable me to do justice to hispreface ixplan though i was aware of the difficultyof combining ingenious with practicableillustrations and still more sensible of theaccuracy requisite for elementary instructionthe want of his mind working alongwith my own i knew must be in this attemptpeculiarly felt but i have beenencouraged to persevere by the assistanceafforded me by his and my own scientificfriends to name these kind and ablefriends would gratify my vanity and mightensure the confidence of parents but itwould perhaps have more the appearanceof ostentation than of candour and mightleaveothers responsible for errors whichhave escaped the most careful revisali have endeavoured to pursue in thisconclusion of early lessons my father'sobject in their commencement to exercisethe powers of attention observation reasoningand invention rather than to teachx prefaceany one science or to make any advancebeyond first principles the essential pointis to excite a thirst for knowledge withoutwhich it is in vain to pour the full tideeven to the lips as dr johnson said toboswell when he was describing the painshis preceptors had taken to give him learningsir anybody can bring a horse to thewater but who can make him drinkconsistently with the sort of instructionto be conveyed it was impossible to giveas much of the amusement arising fromincident and story in this book as in someothers but the varying occurrences ofdomestic life the frequent changes of sceneand the different characters of the childrenwith all their hopes and fears in the pursuitof their own little schemes and experimentswill i hope produce sufficientaction to create interest and to keep awakepreface xiattention no pernicious stimulus has beendriven no deception or cajolery employedto effect our purpose all attempts to cheatchildren by the false promise that theycan obtain knowledge without labour arevain and hurtful the gods sell everythingto labour and mortals young orold must pay that price the wages ofindustry should however be rendered ascertainas possible for the pupils will exertthemselves in proportion to their hopesthat their efforts will be recompensed by thepleasure of success i have taken all theprecautions in my power to secure to eacheffort of attention its just rewardmuch that would be tiresome and insufferableto young people if offered bypreceptors in a didactic tone weill beeagerly accepted when suggested in conversationespecially in conversations bellprefacetween themselves in these there is alwaysa certain proportion of nonsense an alloywhich is necessary to make sense workwell children can go on talking to oneanother much longer than they can bear tohear the address however wise or eloquentof any grown person young people ofgood disposition learn with peculiar easefrom each other because the young teacherhas not forgotten his own difficulties knowing exactly where they lay he seeshow to remove them or to assist anotherover the obstacles the great preceptorstanding on the top of the ladder of learningcan hardly stretch his hand

of science thanthose of literature and may be extendedeven to higher branches of intellectualeducation upon this principle in thefollowing volumes the young brother isemployed to teach his sister what he haslearned either from his father or frombooksharry's abilities and knowledge willperhaps appear a little above his age butthis the reader must excuse and attributeas he pleases to education or to accidentor to natural genius harry will not bedisliked because he is not pedantic andhe has some redeeming faults and foibleswhich save him from the odium attachedmxiv prefaceto a perfect character and from the dangerof being thought too good to be naturallucy on the other hand may at timesseem too childish and volatile her respectfor accuracy not being at first muchgreater than that of the sailor who saidwe'll not quarrel for a handful of degreesbut these faults produce the nonsenseand the action necessary to relieve the reader's attention as to the dangerand the penalties of her becoming anaffected scientific lady it is left to hermother's and her own good sense and goodtaste to guard against that evil all thatcan be said or thought upon the subject bythe other sex is comprised in the edinburghwit's declaration i do not care how blue a lady's stockingsmay be if her petticoats are but longenoughmy father long ago foresaw what everyprefacexvbody now feels that the taste for scientificas well as literary knowledge which hasrisen rapidly and has spread widely wouldrender it necessary to make some provisionfor the early instruction of youth in sciencein addition to the oreat and successfulattention paid to classical literature inpublic establishments alterations evenwhen felt to be requisite must for manyreasons be tardy much in the mean timemay be prepared by private instructionit has been feared by some that thegeneral diffusion of knowledge will tendto damp the energy of genius and thatoriginal invention will decline in consequenceof increased cultivation thismight perhaps be the consequence of injudiciouscultivation if the acquisitionof a great quantity of learning of all kindsor of any kind were made the sole andultimate object the mind would be opxviprefacepressed and invention extinguished underthe mass but of this there is no danger ifthe faculties be proportionably exercisedand if the pupil be enabled to arrangeand above all to employ his knowledgein science the hope of future discoveriesand the ambition to invent are great naturaland neverfailing excitements toyoung and oldthat very ingenious and very mysteriousphilosopher dr hooke speaks somewherein his works of an algebraic formula bywhich he could determine what things arepossible or impossible to perform or toinvent without perfectly crediting orperfectly

their use and abuse havebeen confounded surely it would bedoing good service to bring into popularform all that metaphysicians have discoveredwhich can be applied to practicein education this was

applicationof philosophic principles to trivialoccurrences he believed might be pursuedsith infinite advantage to the rising generationi have now stated all the objects of thisbook how far they have been accomplishedmust be left to time and parentsand above all to children to decidemaria edgeworthmayest mamma do you recollect two yearsago when my father was explaining tousthe barometer and thermometer andwhen he showed us several little experimentssaid lucy and she sighedyes my dear i remember that timevery well said her mother but whydo you sigh because i was very happy then saidlucyand are not you happy now mydear yes mamma but not so very happyas i was then because now i do not goonwith harry as i used to dovol i bhow so i hope that you have nothad any quarrel with your brotherquarrel i oh no mamma it wouldbe impossible to quarrel with harry heis so goodnatured and he is as fond ofme as ever i believe but yet i do notknow how it is we do not suit each otherquite so well as we did we are not somuch together i do not know all he isdoing nor go on with all he is thinkingof as i used to domy dear lucy you and your brotherhave been learning different things forsome time past and as you grow olderthis must be your different employmentsmust separate you during a great part ofthe day and so much the better you willbe the more glad to be together in yourhours of amusement do not you findthisyes i do mamma said lucy but and after this but she sighed again butnow we are not amused always in thesame way harry has grown so excessivelyfond of mechanics and of all thosescientific things which he is alwayslearning from my uncle and papai thought lucy that you were fond ofthose things too said her motherso i am mamma only i am notnearly so fond of them as i was formerly i do not exactly know why but in thefirst place i suppose because i do notunderstand them now nearly so well asharry does he has got very far beforemetrue answered her mother youhave been learning other things which itis more necessary for a girl to knowyes mamma i remember your sayingjust after that happy barometer timethat i thought of nothing but experiments papa said that must not be then i wasnot allowed to go into his room withharry in the mornings however i learnedmore of arithmetic and drawings and dancingand music and workand you grew fond of these so muchthe better said her mother this doesnot make you less happy does itb no no mamma but then came thetime when harry and i sere quite separatedthat long long ltng timewhen you were ill mamma and when iwas at my aunt pierrepoint's while i waswith her i read nothing but stories andpoetry and i heard my aunt and peoplewho were there reading plays she usedto praise me for understanding wit and forrepeating poetry then i grew very fondof them but harry is so grave alwaysabout wit he never understands it atfirst and at last he says is that all as to similes they always interrupthimthei interrupt him said her mother perhaps lucy sou interrupt himsometimes perhaps i do mamma but he always finds out that similies arenot exact this is very provoking iwonder why he is so much fonder of exactnessthan i amprobably because in science whichhe has been learning he finds at everystep the use the necessity of exactnesshe could not go on without it in measuringor in reasoningmammai understand the use of exactnessin some things in drawing inperspective and in proportion by a scaleas you taught me harry came to me theother day and asked me to draw a cartfor him and i was glad to find that icould help him in something and i dare say he will be glad tohelp you in his turn you each knowdifferent things which you can learn fromone another and in which you can be ofmutual assistance this is just as it shouldbe between friendsthank you mamma you make mefeel happy again i will ask harry tobring me up to him in all he has beenlearning as fast as possible that we maygo on together as we used to do if youhave no objection mammado so my dear lucy but i warnyou that you should not expect to gofast you must be content to go slowlyand you must submit to be inferior toyour brother for some time this maymortify you my dear but it cannot beavoided you must bear itevery well mamma i can bear it butmother said lucy hesitating a littlethere is one other thing i want to saybefore i can be quite happy say it then my dear what are youafraid of not of me i hope oh no mamma not afraid of you but i am not sure that the person whosaid what i want to tell sou would likethat you should know that he said ityou can tell me what was said thenwithout telling me from whom you heardit cannot you lucy ican and i will said lucy thenyou must know mamma that one daywhen i was at my aunt pierrepoint's shewas telling somebody that papa used toteach me scientific things along withharry but that since i had come to heri had not learned any thing of that sortand now it comes mamma the gentlemanwho is not to be named laughedvwell there was no great harm inthatno mamma only that he laughed inaparticular sort of way scornfully andhe said that it was well for me i had leftoff such learning that i should be amuch more agreeable woman without itthat ladies had nothing to do with scienceor ought to have nothing to do with ithe said that scientific ladies are alwaysdisplaying what they know or what theydo not know those were his very wordshe said that scientific ladies were his abhorrenceand he looked as if he abhorredthem terribly i was very sorry at thetime that he knew papa had taught meanything along with harry i was ashamedand frightened and i thought it was allwrong but now that i am come homei think that it was all right for i seehow much papa likes that you shouldknow the scientific things that he is busyabout and how happy it makes you andi want to go on again with harry onlyi wish mamma that all people were ofthe same opinions about thisher mother smiled and said thatcan never be my dear lucy you will findmany people have different opinions uponthis subject but all will agree with yournameless gentleman that when womenpretend to understand what they do notwhether about science or any thing elsethey are absurd and ridiculous and if theytalk even of what they understand merelyto display their knowledge they must betroublesome and disagreeable thereforethey should take care not to do so theyshould be particularly cautious of talkingon scientific subjects because they seldomobtain accurate knowledge they aretherefore likely to make mistakes and tobe either troublesome in asking questionsor ridiculous in showing ignorance andconceitthat is said lucy if they set upfor being scientific ladiesyes if they do that they must takethe consequences they will be dislikedsaid her motherbut then mamma i am so muchafraid of being abhorred even if theyare not conceited will they be abhorredmamma not by persons of sense my dearsaid her mother as far as i can judgei think that sensible men would be readyto assist any unaffected unassuming womanwho really wished to inform herselfand would like her the better for beinginterested in their conversation their writingsand their pursuitsi hope then mamma that i shall beanunaffected unassuming womani hope so my dear child said hermother if your father did not hope sotoo he would never teach you any moreon these subjectsi should be very sorry for that saidlucyyes i think you would my dearfor even with your little experience youb feel that there is a real pleasure in goingon as you say with your brother that i do indeed mammaras you grow older continued hermother you will perceive that by acquiringknowledge women not only increasetheir power of being agreeablecompanions to their fathers brothershusbands or friends if they are sohappy as to be connected with sensiblemen but they increase their own pleasurein reading and hearing of scientific experimentsand discoveries they acquire agreater variety of means of employingthemselves independently and at homebut above all the acquisition of knowledgenot only enlarges but elevates themind by filling it with admiration andgratitude towards that bountiful providencewho has established such wise lawsfor the welfare and preservation of theworldyes mother said lucy and after apause in which she reconsidered all hermother had been saying she returned towhat still a little alarmed her imaginationbut yet mamma i feel afraid of beingabhorred and if the acquiring knowledgeshould make me vain there is thedangerthere is the danger to be suresaid her mother but as far as i haveobserved ignorant women are as vainand often more so than those who arewell informed and now when almostall are so educated that they have ataste for literature and some acquaintancewith scientific subjects there is less dangerthat any should be vain of what is no peculiardistinction oh mother i will take the greatestcare said lucy you shall see as igrow up and thank you for explainingthis to meperhaps my dear part of what ihave been saying is rather above yourcomprehensionno mamma not at all if it is notconceited to say so i think i understandit all perfectly well and now i know whatis right and wrong and my mind is settled and i am happy gain and very gladthat i may have the pleasure of learningagain from papa and above all gladthat i may go on again with harry andhere he comes mamma i see him fromthis window coming along the path frommy uncle's oh mamma he has a greatwalking stick in his hand and he is hobblinglike an old man of an hundred andten i hope he has not hurt himselfsaid her mother coming to the window no mamma i believe he is only inplay there the old man is running aswell as ever he did in his life and i willrun and meet himas soon as lucy was near enough tomake her voice heard she asked herbrother why he walked with his uncle'swalking stick as she supposed it to beit is not his said harry it is mine my uncle has given it to meyours and it is quite new i neversaw it before how beautifully varnished and what a pretty head but why did myuncle give it to you harry it would beof use to him and it will be of none toyou said tillythere you are mistaken i beg yourpardon lucy it will be of as much useto me as it would be to him and of thesame sort of use said harry same sort of use said lucy butof what sortguess said harryi suppose you mean in play to act anold man as you did just now no in earnest useful said harrywhat can you do with it said lucyfor you are too young to walk with itand too old to ride upon ittoo old to be sure i am saidharry indignantly i have not riddenupon a stick these hundred years guessagainlucy now wanted to examine this wonderfulstick more closely in hopes of discoveringwhat its merits might be butharry seemed unwilling to let it out of hishandsoh i know what it is it is full ofmoney it is like the staff which theman had in the trial in don quixotewhich sancho panza found out was full ofmoney because he would not let it out ofhis handsi do not in the least know what youmean said harry for there is nomoney in thisthen let me look at it i will not runawaywith it how heavy it is observedlucy what wood can it be madeof this outside seems to be mahoganybut i never felt any so heavy it cannotbe all wood it must be hollow and theremust be something with inside of itstop stop do not shake it do notturn it upside down you will spoil itcried harryho ho then there is something withinsideof it i have found that much outsaid lucy and you say do not turnit upside down like the words on the boxof glass that came last week keep thisside uppermost so i guess that there isglass within your stick you smile thereis glass then perhaps it is a spyglass a telescope a magnifyingglass a microscope no none ofthese what can it be of what usecan glass be in a walking stick harry of a great deal as you will acknowledgewhen you find it out guess againsaid harry it is a thing that you haveseenbut i have seen so many things saidlucyand of which you know the usesaid harrybut i know the use of many things tell me a little more said lucy whatis it used for for weighing something said harry stay i am not sure that it is quite fairto say it is used for weighing a thing andyet it is something i know now said lucy that motionyou made with your hand up anddown against the air told me the somethingthat it is used for weighing is airand it is a barometernow you have found it out saidharryand now i know what makes yourstick so heavy said lucy the quicksilver the mercury i remember feelingthe weight of mercury when papa putinto my hands two cups of the samesize one full of water and the other full ofmercury how stupid i was not to thinkof this at first and not to guess it was abarometer harry now showed where his walkingstick opened and he showed her withinsideof it a barometer and thermometer he explained to her how the quicksilverwas screwed up tight so as to prevent itfrom shaking he told her this was calleda portable barometeryes it is portable said lucy itcan easily be carried from place to placeit must be convenient to travellers butis it in any other way better than the barometerwhich hangs up in papa's room orthan that which stands upon three legs inmy uncle's libraryharry said that he was not sure that itwas better for common use to show thechanges of the weather but this saidhe is not merely a weatherglass as barometersare sometimes called this isintended for another purposewhat other purpose said lucy first let me tell you why my unclegave it to me said harry becatrhe was pleased with my having taken painstwo years ago to understand the barometerand with my remembering it nowthen he bid me try to find out the particularuse of this portable barometer and did you harry yes but i was helped my fatherwho was present put me in the rightroad i was very stupid at first myhead went quite off the wrong way butmy father was very patient and broughtit back again and set it upon the rightroad still i was very slow my unclethought i should never find it out hesaid it was too difficult and that my fatherhad better tell rne but papa saidhe was almost sure that i should find itout myself this encouraged me and itried and thought again and my uncleleft off walking up and down the roomfretting he was so good as to be patienttoo that was kind of him said lucy i know it is very difficult to be patientwith people if they are slow infinding a thing out when one knows itall the time one longs to tell or topush them on to itpapa did not push me said harrythat would have thrown me down buthe pulled he helped me on gently stepby step as he does so nicely and he letme find it out at last quite by myselfwell then you can do the same formeharryi will try said harry thank you but first let me tell youall that i have been saying to mamma andall that mamma has said to meshe repeated it all as well as she couldending with mamma tells me that imay go on with you harry as we usedto do and she said she thought thatyou would be so kind as to bring me uptoyou in all you have been learningi will try said harryi hope i shall not be very stupidsaid lucyno no lucy dare say you willnot do not begin by thinking you willthat is a very bad way because thenyou go on thinking you are afraid youwill be stupid instead of attending towhat is asked and said to you nowlucy suppose you were at the bottomof a deep wellif i were at the bottom of a wellthen i should find out the truth becauseyou know the common proverb as mrcranbourne said that truth is at the bottomof a wellnonsense my dear lucy cried harrynow if you go to your wit and whatmr cranbourne says i cannot attemptto talk to you about the barometerwell i will be very attentive saidlucy suppose then i was at thebottom of a well but should not i bedrowned added she in a low voicevery true i should not have said thebottom of a well but the bottom of a deeppit said harryoh that is another affair said lucyi like that better now then i am atthe bottom of a deep pitnow then which do you think wouldweigh the heaviest the air at the bottomof this pit or the air at the top of a highhousei think it would weigh heaviest atthe bottom of the pit said lucywhy asked harryoh my dear such an easy questionsaid lucywell answer it at any rate saidharry because in the bottom of the pitthe air in the pit is added to the air thatis above the pit and also you must addall the air that reaches to the top of thehouse i believe you understand it supposeyou took this barometer to the bottom ofthe pit do you think that the mercurywould rise or fall my dear lucy praythink before you answerlucy thought and answered i thinkit would rise at the bottom of the pit right now if you took it to the topof a high house would it rise or falli think it would fall replied lucywhy said harrybecause then there would be lessweight pressing upon the quicksilver inthe cup and therefore less quicksilverwould be pressed up into the tubevery well indeed lucy i see youremember all papa taught us about thebarometer now suppose the pit wassixty feet deep and that the house wasforty feet high forty and sixty make ahundred you knowto be sure said lucy well well said harry i must goslowly suppose that you observe exactlyhow much the quicksilver falls when youtake it from the bottom of the pit to thetop of the house you would have a measureby which you could judge of thewhole height and depthi see i should said lucy i see ii see the use of your barometer and it isvery usefulbut you do not see all yet saidharry by marking this you would notonly know how much the quicksilver fallsin that hundred feet but by dividing itand making a scale you might know thesame thing afterwards in any number offeet in any height to which you mighttake the barometer and by this youwould have an easy way of measuringthe height of mountainsvery ingenious very convenient said lucy now i understand the useof your portable barometer perfectlynot perfectly said harry thereis a great deal more to be learned aboutheat at different heights and rarefactionof the air but i will not puzzle youwith that especially as i am not clearabout it yet myself but this is thegeneral notion which papa says is quitenough at firstquite enough for me said lucythank you harry for telling me nomorei wish oh how i wish criedharry that we had a mountain to measurewith my portable barometer but said lucy a mountain wnot come to you for wishing for it anymorethan to mahometmahomet repeated harry whatdo you meando not you know harry the commonsaying since the mountain willnot come to mahomet mahomet mustgo to the mountain you were byharry when i read this in our universalhistory to mamma do not you rememberitno i forget it how much betteryou lucy remember some sorts of thingsthan i doand how much worse i understandother sorts of things than you do thereforeas mamma says we can help oneanother and then in time we shall knowtwice as much between us my dearharry how convenient that will be andhow happy we shall bevery happy but we cannot be alwaystogether said harry so we mustlearn to remember what we want for ourselvesor it will be rather inconvenientwhen we are separatewe shall not be separated for a greatwhile said lucy papa said yesterdayto mamma i heard him that you are notto go to school yet i am very glad of that said harryfor i shall be so happy going on at homelearning from my father and with youlucy but my dear to go back to mahometfor i do not like to let that gowithout in the least understanding whatit meansnever mind only a bit of wit saidlucy but cannot you explain it to mesaid harryno it is so easy that if you do notsee it at first i cannot make it plainersaid lucydo try said harryit means only that mahomet wasfoolish for commanding the mountain inabraggadocio way to come to him andwhen all the people standing by expectedperhaps that the mountain should obeyhim and come at his bidding and whenit did not stir he came off in a shabbyway by saying that since the mountaindid not come to him he must go to themountainais that all said harry but youtold me it was a common sayingyes afterwards it came to be a comvol i cmon saying whenever a person proposessomething which seems fine and grandand which they cannot really do andwhen they come off with doing somethingcommon and easy then comes thesaying about mahomet and the mountainthank you said harry in a tone asif he had said thank you for nothingbut still i do not understand how thisapplied to my wishing for a mountain tomeasure with my portable barometeroh my dear harry do not be sograve about it said lucyi only look grave because i am tryingto understand said harry how thestory appliedi suppose it did not apply as youcall it said lucy after considering for afew moments but do not let us talkany more of itonly tell me how it came into yourhead said harryi cannot tell said lucy when yousaid something about wishing the mountainwould come to you no no interrupted harry thatwas not what i said exactlywell never mind exactly about sucha thing as this my dear harry saidlucy i only know that whatever it wasthat you said the sound of the wordsabout mountain brought the mountainand mahomet into my headthe sound of the words said harry so after all the words only camejingling into your head from the soundand had nothing to do with the business and i have been all this while trying tomake sense of nonsensei told you it was nonsense at firstsaid lucyyou told me it was wit said harrywell my dear if one tries to explainwit it often turns into nonsense then what great good is there inwit if you understand it at first it is verydiverting that is good said lucycbut if i cannot understand it at firstsaid harrywhy then i cannot help it saidlucy that is rather provoking said harry more provoking for me said lucythis time i have been trying and tryingto explain but in explaining the witis lost the pleasure at least is all gonebut that was not my fault saidharryyes but it was my dear for notunderstanding it at firstthat is the same thing you said beforemy dear lucybecause it is the truth my dear andi have nothing else to say harryand i have only to make the sameanswer i made before lucy that if icannot understand it i cannotand i come round again to i cannothelp it harry that is arguing in a circle as papasays observed harryi do not know what is meant byarguing in a circle said lucy supposeit is something in euclidno my dear euclid never argues inacircle he only argues about a circle orcirclesii and about said lucy oh letus say no more about it i hate sayingso much about one thingi like to stick to one thing till i understandit said harrybut when you can't said lucy you really are so slow harry aboutwitperhaps i am a little slow saidharry but recollect lucy that youacknowledged yourself at last that thestory did not apply so how could i understanditwell i acknowledge said lucy but that excuse will do only for thisoncei dare say i shall find another nexttime said harry but now looklucy at those two men carrying thatlong ladder across the lawn what arethey going to do with it i want to know they were going to carry it to a churchin the village the steeple of which wantedsome repair his father followed the menand harry asked if lucy and he mightgo with him his father gave him leaveand harry carried his portable barometerwith him saying that he thought he couldtry it at the top of the churchin the church there were stairs whichled up to the gallery but there was nowayof going up to the top of the towerbut by means of a ladder the menfixed it steadily and harry's father wentup harry wanted to follow but his fathersaid he must not come yet because hehad not time to think of him till theirbusiness was finished my dear harry said lucy i thinkit is very dangerous you will never beable to go to such a height i am almostafraid to look at papa going up it makesmy head giddyand when his father called him sheheld the flap of his coat and said indeedharry you had better give it up give it up no that he would nothe began to run up the ladder withhe barometer in his hand but his fathercalled to him and bid him stop and orderedhim to give the barometer to oneof the masons who was behind him whomhe requested to carry it for him and tofollow him up the ladderoh papa i am used you know tomounting ladders and i am safe withoutany body to take care of raedo as you are desired or you shallnot come up at all said his fatherharry obeyed and when he got highup on the ladder he felt that his fatherwas right for though he had been usedto go up ladders he had never gone upone that was nearly so high he felt anunusual sensation of giddiness in his headhe was glad the man was close behindhim he held fast to the sides of the ladderstepped up very carefully and seizedhis father's hand who was waiting forhim at the top when landed safely onthe roof of the tower he looked abouthim when he looked down his head stillfelt a little giddy and it was some momentsbefore he recovered himself sufficientlyto think even of his portable barometerthen he recollected that in hishurry to come up he had forgotten to markhow high the mercury stood when he wason the ground he did not like thethoughts of immediately going down theladder again it occurred to him that itwould do exactly as well to mark theheight at which the quicksilver now stoodat the top of the tower and afterwards tosee how much it would rise when he gotto the bottom but lucy had his penciland paper below he wrote the figureson a bit of slate which one of the men hadin his hand after being a little used toithe grew quite at ease at this heightand could think as well as when on thefirm ground when he was to go downthe ladder he was a little startled by hearinglucy cry out oh harry takecarehis father stopped him told lucy shewas very foolish to call out desired herto go into the church and wait there tillthey should come which she did andvery glad she was when she saw harryand her father come down safelyupon examining the bit of slate onwhich he had written his figures andwhich he had put into his bosom whilehe came down the ladder he found thatthey were so rubbed that it was impossibleto make them outlucy who was afraid of his going upagain was by turns sure that one figurewas an eight a nine or a noughtthis would not do for harry he mustgo up again his father said he wasright and this time he wrote down whatthe barometer was before he went up andcarried paper and pencil with him hisfather was so good as to accompany himit was all done rightly and this time lucydid not say a word till harry's foot wasc off the last rung of the ladder and safe onthe groundnow they knew exactly how much thequicksilver had fallen in going up to thetop of the tower and at what it had stoodat the bottom harry said that this mustbe compared with a table of measureswhich he had at home which would tellthe height in feet and inchesand here be it noted that on thisand many other occasions lucy's readinessin arithmetic was of use to her brotherwhen he came to his calculations thehabit of writing her figures exactly underneatheach other in the right rows andof drawing straight lines and making neatlittle figures all proved of advantage whenshe was called upon to write down totalsfor him in a great hurry or to go overand copy clearly his scrawled sums inaddition multiplication subtraction anddivisionon the present occasion difficulties occurredand lucy sat beside harry for aquarter of an hour writing down and rubbingout figures upon a slate and complyingby turns with contrary orderslucy my dear write down andsubtract it from have you done itstay a bit presently yesmy dear i meant to say add did say subtract no add addswell i have addednow multiply that by no stay first it must be divided stop i do notunderstand this table there is somethingabout height above the level of the seahere that i cannot make out then whatis this about expansion continued hereading oh my dear lucy we areall wrong i do not know how to allowfor the thermometer and here is a calculationabout expansion and proportionand heaven knows what oh it is allwrongs i do not know what i am aboutthis lucy had suspected but she hadthe good nature not to say so and asall she had done was right she found iteasy to be patient harry ran to lookfor the article ore barometer no barometerportable in a cyclopedia butthere opened to harry's eyes such a quartoscene of tables and fractions and algebraicsigns as quite dismayed hiniandlucy stood in stupefied silence beside himat length he observedthere is a great difference betweenhaving a general notion of any thing andknovsing it thoroughly i thought i understoodthe use of this barometer perfectlybut when i come to try i cannot make itout wellit is too difficult said lucy youwill only puzzle yourself she offeredto shut the bookno no will try and puzzle it outand when papa comes in he will helpme and show me my mistakewhen his father came in he did helpharry and with his assistance and patienceit was all made clearbut after all said lucy thoughyou have found out the height of thechurch it was a difficult way of doingit with all these calculations would notit have been easier to have measured itby letting down from the top a string anda freight a plumb line as it is called i believesthen you could have measured thestring and you would have had no difficultyvery true said harry that wouldhave been the easiest way in this instancebecause we could get to the top of thechurch at once and let down a plumbline but consider lucy when we want tomeasure high crooked mountains mileshigh with ins and outs and ups anddowns how difficult that would be besidesthis puzzle with the portable barometerwould not plague me again it wasonly because it was my first time of trial and i am glad that we have conqueredthe difficultyit is very good of you to say we fori did nothing but write down the figuresand do the sums said lucybut that helped me very much andthank you for doing it so patiently youdid not yawn above six times and nowmy dear lucy if we had but a mountainto measure how happy we should be going tothe top of it together at any rate saidlucylccy your hair is hanging into youreyes this morning said her motheryes mother said lucy becauseit is quite out of curl did you curl it last night lucy said her motheryes mamma i did indeed and itcurled very nicely this morning early but i went out in hopes of meeting myuncle who was to have come to breakfast and by the time that i came inagain my hair was all as you see thebreakfast bell rang and i had not time tocurl it againher mother was satisfied since lucyhad not neglected to curl it at nightwhich had sometimes been the case herfather asked if she knew what had uncurledher hair when she went out the damp of the morning papasaid she my hair always goes out ofcurl in damp weatherso does mine lucy said her mother it is not peculiar to your hair togo out of curl in damp weather but lucy what do you mean by yourhair going out of curl said her fatherjust what you see papa that it hangsstraight you told me the moisture of the morninguncurled it do you know how or whyit does so said her fatherno papa not in the least i wishyou would tell me when your hair is curled the partsof one side of each hair are pressed closetogether and the parts on the other sideare stretched out give me that piece ofpackthreadit was loosely twisted he coiled upa bit of it and showed her that in theinner circle the parts are pressed togetherand in the outer they are stretchednow i see said lucy and youmean that it is just the same with myhair when i curl it but still i do notunderstand how the damp straightens itthat you shall see directly said herfather and he dipped the curled packthreadinto a cup of water when it wasall wet it became straightyes it has uncurled like my hairsaid lucy but how look and you will see that the waterhas filled all the interstices or vacancieswhich you observed between the differentparts of the cord now there are in yourhair and in all hair pores or small vacancieswhich can be filled with moisturelike the interstices in this packthread andwhich imbibe moisture from the air asthis packthread imbibed the water andyou see it filled the pores on the insideas well as on the outsidethank you papa said lucy thatis very nice to know why my hair uncurlsis at least a comfort now i understandit allnot all said her father there isa property of hair which you do not yetknow that when it is wet that is whenits pores are filled with moisture i see papa you mean it swells outand becomes thicker like this cordnot exactly like that cord lucy thatcord shortens as it swells out in breadth but hair lengthens when it is moist allhuman hair is easily affected by moisturevery easily indeed said lucy dividingher uncurled locks on her foreheadand trying to put them out of her wayi was not in the damp above ten minutesand yet you see how straight myhair has become indeed papa as yousay human hair is very easily affected bymoisture'yes fortunately said harryfortunately repeated lucy unfortunatelyyou mean why do you sayfortunately i have a reason and a good onesaid harry it is fortunate that hair hasthat property for one reason for onepurpose useful to all men and women butespecially to men of sciencefortunate and useful said lucybrother how can it possibly be fortunateor useful to you or to men ofscience in particular or to any body thatmy hair should so easily go out of curl indamp weathernot your hair in particular lucybut hair in general said harrywhat use said lucy if everybody'shair in the whole world was togo out of curl like this every damp day what use could it be but to make them alllook very deplorable as mamma says ido when my hair is in this conditionwhat good would this do to men ofscience or any men you do not understand me saidharry smiling did you never hear ofan hygrometerhygrometer said lucy eyes ihave often heard of an hygrometer iheard papa talking to you about hygrometersvery lately and reading a great deallast wednesday no last thursday no matter my dear interrupted herfather what day you heard me readingabout it do you know or do you notknow what an hygrometer islucy confessed she did not knowexactly what it was but she thought ithad something to do with a barometerand a thermometer because it ends inmeter and she remembered long agoher father had told her that meter meantmeasure and comes from some greekword that means to measure thereforeshe supposed an hygrometer must be amachine or an instrument for measuringsomething but what she did not know she guessed it was something about theairher father said that she was so farright in thinking that it is an instrumentused to measure something he told herthat it measures moisture in the air andthat the name hygrometer is composed oftwo greek words hugros moist or moistureand matron measurelucy liked this name which containsas she observed the history of the thing and now she knew this she thought shecould never forget ittheir uncle had not yet come in tobreakfast and their father beginning toread the newspaper to their motherharry and lucy went on at the fartherend of the room talking to each othernow you can guess said harrywhy i said that it was very lucky thatyour hair uncurls so easily in the dampyou observed yourself that you couldalways know by your hair whether it isa damp day or not whether air is moistor notso hair is an hygrometer said lucy for it measures moisture i am sure myhair might say if it could speak greekhygrometer or in plain english inoisti measuresvery true said harry but stillyou do not know the measure exactly ofhow moist how damp the day may be do you yes on very very damp days myhair comes quite out of curl as you seeit now said lucy and hangs quitestraight but it only comes a little outof curl on days that are only a little dampor dampwisha little damp dampish repeatedharry that is very well forcommon talking but it does not describeexactly how damp i do not know whatdegree of moisture you mean to expressby dampipish echoed lucy harry wouldnot smileyou have not yet told me lucysaid he gravely how the hygrometeris made to show the measure of moistureexactlyi do not know exactly brother butsuppose for instance you knew how longmy hair is when it is quite dry then indamp weather when it is moist and hangsstraight you could measure how long ithas grown i mean how much it haslengthened by the dampi could measure said harry buthow you could see whether my hair comesdown as far as to my eyebrows or onlythis far or this far said lucy touchingdifferent points on her forehead if ihad a lookingglass i would measure thisfor myselfthis might do said harry but atbest it would do only for yourself andbut badly for yourself because you mustto mark your points have disagreeablespots on your forehead always should not like that said lucynor would mamma i am surebesides continued harry itwould be rather inconvenient to me torun in search of you with a pair ofcompasses and my ruler to measure yourhair and your scale on your foreheadthis would be rather an inconvenienthygrometerrather i acknowledge said lucyyou would twitch all the hair off myhead too in measuring each hair i suppose and i should be afraid that youwould put out my eyes with the pointsof your compasses when you came tomeasure the scale on my forehead ishould not like to be your hygrometeri would much rather have one thatwould always stand or hang in my roomsaid harry or one that i could carryabout in my pocket better still couldyou manage that for me could youfind out how to do that i found outhow to do itdid you indeed brother and do youthink i canyes if you think well and if yougo on thinking said harry i will then but tell me exactly whati am to think about and what is to bedone said lucyharry pulled a hair out of his ownhead and laid it on a piece of whitepaper before her there said hestretching it out you see its length wewill suppose this hair is as dry as it canbe now i will dip it into this bason ofwater now that it has been wet it islonger than it was when it was dryyes but we want to know how muchlonger said lucy well it is easy tolay it on this sheet of paper and measureas exactly as you please how muchlonger it is when it is wet than it waswhen it was quite dryvery well said harry and i cantell you that you would find it to be onefortieth of its length longer then youhave the utmost lenoth between extrememoisture and extreme drynessand continued lucy i coulddivide this line on the paper between thetwo black dots by which you marked thepoints to which it stretched when it wasdry and when it was damp and if dividedexactly it would be what you callascale you could measure how muchin different degrees of damp or dry itstretches or shortensvery well indeed said harry andthe scale on paper would be better than onyour forehead you see that's one pointfixedthat's one point gained said lucynow what is to be done nextnext you are to find out how withoutthe trouble of continually pluckinghairs out of my head or yours and wettingor drying and measuring them you mightknow every day or hour or at any timeyou please how damp the air is or howmuch moisture it contains if i could but make the hair measureitself said lucy and mark or showhow far it shrinks or lengthens on thispaper in any timeaye if you could said harry thatis the questionsuppose i had a very very very littleweight said lucy so little that thishair could support it without breakingthen i could tie it to one end of the hairand hang the hair by the other end tosomething suppose a piece of wire stuckinto the wall and i would put this papervol dwith our scale upon it against the walljust behind the weight and when you lookat it you would see how much the hairhad shrunk or lengthened at any time indamp or drythere papa cried harry lucyhas made out as far as i did the firsttime i thought of making an hygrometer lucy looked much pleased with herselfand with her brother for being pleased withherand have i really invented an hygrometerharry cried sheyes but not a perfect one my dearsaid harry there is a great deal moreto be donewhat more said lucy to come to breakfast in the first placesaid her fatherthis lucy was ready to do for she wasa little tired but by the time she hadrefreshed herself by eating half her breakfastshe returned to the question what more is to be done brother aboutthe hygrometer to make it more convenient saidharry in your way it must always bestuck up against a wall and besidesyour divisions are so very very smallthat you can hardly see how much thehair lengthens or shortensyou might take a magnifying glasssaid lucywell that would help but cannotyou think of another way lucy thought for a little while and wenton eating her breakfast and presently answered no brother i can think onlyof taking a larger magnifying glass a glassthat magnifies more will that dostill there is an easier method putthe magnifying glass out of your headit must be a more difficult instead ofan easier way for i cannot find it outsaid lucybut it is easier i assure you whenyou have found it out said harrycome i will help you a little continuedhe after she had considered forsome time look at the hand of thatd of clock and he pointed to the dialplate ofa pendule which was on the chimneypieceopposite to the breakfasttablelook the hand now points at ten doyou see how far it is from ten to eleven suppose that hand was to move frolten to eleven well suppose said lucy i caneasily suppose this then which would have moved thefarthest which would have gone over themost space the point of the hand whichis at the outside of the dialplate or thatpart of the hand which is closest to thecentre the point of the hand which is at theoutermost part of the circle would havegone the farthest i mean would havemoved over the most space the partnearest to the centre would have movedso little that i suppose i should hardlybe able to see or measure by my eye howmuch true said harry you could notbut you could see and you could measurethe space from ten to eleven easily couldnot youcertainly said lucyyou could guess the measure even byyour eye without taking compasses ormagnifying glass said harry now i see what you are about saidlucy i must have a little beetle handand dial plate for my hygrometer toshow and to measure the least motion ofthe hair in shortening or lengtheningright said harry so far rightdo not tell me any more said lucy i can do it all for myself now and in aminutedo not be in such a hurry my dearsaid harry or you will never do ithurry i am not in the least hurrysaid lucy only i like to be quickwell i would fasten the end of the hair tothe axle so as to make every the smallestmotion of the hair move the handshe paused she was not quite clearof the manner in which this was to bedonei will help you said harry suppose suppose said his mother that youwere to let lucy finish her breakfasti will and welcome said harry for now she has the principle of an hygrometerwhich papa was explaining tomethe other day and of which i willshow her a plate after breakfastplate said lucy i may as wellhave the plate at breakfast may not i by a plate i mean an engravingsaid harry did not you know that oh yes to be sure said lucy i was only in playbreakfast finished harry went to thelibrary to look for the book and lucyfollowed eager to see the drawing anddescription of what she had been tryingto invent he showed her in trees's cyclopediatwo engravings of different hygrometersthis said he pointing to one wasinvented by a great english engineer ofthe name of smeaton and this other bymonsieur de saussure the famous swisstraveller yours lucy my dear is notexactly either of these it is most likesmeaton's but he uses a cord with aweight hung to it instead of a hair itis said however that a hair is better thanacord for our purposeand how does the other man m desaussure manage with the hair saidlucyharry pointed to the engraving andshowed her that one end of the hair isfastened as she had proposed to the axleof the hand and the hair wound roundthe axle but the other end instead ofhaving a weight hung to it is strainedtight and fastened to a frame of woodbelow then when the hair shortens orlengthens with dryness oi moisture itturns the axle of the hand a lite or muchaccording to the shortening of the hairturns the axle of the hand repeatedlucy i see it would turn when thehair shortens because that would pull itround but i do not see how when thehair lengthens that it would turn back theaxle and the hand i think that the hairwould only loosen round the axletrue lucy and accurate cried harrywith pleasure in his eyes but lookagain at this engraving see here a weighthanging to this little cord which is woundround the axle in a contrary direction tothe hair the weight is just enough tokeep the hair constantly strained so as toprevent it from loosening as you rightlysaid it would round the axle if there wasnot any thing to prevent it when the hairlengthens from moisture then as itis kept stretched it turns the axle andhandyes now i see no difficulty saidlucy i understand it quite and i amglad i told you the difficulty for youhave cleared it away i hate to feel thati have only half understood and to leaveoff in a puzzle but harry here areprints of a great many more hygrometersyes made of different substancessaid harry many things beside hairyou know can be used to show thechanges of moisture and dryness allthings which show these easily some ofthem we have observed ourselves oftenoh yes said lucy salt and sugarfor instance and some kinds of woodwhich warp with the changes of the weatherfrom wet to dry the wood of thiswindow frame i remember was swelledso much during the rain last week thatwe could not open the sashyes that sash is made of deal thewood of fir tree you know said harryand this sort of wood shrinks and expandsquickly with dryness and moisturei recollect interrupted lucy iread something about a creeping woodenhygrometer in the notes to the botanicgarden my dear i remember it perfectlybecause it was entertaining there was awooden automaton a machine that movedof itselfi know of no such machine interrusted harry if it moved it must havebeen moved by some cause well the damp i suppose was thecause now let me go on harry it wasa wooden automaton with a long backand four feet with ironpointed shoeswhich clawed on little by little so that itwalked or crept or clawed quite acrossthe floor of its master's room in a month'stime from the changes of damp and dryi do not know how but it was very entertainingand it will entertain me now muchmore if you can show me how it was contrivedthere was i remember somethingabout pflueino the bits of wood thatmade the back i do not rightly knowhow said lucy crosswayscrossgrain i suppose you meansaid harry we will look for it by andby and i will try if i can understand andexplain it to you but now go on andguess some other substances of which hygrometersare made i do not recollect any more help mealittle said lucyharry pointed to his mother's harpi see mamma's harp said lucy butthat only puts me in mind of the last tuneshe playeddo not you recollect that a stringbroke yesterdayyes i do and how troublesome itwas said lucy i remember thatmrs stay now do not go to mrs anybodybut think of the cause of that stringbreakingmamma said that it was cracked bvthe sudden change of the weatherwhat change from dry to damp i believe saidlucy oh now i understand it and iknow what you mean in damp weatherthe moisture from the air gets into thestrings and swells them out and so shortensthem that if they are held tight at eachend they crack those strings are madeof catgut catgut then would be a goodthing for an hygrometeryes said harry but now i willtell you another thing used for hygrometerswhich i do not think you could guessivoryivory no i never should have thoughtof that said lucy i never knew thativory lengthens and shortens in damp ordry weather it does though said harry thereare a great many pores in ivory we cannotsee them without a magnifying glass butthe moisture gets into these pores andswells it out but now lucy there is anothercommon thing which you see everydaywhich you might guess when youdip it in water you may see its great poresswelling without any magnifying glassand then when you squeeze the water outand dry it it shrinks so that you couldhold in your shut hand what when fullof water was as large as my heada spunge a spunge cried lucybut if a spunge is left in a room byitself would it suck up water from theairyes whether it is left in a room byitself or not said harry it will absorbdo not say suck up moisture from the air and it grows heavier when it is fillingmoisture or lighter as it dries thespunge hygrometer is measured or measuresby weight not by lengthening orshortening expanding or contractingyou do not look as if you understandthis lucyi do said lucy but i am growingtired i think i have had enoughabout hygrometersno no you cannot be tired so soon guess once more said harry youmay easily guess this because it is a thingused in your dresslucy had observed she said that hergloves often grew damp in wet weathershe guessed leather it was not whatharry meant but he said that he thoughtleather would do and he did not knowwhy it had not been used perhaps as ittakes in moisture so easily it may not expandor contract equallyencouraged by harry's approbation ofher good guess of leather lucy was willingto try and guess again but help mes'said sheharry told her that the thing he meantis stiff and yet not so stiff but that it canbe bent it is springy and elasticshe thought of several things which canbe bent but she could not guess rightand then yawning and stretching herselfshe repeated that she was tired and thatshe could not guess any more harrymust tell herthen i will tell you whalebone mydear come have done yawning saidharry i will not make you guess anymore now i will show you somethingentertaining i will show you a nice littlehygrometer made of an arabian oatsbeardshow it me said lucy stopping inthe midst of a full stretch here in this print said harryonly a print i thought you had thereal beard said lucyyou might make an hygrometer yourselfi dare say of a common english oatbeard said harrywell that i should like said lucy you were right after all harry whenyou said it was lucky that my hair uncurledso easily how odd it is harrythat i have been carrying all my life onmy head without ever thinking of it tillthis morning one of the best of hygrometers my having an hygrometer withoutknowing it is like the man who talkedprose all his life without knowing iti do not know what man you meansaid harry come now look at it thisarabian oat hygrometer lucy it is thegreat doctor hook's i do not care about the great doctorhook said lucy but let me tell youabout the man who talked prose withoutknowing it he was a man in a play avery entertaining play papa was readingone evening when you were not listeningthere was a maidservant teachings herold master his letters and asking himwhat he does when he says the letter unow you shall be the old man and iwill be the maid and i will teach yousay unonsense my dear said harrynot at all nonsense said lucy you may ask papawell but i have not time now saidharryand the maid taught him to fencecontinued lucy if i had but a stick iwould show younow your head is gone quite off tothe play i shall have no more good ofyou said harry looking mournfullybut here comes my uncle continuedhe as his uncle at this moment enteredthe room uncle will you look at thishygrometer for mei will harry with pleasure said hisobliging uncleand so will i harry said lucy tooblige you my head is come back fromthe play nowfor about three minutes she was attentiveand she understood and admired toharry's hearts content the arabian oathygrometerthen now lucy i will show you amuch better cried harry one which ismade of a kind of indian grass which grassis extremely sensibleextremely sensible grass interruptedlucy laughing uncle i never heardof extremely sensible grass before didyoui think iou are not extremely sensiblenow my little niece said her uncle tobegin punning instead of minding whatyour brother is telling you surely youknow that sensible means sensitive that ishaving quick or great sensibility youknow these words are applied to plantsfor you have heard of the sensitive plantoh yes to be sure uncle saidlucy i was only playing i know thetwo meanings of the word sensible as wellas any body and i have not only heardof the sensitive plant but seen it at auntpierrepoint's and not only seen it andits leaves closing up and shrinking backfrom my touch but what is more uncle ihave learned by heart dr darwin's lines onthe sensitive plant the mimosashe repeated them and her uncle saidthat they were pretty lines and that sherepeated them welland would not they make a goodmotto for an hygrometer uncle saidshe very good said her uncle and now resumed harry let meshow you this hygrometerone other motto my dear uncle ihave thought of for the barometer continuedlucy without considering howmuch she was trying her brother's patienceshe went on repeating while sheheld her uncle by the flap of his coatyou charmed indulgent sylphs their learned toiland crown'd with fame your torricel and boylea torricel cried harry i supposeyou mean torricelli no it is torricel in the lines i assureyou said lucy it is torricelli out of the lines i assureyou said harry there never wassuch a man as torricel was there uncletheir uncle whispered to lucy thatharry was rightwell never miid it must be torricelhere for the sake of the line said lucyelse it would be too long let me oroon i will tell you what the indulgentsylphs taught these people she wenton repeating beautiful lines lucy said her uncle but i am sure you cannot understandthem as you are not yet acquainted withthe air pumpbut harry is said lucy and he willexplain it to me will not you harryharry looked very serious sighed andsaid nothingwhy do you sigh harrybecause said her uncle he is afraidthat he shall never be able to make youunderstand the air pump or any thingelse if you are not more attentiveharry i beg your pardon said lucybut you know i was very attentive atfirstand will be very attentive at last ihope said her uncle come we willboth be serious added he sitting downat the table and drawing lucy towardshim he seated her on half his chair putone arm round her and leaned his otheron the table in an attitude of attentionnow harry explain your hygrometerand spare the remains of that poor penbut lucy looks tired said harryhave you a mind to see the hygrometeror not i have a little mind said lucy thatis i have a great mind to please youbrother only we need not go throughthem all said she as he placed the platesbefore herno do not be frightened said harry i am not going to show them all to you i am going to show you only the verybeststay said his uncle putting his handoverthe engraving to which harry waspointing do not show her that showher any other she must not yet see thatwhy not i wonder why said lucyi have a reason said her unclebut never mind or think about thatwhich i hide under my hand my dearattend to what your brother is going toshow youwhich shall i show her uncle saidharry shall i show her de luc's ivoryor whalebone hygrometerthe whalebone for that is the mostsimple i think replied his uncleharry with the article hygrometer beforehim began look here lucy do you see little and little b this represents a small thinbit of whalebone cut across the grain youknow what is meant by the grain of thewhalebone but do you see little a andlittleno lucy instead of looking at littlea b was peeping at the back of thepage and reading something about a littleman and a little woman and a weatherglasshere is something very entertainingbrother said she i must read it to you in the dutch toys called weather glassesone end of the index supports a smallimage of a man and the other of a womanthe former appears or is brought out inbad weather the latter in fair weatheri remember said lucy that onceat our widow green's farm i saw a weatherglass of this sort but i was not thenwise enough to know that it was calledan hygrometerthere is no great wisdom in knowingthat names said her uncle i wish you would show me how tomake this thing brother said lucy thatwould be something indeedi can answered harry and i willanother day lucy but i can show youbut one thing at a time now pray mindwhat you are about because i have otherthings to doyes lucy consider your brother'stime said her uncle he wants to gotohis own affairs pray mind what youare abouti will i will indeed uncle i willharry cried lucyharry began again withlittle z is a thin piece of whalebonecut across the grain he wasgoing on with his explanation and wentthrough c d and e confident that lucywas following him but by that time heheard the sound of an illsuppressed laughand looking up he saw lucy with bothher hands pressed against her mouth toprevent her laughter from bursting forthwhat can you be laughing at lucysaid heonly at the odd figures of the littleold man and woman in the weather glasswhich i never can think of without laughing the woman with her cap and redribbons all awry and her eyes crookedtoo and her arm akimbo and her pipe inher mouth doubled back against her snubnose flattening it this way look harrylook uncle her uncle instead of joining in lucy'smerriment said gravely that she was wrongto waste her brother's time and that hewas afraid she would never learn any thingof science if she were not more attentiveher mother came into the room whileher uncle was speaking and lucy lookedashamed and mortified writhing as if withbodily pain she said i did attend aslong as ever i could but i could not anylonger i was so shockingly tiredit was my fault said harry ikept you too long and told you too muchat a time but i did that because you toldme you wanted to get on and to learn alli had learned as quickly as possiblethat is true said lucy i waswrong there i confessand since we are all confessing saidher uncle i suppose i should confess iwas wrong in praising you lucy for repeatingthose lines yes indeed my dear uncle i thinkyou were said lucy for that encouragedme to repeat more though i knewmy brother did not like that i should i was wrong i suppose not to likeit said harry but i will try to likepoetry betterand i will not repeat it at the wrongtime said lucy but harry anotherday you must not tell me such a quantityand keep me so long at it i will not said harry i know itwas wrong but i was so eager and happymyself and besides you said you wantedto get on fastwell but will be content to go alittle slower and not to do so much atonce right my dear lucy said her uncle the only way to be quick at last inscience at least is to be content to goslowly at firstyou may remember lucy said hermother that was the way you began inarithmetic you used to tell me every dayvol i emamma this is very slow work butnow you can go on with it quicklya great deal more quickly than i cani am sure said harrywell harry i will be as slow as youplease in scientific things said lucyand i will never tire you again sosadly said harry if i can help iti will never be tired again said lucyif i can help it if i can help it repeated their mother is a wise and safe additionthe next day harry and lucy havingfinished their morning's business wereanxious to return to the hygrometer andto try their resolution of mutual forbearancebut they had taken no exercisethis day their uncle advised them torun out to their gardens and divert themselvesfor an hour or tworemember said he aesop's goodold fable and excellent principle of unbendingthe bowtjyes said lucy the strings of mamma'sharp never crack when she remembersto let them down to loosen them intimeafter having refreshed themselves banhour of that voluntary hard bodilywork which children of all aoes aoreeto call play and after they had rested andcooled themselves while they gathered abasket full of their own strawberries ofwhich of course they ate a proper proportionto determine whether they were orwere not ripe they returned to the houseintending to offer these their first strawberriesto their uncle but not in thelibrary nor in the breakfast room senorup the lawn nor at the wood was he and it was concluded that he was gonehome to his own house which was abouta quarter of a mile's walk from theirswe had better run after him with ourbasket said lucyno he will come back before dinneri am sure said harry for mamma saidhe was to dine here and there is his greate coat still in the hall now let us go to thehygrometerlucy set down her basket of strawberriesat the farthest end of the roomlest the smell should disturb her andharry took down and opened his largevolume but their hands were in no conditionto touch delicate engravings hiswere brown with garden mould and herspink with the juice of strawberries thedressing bell had rung and their motherstrongly advised their dressing before theybegan to readthis advice to dress firsts and then youare ready to do whatever you please afterwardsso often given by age to youthand so seldom taken or well taken wasin this instance acted upon instantly withoutone murmur of the tongue or onewrithing of the bodyin all the selfcomplacency and safetyof being ready half an hour before dinnertime they met again in the library wherethey found their uncleoh uncle i am glad you are herescried lucy and after presenting to himtheir strawberries they went to their bookharry asked whether he should go onwith old whakhojie or notgo on with old whalebone said hisuncle lucy should not leave thatwithout understandings it not that it signifieswhether she understands that particularthing or not but this will be a trialof her attentioni well be very attentive said lucybut observing that her uncle placedhis arm as before so as to cover one ofthe hygrometers in the engraving her curiositya little disturbed her her uncleremarking the turn of her eye said i advise you lucy to repress yourcuriosity do not think of what is undermy elbow but of what sour brother isshowing youlucy repressed her curiosity and commandedher attention harry explainedslowly and she followed step by steppatiently undisturbed by the fear of beingtoo slow or the hope of showing that liewas very quick and without one glanceat her uncle's arm or one thought ofwhat might be his reason for keeping itin that position she went regularly throughthe a h c r of de luc's whalebone hygrometerand understood it to her ownand to her brother's complete satisfactionher uncle was as he said glad to perceivethat lucy had so far kept her resolution and he told her that if she steadilywent on in the same manner she wouldfind it in time easy to do what she nowfelt so difficult to fix her attentionand now said he removing his armfrom the print you shall know myreason for covering this and i will showyou what i went home forhe took from his pocket and placedbetween harry and lucy a small cylindricalcase of about three inches highcovered with morocco leather it is like the case of mamma's operaglass cried lucy is there an operaglass in it no harry smiled for he knew whatwas in it immediately le knew that itwas his favourite hygrometer his uncletook it out of the case and placed it besidethe engraving which he had coveredwith his arm telling lucy that he hadwished only to delay showing her theengraving till she could compare it withthe original which he had walked hometo bring for them it was so simple thatupon looking at it and examining theplate lucy understood it directly it iscomposed of a kind of indian grasswhich like the beard of the arabian andof the english oat twists and untwistswith dryness or moisture but in a muchgreater degree making it is said fromten to sixteen revolutions from the extremeof moisture to the extreme of drynessharry told lucy that in thedescription which he had read of thishygrometer it is said that it shows moreeasily and quickly than any other thechanges of moisture in the atmosphere it is so sensible continued harryas to be affected by the shutting andopening of a door or window and issure to feel the approach of any personand to indicate it by the motion of itshandslet us try now if it will indicate myapproach said lucyas she approached the hands beganto move and when as her brother bidher she took it up and held it nearer toher the motion increased and when ashedesired she breathed through the holesin the sides one hand affected by herbreath seemed to fly round the circlewhile the other numbered the revolutionslucy was pleased full as much even asherbrother could expect she stoodwatching its quick variations as shebreathed upon it or withdrew her breathbut brother said she did notyou tell me that this has been but latelyinvented how comes that why didnot people think of it before was notthe grass always there wherever this wasfound in indiai suppose it was said harry butnobody had observed it aw i knowabout it is that in trees's cyclopedia itsays that this kind of grass was discoveredin india about the year ithink was not it uncle by captaineater who was employed in makingsome survey or some observations andwho wanted a very accurate hygrometerto measure the smallest quantities ofmoisture and he tried this grass andfound it succeed and found that it lastsbetter and is more sensible than the englishoataccurately remembered harry saidhis uncle but pray does the cyclopediatell you how it happened that captaineater took notice of this grass no uncle said harry how wasitr'he told a friend of mine that oneevenings as he was walking without bootsin that grass he was annoyed by its frequentcatching in his stockings and whenhe took them off at night he found themfull of this grass which had twisted itselfe into them when he pulled it out heobserved it particularly then his attentionbeing fixed he remarked the sensibilityof this grass to moisture and hethought of using it for his scientific purposesas an hygrometer how very lucky that it plagued himthat day said lucy by sticking in hisstockingshow well it was that he observed itsproperties when he took it out saidharry and that he thought of applyingit to some good use i am afraid ishould have thrown it away without observingit at night particularly i mighthave been sleepy and tired and thenuncle the world would never have hadthis nice little convenient instrument would you harry and would youlucy said their uncle like to have thisnice little convenient instrument for yourowntheir eyes brightening with pleasurethey answered that they should like itvery muchthen it is yours my dears said theiruncle i give it you in the hope that itwill teach you accuracy and patiencethey said that they would try to keepa register of it regularly but lucy addedthat if it was only to teach her patienceshe should not like it so well as if shethought it would be also of some use toher uncle or for some other purposeher uncle assured her that it wouldbe useful to him he said that he hadtwo friends one living in ireland theother in america they wished to keepa register of the damp or dryness of theatmosphere in those countries to be comparedwith england then cried lucy we will keepthe register for england with pleasure that will be something grand and worthwhile but said her uncle if you attemptthis it must be done with accuracyor it will be of no use rememberi tell you it will be a trial ofyour patience do not begin it unlessyou think you can keep it regularly forsix monthshalf a year said lucy that is avery long time harry however wasnot afraid to undertake it because hehad tried and had kept a register of abarometer for a whole year he saidhis register was not neat though it wasaccurate his figures were too large andstraggling often out of their proper columns but now he could use lucy ashis secretary and she could make niceeven figurestheir uncle wrote for them some necessarydirections he said that it wouldbe requisite to do every time they registeredtheir hygrometer a sum in divisionof a certain large number of figuresthis did not alarm lucy for she wasexpert in division and she rejoiced thatshe should be able to do this sum readilyfor her brother and that she should bewanted and useful every day or may betwice a day they were eager to showtheir hygrometer to their father but hehad gone from home for a few daysit was settled that the first thing theyshould do every morning of their livesmust be to examine and write down theirhygrometer registry harry was alwaysto xad off and lucy to write downwhoever has tried to keep a daily registeror to do any thing regularly everydayand at a certain hour must knowthat it is not a very easy task and wheretwo persons are concerned the difficultyis more than doubled with the chancesof one or the other failing in punctualityand quarrelling about whose fault it mightbe harry and lucy therefore by theexperienced and the candid will be allowedsome credit for keeping their registeraccurately every day for a monthwithout having complained of each otherlucy repeated that she was very glad itwas to be of some great use to her uncleat the end of the time for that withoutthis motive and the pleasure of helpingher brother and of making nice figuresfor him she confessed that she should nothave patience to go on with itthank you again and again mammafor allowing me to learn with harry as iused to do i am much happier alreadybut mamma if i knew ever so much ifharry was not fond of me and i of himwe could not be really happy could wedo you think mammain truth my dear child i do not thinkyou could said her mother i am sure quite sure we could notcontinued lucy suppose i knew allthe histories and all the poems and allthe stories in the whole world and that icould draw and play on the pianoforteand dance better than any body in theuniverse i am sure mother i could neverbe happy unless i loved my brother andhe loved me nor could he be happyeven if he knew all the scientific dialoguesand all the mechanics and hydrostaticsand optics but oh cried lucy interruptingherself in this enumeration of the ics there is papa come home i could notthink mamma what made you start up soquickly in the middle of my opticslucy had too much discretion to producetheir hygrometer the very moment her fathercame home she waited till he hadfinished what he was saying to her mother comprehending that this might beof more consequence to him and moreinteresting than even their new possessionand their new arrangements assoon however as he had leisure to attendto her when he turned to lucy and holdingout his hand to her said have youany thing new to tell me my little girl she answered eagerly yes papa a greatdeal he made room for her on one sideof him and for harry on the other andthen they showed him their hygrometer and lucy told him how much she wishedto understand what her brother had beenlearning the preceding years and she toldhim of harry's intention to bring her up tohim in science she promising to go asslowly and he as fast as he could and totire her as little as possible her fatherwas glad that harry had learned by hisfirst attempt that he should not on anysubject tell all he knew to his sister atonce nor expect that she could at oncetake as great an interest as he did on subjectsof which she was ignorant particularlywhen she had to endure all the labourand mortification which a beginner mustgo through before learning any newscience can be easy or entertaining hisfather advised harry not to attempt todescribe all the small parts and detail ofmachines not to go over all the a b csof descriptions in engravings which howeverrequisite for those who are to makethem would be unnecessary to lucy headvised harry to try to give his sister aclear knowledge of the principles of someof the most useful inventions and discoverieshe promised to assist wheneverhe came to any difficulty but he desiredhim to try first how he could go onby himself in explaining to his sisterand he repeated to lucy what her motherand uncle had said to her about attentionhe told her that whenever hehad attempted lately to teach her he hadobserved that she did not attend as wellas formerlyi know it papa i try all lean but icannot i do not know how it is i cannotsaid lucy every word that is saidseems as it were to awaken some otherwords and every thing i see and hearmakes me recollect something else andmy thoughts are flying off backwards andforwards and sideways and every waywhile harry's can go on straight forwardalways thinking of what he is about or ofthe very thing that is said to him i usedto be able to do the same said lucysighing sigh no more lucy said her fathersmiling no great harm is done yourhabits of attention have been spoiled andyour power of attending is consequentlydiminished but with your own good willand good sense we shall soon set all thisto rights again your perceiving and reflectingupon what passes in your ownmind will assist you very muchpapa said lucy i know how it allhappened aunt pierrepoint did not thinkit signified much whether i attended strictlyas my uncle says or not she said i wasquick enough and i will tell you papawhat made a great impression upon monce i heard a gentleman talking aboutgenius and he said of me that he wonderedhow i learned every thing with solittle attention that i was always lookingabout and listening to all that people saidand yet that i was so quick i am ashamedpapa to tell you any more said lucystopping you have said quite enough my dearlittle girl to prove to me that you are notquite a goose as long as any person isashamed of being flattered there is hopethat they will learn to despise and dislikeflattery i give up only those who getover the pain of the shame and who thenlike it shamelessly and swallow down moreand more of it till at last they end by beingfools to flattery without knowing theirwretched state i hope i shall never be in that wretchedstate mamma said lucy with a look ofmuch apprehension harry will you takecare of me and of myself said harry well now to business said theirfather what do you wish to learnfirst lucyshe said that she wished to be made perfectlyacquainted with the air pump becauseharry had reproached her with nothaving understood that fine poetic descriptionof it which she had learned byheart and repeated he said that to besure he could easily make her understandhis uncle's air pump because she alreadyknew the principle of a common waterpumpdo i said lucy smiling i didnot know that i knew it and here sheagain thought of the man who had talkedprose all his life without knowing it butshe refrained from making an allusion tohim though it was ready on her lipsharry recalled to her mind the experimentswhich their father had shown themtwo years agodo not you remember aid he theexperiment he showed us with a roll oftape that was put under a wine glasswhich was turned down and plunged intoa bason of water and then the tape waspulled out and unrolled by degreeslucy remembered all this and what happened said harrywhen the tape was pulled from under theglass lucy answered that the water rosein the glass and why said harrybecause when the tape was taken outthere was left in its place a vacancy avacuum you call it then the water whichwas in the bason rose into that vacantplace and why did it rise pursued harry because it was pressed by the weightof the air pressing on all the water in thebasin and it was forced up into the glasswhere there was no air nothing to preventor resist itvery well now i am satisfied saidharry you remember it clearlybecause i understood it clearly at thstime it was first shown to me said lucy my father was so patient and explainedit to me so slowly and clearlywell said harry you have provedto me that you understand the first principleon which pumps are made for alldepends on making a vacuum into whichthe water rises or is raised the firstthing to be done is to make a vacuumnow lucy in a common pump suchas there is in the yard for pumping upwater where do you think the vacuummust be before the water can rise lucy said she supposed that it must bein the inside of the body or tube of thepumpyes we call it the bore said harrynow tell me how you would make avacuum within itoh my dear harry that is too difficulta question for me said lucy howcan i tell how to make a vacuum in thebyre as you call it of a great pump where is the difficulty said harry do not be frightened by the word bore or if you are alarmed by the idea of a greatpump suppose a little one as small as youplease as small suppose as the glass tubeof the barometer that would be easy to suppose butcould there be so small a pump saidlucyto be sure as well as of the largestsize only it would raise less water butnow go on straight forward lucy mydear do not ask me any of your startingoff questions you must let me ask youquestions and you are to answer if i can said lucyyou can i assure yon my dear saidharry in his most persuasive tone if youwill only believe that you can and keepsteady i ask you how you would make avacuum in this tube let me consider let me recollectwhat did my father do when he made avacuum in the wine glass said lucy toherself he put in a roll of tape whichfilled up the whole glass and then drewit out little by little so as not to let anyair into the glass while he was pulling itout again but i cannot get a roll of tapeinto the small tube said lucyno not a roll of tape said harry but if you consider what was the purposeor use of putting the roll of tape intothe glass and drawing it out again youwill perceive that putting in and drawingout any thing else in the same mannerwould do as wellthe purpose was first to force theair that was in the glass out of it saidlucy and to prevent any more afterwardsfrom getting into the place whichthe tape took up and which remained vacantas it was drawn out leaving a vacuumat last now you are coming on very welllucy said harry if i can put in any thing of any sortinto the little tube which forces the airout and then if i could keep the air outthere would be a vacuum for you harryvery well you will now quite understanda pump and you will soon knowhow to use it lucyas to that said lucy i know howto pump already only i am not strongenough stay stay lucy knowing how topull a handle up and down which i supposeis all you mean is not understandingwhat i mean by knowing what pumpingis or how it is done i have seen men and maids oftenpumping at the pump in the yard saidlucywhat happens when they pump saidharry the water comes out of the spout afterthey have pumped a little while said lucywhat do you mean by pumpingpersisted harryi cannot tell you exactly harry becausei never saw the inside of the pumpi only know that they move the handle upand down and i believe there is somethingfastened to it which i supposebrings up the water but i do not knowhow exactlyi believe not indeed said harry then you see mrs quickquick youdid not understand what i meant by pumpingnow come with me and i willshow you in my room the nice glass pumpwhich my father made for me you cannotsee into the inside of the pump in theyard but when once you have seen myglass pump you will understand the insideof all othershe showed her in the first place a glasstube in which there was a spout near thetop the tube was open at the top andat the bottom there was a little door orvol i f valve which opened upwards only hepoured water into this tube to shove herthat the water would rest upon this valvewithout its letting any of it through hethen emptied out the water now saidhe you know there is nothing but airin this tube look at this which is calledthe piston of a pump the piston wasa cylinder which fitted tight into thetube at the top of it there was a valvelike that at the bottom of the tube whichalso opened one way and that was upwardsharry pushed it up several timeswith his finger to show lucy that itopened easily and he made her feel that itdid so he then put the tube into a tubof water the tube resting on two blocks ofwood which raised it from the bottom ofthe tub so that there was room for thewater to flow in through the lowest valvelucy as he desired held the glass tubeupright while he pushed down the pistonto which there was a long handlenow lucy what happens within side of the tube said harrynothing that i know of said shebut that you have pressed the air in thetube closer together very true do you see the valve atthe bottom is it shut or openlucy said it was shutand what keeps it shut the air that you are pressing downupon it said lucyhe pressed the piston down farthernow look again said he and tellme what happens i see the little door at the top of thepiston open said sheharry asked her what she thought hadopened itthe air said she underneath itwhich i suppose you could not compressany more and which has forced its wayuphe now drew up the piston and againasked what happened lucy saw thevalve at the top of the piston shut and shesaw the water rush through the valve atthe bottom of the glass pump and rise inf its tube and when harry again plungeddown the piston the water came throughthe valve in the piston and when he drewit up again it carried up all the water tothe top of the tube where it flowed outof the spoutjust as it does in the great real pumpsaid lucyand now you do know what i meanby pumping said harryhe pumped on for some time and thenlet her take the handle and work for herselfhe questioned her and made herrepeat her explanation till he was satisfiedand she was satisfied that she clearlyunderstood that the thing to be done inpumping and by pumping is to force theair out of a certain space to produce a vacancyor vacuum into which the esterrushes and rises or rather said harryto speak more accurately is pressed andsupported by the surrounding air andwater perhaps i ought to tell you thatthere is no perfect vacuum but i will notbe too exact with you at first lest i shouldtire you therefore i will not tell you allthe differences between a lifting pumpand a sucking pump and a forcing pump besides i am not sure that i know themall myself i weill not tell you even aboutwater always finding its own leveli am very much obliged to you saidlucynor will i tell you continued harryabout the weight of the column of waterwhich a certain quantity of air can sustain i think i do know something aboutthat said lucy or i did know it oncehowever thank you for not telling me toomuch at a time especially about all thedifferent pumps you talked of leave myhead quite clear with the vacuum thati understand now and the use which ismade of it and i understand all that happenswhen the piston of the pump is pulledup and pushed down and now that you know said harrywhat pumping is i will ask mamma toletus go to the great pump in the yardthat you may see lucy the same sort ofthing in large that you have seen insmalltheir mother went with them to look atthe pump in the yard the handle wasso high that harry could not well manageto use it but his mother called for one ofthe servants who pumped for themthe servant filled a tub with the waterwhich he had pumped up and as helifted it to carry it away he said that heand all the servants in the house were veryglad that the pump which had been outof order was now well repaired becauseit had been great labour to them to go tothe windlasswell in the garden for waterwhenever it was wanted and to bringheavy tubs of it many times aday thisobservation made lucy the more sensibleas she said of the great convenience of apumpthis is a really and truly useful machinecontinued she useful to greatgreat numbers of people for the commonestbusiness that must be done everydayand almost every hour and it is aseasy for ignorant people to use as for themost learned what an excellent contrivance how happy the man must havebeen who made the first pump when hefound it would do and felt the water comingand saw it pouring out at the spout delightful said harrynow harry my dear tell me somethingabout the air pump no no my dear that would be toomuch said harry looking very prudentone pump aday is enough for you iwill keep the air pump till tomorrowafter all this wisdom what did they donext how did harry and lucy spendthe remainder of this morning two wholehoursif we tell we shall not be believed exceptby those who are themselves childrenor by those who know children right wellandtheir sudden falls from the heights ofwisdom to the depths of follyharry and lucy spent all that remainedof this morning in pumping up throughthe little glass pump the water of a puddlein harry's garden they could have ladledit all out in three minutes and two moderatesized tubs would have held it andhave carried it all away but this wouldhave been too obvious too easy a way ofgoing to work it must all pass throughthe glass pump and so they worked ontill their backs ached and till the dirty puddlewater had so soaked into the leather ofthe piston and so clogged the valve withmud that it would move no moreduring this pumping and draining ofthe puddle many misadventures befelharry's trowsers and lucy's clean frock clean no more it may be recorded forthe advantage of little washerwomen whowith hands unskilled may unadvisedlyattempt to wash out fresh spots that themore lucy tried to get rid of hers themore they appeared what seemed quiteout while it was wet came in again assoon as it dried and the spots spreadinto blotches with obstinate edges of yellowso that altogether the frock insteadof looking better for these operations wasworse than ever before it was half dry oh how unlucky before it had half dried after dipand scrub the fifth the sound of carriagewheelswas heard morning visitorstheir garden was full in sight of thehouse up jumped harry upon what hecalled his throne a heap of stones fromwhence he had a full view of the carriageit was one he had never seen beforelucy clambered after him to share theexalted view from his throne and to assisthis judgment with her eyes and her imaginationa lady was getting out of thecarriage lucy did not know who it wasshe confessed but she imagined that itmust be a certain mrs hanbury whoowed her mother a visit i am sure it is mrs hanbury and idare say that her daughter is with hertherefore i will not go in for miss hanburyis always very fine and i should notlike that she should see me in this frockin this sad condition and oh harryfthey must not see you in those trowsersi will show you how mrs hanbury andmiss hanbury would look at us we willnot go ingo in upon no account said harryas to my trowsers i do not care whatyour fine miss hanbury or mrs hanburythink or how they look at them or at mebut i hate going into a room where thereare strangersharry observed however that notwithstandinglucy's certainty that the visitorswere mrs and miss hanbury no girl gotout of the carriage and there was a gentlemanhow can that be said lucy forthere is no mr hanbury let them bewho they may we will not go in repeatedsheto this harry heartily assented hedisliked morning visitors particularly so do i so does every body saidlucy i hope they will not see usfrom the house i hope mamma will notsend for us harry we had better sit upin your observatory in the great sycamoretreecome up then this instant criedharry give me your hand and i willpull you upin harry's observatory in the great sycamoretree they both sat snugly for sometimetill he saw through the branchessome people standing at the drawingroomwindow that they might not be seen bythese people harry advised leaving theobservatory and removing a step higherinto what he called his dark attics wherethe branches were so thick that he wassure no morning visitors could see themor think of looking for them he had satthere many a time he said while ladieshad passed under the tree chattering withoutever spying him scarcely howeverhad they mounted and safely lodged themselvesin the attics which to say thetruth were ill able to hold two lodgers ata time when harry exclaimed it is all over with us there is mammaherself at the window beckoning to usbut she cannot see us said lucycertainly not said harry unlessshe saw my white trowsers when i wasclambering up here into the attics white trowsers oh no i am sureshe did not said lucy but there she is said harry wavingher handkerchief lucy do not go do not go in for now ihave a green streak worse than all therest said lucy i am sure mammadoes not see us and i dare say she does notwant us really herself but perhaps mrshanbury asked for me and mamma justbeckonedthe signal was repeated at intervalstwo or three times lucy had some doubtsbut the fear of mrs hanbury s seeing herdirty gown prevailed the handkerchiefceased to wave and they remained intheir tree nearly an hour a much longertime than they had expected harry hadbeen resolute from the first and had nowavering during this hour as he satquite at ease in his tree he said nowis a good time to think of the puzzle myuncle gave me about a three gallon afive gallon and an eight gallon vessellucy interrupted him several times byscrambling up and down to see if the carriagevas gone or whether mamma wavedher handkerchief again at length havingsucceeded in solving his problem heheld her fast by the gown insisting uponher sitting still and thinking of it whichas he assured her would make the timeappear to go much faster there was agentleman who had two haymakers onehot day they worked very hard making hayand when they had finished the hay ricklate in the evening the gentleman calledthem to his hall door and said mygood men you must be very thirsty i willgive you some beer to drink here areeight gallons for you but you must dividethis beer so that each of you may haveexactly half and this you must do beforeyou drink a drop of itthat was very easily done saidnolucy each was to have four whatpuzzle is there in this stay stay mrs quickquick you willbe puzzled yet before you have donethe gentleman had only three vessels inhis house it is said the first held eightgallons the beer was in this the secondheld five gallons and the third three gallonsand these two were empty nowmanage it as you will lucy and withthese vessels divide the beer so that youcan prove to me that each man has fourgallons exactly you may pour the beerbackwards and forwards as often as youplease from one of these vessels to anotherlucy began and poured from one toanother in imagination for some timewithout success pour how she wouldthere was at the end of her measuresalways five gallons in the eight gallonvessel and three in the five at last sheperceived how it could be done andshowed how she could prove to harryillthat she had divided it equally fourgallons harry in the eight gallon vesseland four gallons in the five gallonvessel'so completely had her attention beenabsorbed by this puzzle that she had notheard the sound of the departing wheelsof the visitors carriage and when sheagain peeped out of their hiding placethey were surprised to see that thecarriage was qonewhen they went in their mother toldthem that she was sorry they had notsooner made their appearance becausethe lady and gentleman who had beenwith her were remarkably agreeable peopleand had told many things that wereentertaining and interestingthen mamma it was not mrs andmiss hanbury said lucy how veryprovoking i am sorry mamma we havemissed hearing entertaining things whowere the peoplesir rupert and lady digby friendsof your father'si never lizard of them before saidlucy very likely my dearmamma what sort of entertainingthings did they tell said lucythey gave us an account of a shipwreckwhich happened lately on part ofthe sea shore near the place where theyive oh mamma tell it me criedharry yes pray mamma said lucy first tell me did not you see mebeckoning and making signals to you tocome in my dears said their mother yes mamma we saw you saidharry but we thought that it wouldbe tiresome and we did not like to goin i liked better to go on with what iwas abouthis mother told harry that she wouldnot have beckoned to him unless she hadtil ought it was worth his while to comein and added she smiling youmust now abide by your own choicefor i will never tell you of the shipwreck pray at least mamma tell it toharry said lucy because it was allmy fault that we did not come in idid not like to come because look atmy frock mammait is very much soiled indeed saidher motherwith the water from my puddle andmy glass pump mamma said harry that was my faulther mother asked lucy why she couldnot put on another frock have not youany other lucy yes mamma said lucy colouring i have but i could not put on any ofthem because one is so short it comesup to here and i forgot to let down thetucks and another has a great tear init i intended to have given it to bemended this morning and one sleeve ishalf out of the third mamma i tore itlast night as i was reaching down a bookfrom the uppermost shelfher mother said that there must be nomore experiments of any kind till lucyshould have these things mendedi know that is quite right mammasaid lucy i expected you would sayso i will go up to my room directlyand let down the tucks but mammawhile i am away could you be sokind as to tell harry the story of theshipwreck i could said her mother smilingbut i will not in the first place ishould be sorry to tell it when you werenot present but i do not intend to tellit to him at all for if i were to repeatto him every thing entertaining which iheard this morning he would dependupon my doing the same another timeand he would not exert himself to conquerthat feeling of bashfulness whichprevents his coming into a room wherethere are strangers and which makes himalways say i would rather stay outof the room and go on with my ownaffairs now brother for the air pump criedlucy as you used to say now papafor the barometer my uncle said harry has been sogood as to lend me his portable air pumpto show you was not it good of him tolend itvery good indeed said lucy andhow convenient to have so many thingsportable portable barometer portable hygrometerportable air pumpnow lucy recollect what was thegreat thing to be done in pumping saidharrywas not it to make a vacuum saidlucy hesitating as if she was afraid ofmaking a mistakeyes to be sure my dear said harrybe quite certain about thati am quite certain said she i wasonly afraid to say it at first lest i shouldnot be riorhtbut do not be afraid when youknow a thing know it very firmly thetruth cannot alter between yesterday andto day nor can the truth ever alter youknowthat is a great comfort said lucy was not it boyle who invented the airpump or was it torricelli neither said harry it was thatpoetry you repeated which put that mistakeinto your headand when onceone has got any thing wrong into one'shead there is no getting it out againbut you are partly right boyle improvedthe airpump very much and itis sometimes called the boileau vacuumthat is boyle's vacuum but boyle wastoo honest a man to claim for his ownthe first vacuum i mean the first makinguse of it for the air pump he knewand always said it was otto garrick'sinvention well i dare say it was said lucy you need not say any more about iti do not care much who made the firstvacuum nor who first made use of it forthe air pumpyou do not lucy my dear considerwhat you say suppose i had inventedthe air pump or something asgreat would you my sister like thatsomebody else should take from me thehonour and glory of the inventionno i should not said lucy butyou are my brother and alive and to besure i should be anxious that you werenot robbed of the glory but those otherpeople mr otto guerick and mr boyleare nothing to me besides they havebeen dead and buried long ago andwhat signifies it now to any body it signifies a great deal said harry suppose it was my father or my grandfatheror my great grandfather shouldnot i care would not you then sowould otto guerick's or boyle's childrenor grandchildren or great grandchildrenif there are any living and there is agreat family of boyle i know and doyou think that for the world they wouldgive up the boileau vacuuii suppose not said lucy butnow let us go on to the air pump itselfand the vacuum let it be whose it willso we will said harry but beforei show it to you remember that whatyou are going to see is a pump for pumpingout air not for pumping up water soput water quite out of your head i have put water quite out of my headi understand that the air pump is to pumpout air but brother before you beginlet me say one thingsay it then if it is not poetryno it is only that i think a pair ofbellows is a sort of air pump heyharry well that is not foolish lucy youmay call a pair of bellows a sort of airpump only that bellows never could be aright air pump without two valves butdo not go on thinking of them all the timei am explaining to you now look at myuncle's air pump you see this glasscontinued harry and he pointed to alai'de glass bell which stood over a sortof frame or stand lucy what do youthink is in this glassair i suppose said lucy it is full of air and of nothing elsesaid harry the thing to be done isto get all the air that is in the bell outof it and that is to be done by meansof these pumps continued he pointingto two tall cylinders of brass which stoodupon the stand with the glass bell theycommunicated at the bottom with a pipewhich opened into the bell there wasa handle by which as he told lucy shecould move the pistons of these pumps upand down just in the way in which the pistonmoved up and down in the water pumpyesterday said she i see i see itis all nearly the same thing only thatthis pumps air out as you said andthe other water i understand it all perfectly stay stay mrs quickquick you donot understand it all perfectly yet yousee only the likenesses but there are differenceswhich you do not see yet andcannot my dear mrs quickquick becauseit takes a great deal more time tosee the differences than to catch the likenessesmrs quick she put her hand upon his mouth beforehe could repeat the offensive wordsbrother do not call me mrs quickquickand i will be as slow as youplease and i will not tell you of any ofthe likenesses i see i will be quite silentand only nod my head when i understandever so perfectly then look at the air pump which isbefore you said harry and observewhat i do i am going to move thehandle which you see at the top whichwill raise up one of the pistons what isunderneath the pistonnothing said lucy at first butafterwards she added i believe there isa vacuumtrue and what happens directlysaid harryair comes in directly to fill it i supposesaid shewhere does it come from saidharryit must come from the bell throughthis pipe said lucy which leads fromthe bell to the bottoms of the pumpsthen when that happens there isless air in the bell than there was beforeis not there said harry now movethe piston down again and what happens you would press the air that is underthe piston back again up the pipe into thebell said lucy if there is not a valve atthe bottom of the pump that shuts againstit and prevents it from going back butthough i do not see it i suppose there issuch a valve because you told me that itwas necessary in all pumps you suppose rightly and you remembervery well said harry thereis such a valve and it prevents the airfrom going back into the bell when ivol i gpush the piston down but what becomesof the air it comes out into the open air throughthe valve in the piston i supposevery true now i will move thehandle again and repeat the operationi should have told you that we are assistedin pumping by the expansive forceof the airi do not understand that said lucyyes you do my dear if you will onlyrecollect the experiments papa showed youwith a bladder said harryages ago said lucyyes you remember seeing the bladderswell out with the expansive forceof the air and you may recollect thatafter blowing in air for some time whenwe tried to force in more air we couldnot the bladder swelled out so that wecould hardly hold its mouth together totie iti remember it said lucy if we had let go the string saidharry and the mouth of the bladderhad opened what would have happened the air would have forced its wayout said lucyyes air you know will expand andfill every empty place now i havepumped out all the air that i can fromthe bell and now that it is as empty aswe can make it we call it a vacuumthough very accurate people would tellyou lucy that it is not a perfect vacuumit will do for me said lucy andi think i understand the air pump reallynow is there any other difference betweenit and the water pump brotheryou said there was a differencei did say so and i will explain toyou what it is if you will answer myquestions patiently what was it in theglass water pump that you saw yesterdaythat pressed up the water into the vacuumbelow the piston said harryit was the outer air the weight ofg the outer air pressing upon the surfaceof the water that was in the tub forcedthe water up into the tubetrue the same in all water pumpssaid harry but here is no water forit to press upon how then is this vacuumfilled by the weight or force of the airitself only i believe said she what air said harryit must be the air in the bell saidshe for i see no other but that is solittle that there cannot be weight enoughin thatno said he it is not by weightthat this pump acts but by the spring'wessof the air itself this is the differencewhich i wanted you to observe betweenthe air pump and water pumpsby the springiness of the air saidlucyyes said harry you felt the forceof that springiness in the bladder when itwas full of airlucy said she should like to feel itacrain she had almost forgotten it harryblew into a bladder and filled it with airand when it was full bid her try to press ittogether when she tried to do it she perceivedthe sort of resistance that it madeand she felt the force with which after shehad squeezed it it returned to its formerplace and formthe same springiness said harry or what is called the elasticity of the airin the bell is what fills the vacuum belowthe piston each time it is drawn up nowhereis the description and plate of it inscientific dialogues and this is all thatyou need know about it at present stayi will just look at the print of the air pumpin trees's cyclopedia and see if i haveleft out any thing that i ought to tell youas he opened the book and as lucysaw the engravings she looked a littlealarmedthere seem to be as many differentair pumps as hygrometers said shesighing do not be afraid i am not going toshow them to you all said harry butnow that you know the general principleyou would soon feel it easy as i did tounderstand them oh no said lucy there seem tobe such a number of pipes and valves andlittle as and s and p's and sthey only relate to the contrivances toprevent the outer air from coming in whilewe are pumping the air out of the vesselthat is to be emptied which it is constantlytrying to do one pump is better than anotheronly as it does this most effectuallyand most easily and as it more perfectlyempties or exhausts the vessel by thebye i should tell you that this glass vesselis called a receiver and when it isemptied it is called an exhausted receiveri was puzzled at first by those words exhaustedreceiverthank you harry for rememberingthat for menow my dear lucy you shall work alittle at the air pump yourself as you didat the water pump yesterdayoh thank you thank you said shejoyfully there is nothing like workingoneself it fixes a thing so well in mymemory i remember the look and touchof the things much better afterwardswhile harry was placing the machineso that it should be convenient to lucyshe turned to look at the book of engravingsthat lay open on the table how well this air pump is donesaid she it is very like my uncle's not quite perhaps i will take care tomind about the differencesthis is very like it said harrythere is no difference of any consequenceif we had not had my uncle's saidlucy i think you could have made meunderstand the air pump quite well fromthis engraving that is after my havingseen the glass pump yesterday and itsvalve and the piston but without that icould not have understood it from thisrepresentation because i see here onlythe outside of a pump even though youhad described the valves and explainedthem to me ever so clearly i should nothave understood them so well as by havingseen and touched them and moved themmyselfcertainly said harry but next toseeing the real thing these engravingsor drawings help one very much lookthough you see only the outside of thepump in that perspective view here is theinside of an air pump all laid open foryou you know what is meant by a section soh yes said lucy suppose anythingto be cut in two what you see insideof each part when they are separatedis a section papa explained that andshowed it to me when he cut a lemon intwo for me i remember this minute aswell as if i saw it before my eyes thelook of the lemon with the pippins cut inhalf each in their little cells the cells cutopen too and i remember very well my dear interruptedharry you remember very well whatis meant by a section therefore you willunderstand this plate and this figurebut lucy never be ashamed to tell meif you do not understand you knowi have but just learnt these things myselfand i remember the odd mistakes i usedto make and the puzzles i was in whenpapa was teaching melucy looked at the engravings nowwithout alarm because as she knew whatthey represented they did not puzzle herand she was not afraid of being tiredafter having looked at the section shesaid it made the whole as plain to her eyeas if it had been made of glass somethingfarther she said to herself about aman's having a window in his breast buteither she did not say it loud enough forharry to hear or he did not think it muchto the purpose for without attending to ithe shut the book saying now we havehad enough of the prints i thought justnow you were very eager to work the airpump yourself lucy so i am still said lucy only itg was not quite ready and i looked atthe prints between times now let mepumppump away this way said he showingher how to hold the handle and howto move it backwards and forwards andhow she worked two pistons at the sametimeshe worked it but not without difficultyafter she had pumped for some minutesshe found the difficulty increasing andasked from what this aroseharry said from the resistance made bythe pressure of the outward air which becomesgreater as the receiver is more andmore exhausted he took off the receiverand put her hand over the hole at the topof the pipe which communicates with thepumps and bid her move the pistonswith her other hand gently she did soand felt that part of the palm of her handwhich was over the pipe drawn in herbrother repeated gently gently as shemoved the handle indeed soon therewas no occasion to say so to her for shefelt the palm drawn in so as to be quitepainful and she grew red with fright oh brother it hurts me very muchi cannot take my hand away what shalli dostop pumping said he and do notbe frightened there is no dangershe stopped pumping and her brotherturned a screw so as to let the air into thereceiver this relieved her hand sheheld it up to show him a purple circle allround the inside of the handhe pitied it a little a very little lucythought not quite enough i know said he exactly how muchit hurts you because i have done the samea hundred times to my own hand mydear i wanted you to feel as i did myselfthere is as you said nothing like feelingto make one remember well what doyou think caused this at first lucy answered that she did notknowbecause you are thinking of the painin your hand said hethat is true said lucy but it ispretty well over now what did you askme i asked you what caused that kind ofsucking in of your hand into the exhaustedreceiver fshe thought for an instant and answeredi believe it was the pressure of theouter air which was trying to get in atthat hole to fill the vacuum and whichwas prevented by the palm of my handwhich it then drove in as much as it couldwell now i am sure i have felt thepressure of the viewless air and nowyou must let me repeat the linethe spring and pressure of the viewless airharry repeated it after her declaring itwas a very pretty line besides it had somecommon sense in it lucy had said itquite at the right time when it did notinterrupt him or any thing that was goingon he was so much pleased with it thathe begged of her to repeat all those linesjagain for him and when they went out totheir garden soon afterwards instead ofbeginning to dig he desired her to saythe lines once more for that he must learnthem by heart thus he learnt from hersome of her taste for poetry while sheacquired from him some of his love ofsciencein repeating these lines lucy observedwhich of them alluded to the barometerand which to the air pump yhen shehad first learned them by rote barometerand air pump had been so jumbled in herhead that she could not understand themchow up exhausted tubes bright currents flowof liquid silver from the lake belowweigh the long column of th incumbent skiesand with the changeful moment fall or rise she now knew described the barometerand the succeeding lines the air pump how as in brazen pumps the pistons movethe membrane valve sustains the weight above stroke follows stroke the gelid vapour fallsand misty dewdrops dim the chrystal walls rare and more rare expands the fluid thinand silence dwells with vacancy withinwhile harry was learning these linesby heart lucy stopped as she promptedthe couplet concerning gelid vapourand misty dewdrops and objected ido not understand about misty dewdropson the chrystal walls i did not perceiveany vapour on the glass bellher brother told her that these linesalluded to a fact which he had not yetmentioned to her which his father hadbut very lately told him and he was notclear enough yet about it to attempt toexplain it to herlucy said she was satisfied to waitthat it was best not to know every thingat once and pleasant to have somethingto look forward to but altogether sheconfessed that though the air pump wascurious and ingenious to use the air todrive itself out yet the water pump shethought a much grander and a much moreuseful machine she thought the airpump was not of any useharry smiled and answered so ithought at first but my dear that wasowing to my ignorance and when youknow more you will find that the air pumpis of great use there are many experimentsin natural history as papa showedme that could never have been tried anddiscoveries that could never have beenmade without it for instance to giveyou a little peep into the matter we couldnever without an air pump have knownthat a guinea and a feather would fall tothe ground in the same time if there wasno air to resist the fall of either of thema guinea and a feather a heavyguinea and a light feather i oh brother tvery true i assure you as you willsee one of these days harry now i think i recollect i heardthis about the guinea and the feather beforeor read it somewhere and somethingelse too about the guinea's making nomore noise than the feather when it fallsyou will show me this too will youi am not sure that i can lucy saidharry i tried in this air pump and idid not find it was so the guinea fellon the metal plate here at the bottom andthis plate touches the outer air and ringsmakes a noisei do not clearly understand why itshould make a noise when it falls or whyit should not said lucyi cannot explain it yet said harry and i must try the experiment about thenoise over again to make myself surewhether i am right or wrong i am certainthat the feather and guinea come to theground in the same time for that experimenti have tried often and it always succeededshow it to me now said lucyno not now but you shall see allthis and a great deal more in time saidharry but lucy how could you saythat the air pump is of no use whenyou know more about it you will seehow much you were mistaken you willfind that all we know about the specificgravities the different weights of bodiesand a great many curious facts aboutsound and i cannot tell you how manydelightful experiments and discoveriesabout the air that comes out of vegetablesand about the growing of seeds and ofplants and other experiments about differentkinds of gases as they are called i say my dear lucy as my father toldme none of these could have been knownwithout the air pump and then as to thegases oh my dear i cannot explainto you yet of what amazing consequencethe erases arelucy opened her eyes and stood lookingas if she thought she could never admireenough after a reverend pause shesimply repeated the word gases imy dear do not ask me about themyet you are a great great way yet fromthe gases but if you are good i will putyou into boiling water tonight at tea andget you on to steam and the steam enginethank you said lucy without knowingclearly what was to happen to hernow let us finish the new road to mygarden said harry but before wego i hope you will acknowledge the airpump besides being very ingenious is asuseful as the water pump at least heymrs lucy you look as if you were notconvinced yeti must wait till i have seen and till ican understand all these things before ican decide said lucyvery provokingly prudent and slowall at once muttered harry striking thestones of the new road with his pounderwhy brother how can i possibly saymore when you tell me i am so far fromthe gases and i am sure i did not understanda word you said about specific gravities as to the experiment about thefeather and the guinea i long to see thatwith all my heart and i dare say i shalllike the others about sound and seedsand vegetables particularly but theseare all curious experiments for grand philosopherswith your airpump they maybeuseful to your men of science brother but what i say is that the common pumpis more useful to common people everydayand i do say that i like those machinesbest which are most usefulall the rest harry heard patiently orpassively as he went on pounding hisroad but when she came to the last wordsand i do say that i like those machinesbest which are most useful he threw downhis pounder exclaiming you are veryungrateful lucy and he wiped his foreheadfor he was very hot but checkinghimself he added ungrateful to the airpump i meanmy dear i did not mean to be ungratefulto the air pump said lucy surprisedthat he could grow so warm aboutit i did not mean to affront the airpump or you i am sure i did not knowyou cared which i preferred what canmake you care so much about the pumps i do not know said harry but iwas vexed because you would not do justiceto the air pump and you gave youropinion against it without knowing all ithought that you were like that foolishwoman who said to the great chemistof what use is all your chemistry if itcannot teach you to tell me how to takethe ironmoulds out of my gown lucyi hope you will never be so foolishnever i hope said lucy and ihope you do not think i ever shallno i hope not said harry butnow i must say for the air pump there isa use that may be made of it in commonevery day in hot weather to make somethingthat is exceedingly agreeablewhat can it be said lucyparticularly with sweetmeats andcreams continued harry very goodof pine apple and pleasant of tea mammatold me not bad even of waterdo you mean ice said lucyyes said he the air pump canmake iceoh harry i cannot believe that howcan that possibly be done go to conversations on chemistrymy dear and you will be answeredvery well i will go to conversationson chemistry said lucy but not till ihave dug this bed in my garden and tiedup all my carnations and fed my whiterabbit and finished drawing the last snakeof my head of medusa and put by the sulphurin the cabinet and practised therising of the larkvery little chance indeed through allthat jumble of things of your rememberingon chemistry and the airpump said harryyou shall see said lucy i havealways a good memory for what i wishto doharry i have done all that i said iwould i have duo the bed in mv gardentied up my carnations fed my whiterabbit finished my medusa's snakes putthe sulphur into their cabinet practisedmy rising of the lark and read and understoodall that you marked forme in conversationson chemistryeighth edition vol i from page to really you have done a great dealsaid harry much more than i expectedi thought the white rabbit would havemade you forget every thing else anddo you quite understand all you havereadi do said lucy for it is veryclear as i was reading i thought i sawevery thing that was described and afteri had finished i was more anxious thanbefore to see the experiment you promisedto show me will you let me seeit now before i forget what i understandand while my head is ii it as you say i will show it to you as soon as everi can said harry with my father'sassistance he says that i must not attemptto try this experiment by ourselvesbecause sulphuric acid which must beused in it is very dangerous to meddlewith if we dropped any of it on our clothes it would burn holes in them andif we were to let a drop fall on ourselvesit would hurt us exceedingly so takecare lucy not to meddle with iti will take great care said lucy iwill look but not touchwhile harry went out of the room tohis father who was preparing for theirexperiment lucy talked to her motherabout the entertaining account which shehad just been reading of the method ofmaking ice in india even in the hottestnights how glad they must be mammasaid lucy when in the morning theysee the ice in the shallow pans whichthey leave out of doors during the night mamma continued she i think thatthe emily and caroline in this book musthave been very happy seeing all the niceexperiments mentioned here and talkingto their mother about them and learningfrom her this mrs b seems to be avery good kind mother i should like toknow her if she is really a live personis there such a real person as mrs bmamma yes there is lucythere is and are you acquainted withher mamma lucy asked eagerlyi am my dearyou are and what sort of person isshe do you like her oh yes mammai see by your look before you speak youlike her very muchi do indeed lucyi am glad she is an acquaintance ofyours mamma i hope i shall see hersome timeshe is more than an acquaintance ofmine she is my friend and if you deserveit my dear daughter i hope that she willsome time be yoursoh brother what do you think mammahas just told me cried lucy runningto meet harry who at this instant openedthe door and came in followed by hisfatheroh papa do you know but observing that her father's handswere full and that he and harry wereintent upon bringing in the air pumpshe wisely ceased her exclamations andstopped short in what she was going to sayright to be silent my dear said herfather as she stood by without uttering awords all the time they were preparing toshow her the experiment it is verytroublesome and disagreeable to have littlegirls or little any bodies or great anybodies talking all the time we are busypreparing experiments busy and anxious too you knowpapa for some experiments are dangeroussaid harrylucy had learned from what she hadjust read that sudden evaporation producescold sufficient to freeze in a vacuumeven when the outer air is muchabove the freezing point a thermometerwas near the air pump and lucylooked at it as harry desired she wouldshe saw that the mercury stood at degrees and she felt that the room waswarmher father placed under the receiver alarge shallow saucer filled with sulphuricvol i hacid and in it a small cup of waterraised on a little stand with a thermometerin it as described in conversations onchemistryhe asked lucy if she knew for whatpurpose the sulphuric acid was put thereshe said that the book had told her thatthe use of the sulphuric acid was to attractand absorb what was evaporated fromthe water before it is frozenand why should it be absorbedsaid her fatherbecause we want to freeze the watersaid lucytrue but you have not explained tomewhy we desire that the sulphuric acidshould absorb this vapourbecause papa that vapour fills uppart of the vacuum and it must be takenaway and the sulphuric acid does this asit absorbs it she understands it said harry nowwe may go on look lucy at what happens keep your eyes fixed upon thewatershe did so and she soon saw littlebubbles appearing on its surfaceit is beginning to do something saidshe but it looks more as if it were goingto boil than to freezeyou know said he that beforewater can freeze it must appear to boilyes appear i understand why yousay appear that was explained to me inthe booknow it begins to freeze said harrylook at the little spikes of icelucy saw this and said it was verycurious but still she did not look quite somuch surprised and pleased as harry hadexpected because els she said she sawonly such tiny spikes of ice she had imaginedthat all the remaining water inthe cup would have been turned at onceinto a solid lumpharry had talked to her about pineappleice and various other kinds of icewhich were so pleasant to eat in hot weatherand which he boasted that the airpump was so useful in assisting people toh make but from the tiny spikes she hadseen she could scarcely conceive that asufficient quantity could be made for thisgood purpose harry asked his mother ifshe would give them some cream and somesweetmeat to make sweet icecream hewished exceedingly to show lucy that itcould really be done in the air pumptheir kind mother provided them with allthat harry desired but she doubted thatthey would be able to succeed as it wasdifficult even to freeze water harry wasdetermined to try for he had heard that itwas a common practice in london to makeuse of an air pump in making icecreamhis father warned him that he was mistakenbut that he mighty and that hewould then find out what his mistake hadbeenharry put the cream into a small teacupand lucy mixed with it their raspberryjelly they put the tea cup into alarger cup filled with water and this theyplaced on a little stand which rested on asaucer filled with sulphuric acid withinthe glass bell of the air pump it happenedas it too often happens to youngexperimenters and to old ones also thattheir experiment did not succeed theycould not freeze the creamthey tried to console themselves by eatingthe cream and sweetmeat this washowever but an imperfect consolation toharry the honour of the air pump andhis own were at stake and he recurred tothe subject immediatelyi suppose my mistake was in puttingthe cream and sweetmeat into the airpump i was only told that the air pumpwas useful in making ice how they makethe ice cream with it i cannot guess saidharryi can tell you that said lucy for ionce saw the housekeeper make raspberryicecreamhave you said harry and howdid she do itshe put some cream and sweetmeatinto a tin cylinder tin i believe it was orpewter and this she surrounded witha great deal of pounded ice and saltthen she kept turning and turning thecylinder round with the cream in it till atlast it was all frozenoh oh said harry then now i seehow it is the air pump produces iceenough to freeze the cream that must betheway it is useful but how can it produce it in suchquantities as would be necessary it wouldbe a year at the rate i saw it going on witha little cupful of water said lucyharry acknowledged this and they appealedto their fatherhe told them that for this purposemuch larger air pumps than they had everseen would be necessary that consequentlya greater vacuum was producedand more water frozenthen it is true lucy you see the airpump does make the ice that makes the icecream and it is used for this purpose inlondon is not it papa not in london answered their fatherit is too expensive a process to be ofmuch advantage in this country but i believeit has been found useful in indiaein india there lucy you see howuseful it is and how far its fame goessaid harrydid they really send an air pumpmade in england to india for this purposeyes said her father and whenwe go to london i will show you mrcarey's apparatus for making iceoh thank you father and i shallreally see it made not in little spikes butinquantities said lucynow lucy you will acknowledgesaid harry that the air pump is usefulfor common purposesi will i do said lucyand you will have much more toacknowledge on this subject by and bysaid her father you will see other purposesfor common life to which it is appliedoh what father cried harrythat i will not tell you now harryin the evening before tea time harryand lucy played at spilling and afterwardsa game of chess in which harry wasbeaten because he was thinking of somethinghe was going to tell lucy about thesteam engine and he missed seeing a rogueof a knight that had got so close to hisking that he could not stir without beingcheckmatednow for the steam engine which youpromised to explain to me said lucyharry was afraid that he could not andturning to his father asked him to explainit but his father desired that he wouldfirst thy what he could dothis will be of service to you harryfor you will be then certain whether youcomprehend it yourself or not peopleare never sure they understand any thingperfectly till they have explained it to anotherif lucy is puzzled i will help youout of your difficulty whatever it may beharry said he would try and beganwith these words in the first place a steam engine is aivmachine there he stopped and beganaofain within the first place lucy you must knowthat the machine called a steam engine wasinvented he stopped short again anda third time he attempted it but he hesitatedand blushed and turning again to hisfather he said i cannot explain it beforeyou father i am so anxious it is veryodd i am not the least afraid of you youknow but i feel so ashamed and anxiousi think i should do it a great deal better ifyou were not byvery well said his father laughing then either you or i must go out of theroom it seems luckily for you i am justgoing into the next room ls that farenough off though the folding doors areo o oopen i assure you i shall not hear youthat will do perfectly said harry but what will you do about mamma she must stay to make tea said lucylook here is the urn coming in hadnot you better come out into the hall withme harry h no no said harry i do not mindmamma and now i think of it i wantthe urn lucy look at the steam comingfrom the top of that urn do you recollecta great while ago my father's holding acold plate over the steam coming from theurnyes lucy said she remembered itwell though it was a great while agoshe remembered that the cold of the platehad turned the steam into water again condensedit she recollected the drops onthe plate which afterwards ran into eachother and down into little streams whenthe plate was sloped yes interrupted harry you haverecollected enough of that you are clearthen that cold can condense steam that iscan turn it back again into water perfectly clear said lucynow recollect another thing saidharry which took up most room thesteam when it was steam or when it wasturned into water it took up much the most room whenit was steam said lucy i am surethat cloud of steam which you see risingfrom the tea urn and which takes up somuch room in the air might if you held acold plate over it this minute be condensedinto a few drops which would not halffill a tea spoonvery true said harry now do notthink any more about that but do you recollectour talking a great while agoabout the tea kettle's boiling over as it iscalled and do you remember my sayingthat if the top of the tea kettle wasscrewed down tight and if the spout wasstopped so that no steam could get outthat i thought the tea kettle would bursti remember it all said lucy andpapa said you were very right and iremember afterwards the bursting and explosionof my chesnuts and the story papatold us of his pouring the hot lead into thedamp elder to make a pencil and thefact i read about the bursting of a littlescientific dialogueshollow brass ball in which there was waterthat turned to steam and which causedan explosion that blew a whole founderto pieces then you have some idea of the powerof steam when it expands said harryto be sure i have said lucy iknow it is terribly great bursting andkilling people and tearing away howfrightened i should have been if i hadbeen papa when he was a little boy whenthe lead bounced up to the top of theceiling i am sure i was frightened enoughwhen my own horse chesnuts bouncedbut if this terribly great power saidharry is carefully used and cleverlyused it will do as you shall see the mostsurprising and the most useful things itwould raise water high as the house andhigher from the bottom of the deepestmine it could raise the weight of thisroom and all that is in it as high as thetop of the highest tree and higher oh brother brother said lucyit is quite tie it can do more in anhour than two hundred horses and fourteenhundred men it can drag loadedwaggons full of coal such as you haveseen going step by step the horses pullinghard it can pull these waggons up aseasily as i can pull your little cartmy dear brother how can i believeit said lucyit can drive across the sea against thepower of the wind and the tide a greatship with all the people in it and all theirhorses and carriages and all that theyhave in the worldis it really possible said lucy ihave heard people talking of steam boatsand of the working of steam engines andi remember papa's asking a gentleman whowas here the other day whether his steamengine was an hundred horse power buti never knew how this was nor could iconceive that steam could do all this byitself only steam like that said shefixing her eyes upon the steam that stillcame from the tea urnyes only steam like that repeatedharry think what we men can makeit do at our biddingreally and truly harry said lucy it does more at men's bidding than anyof the genii in the arabian tales morethan any of the slaves of aladdin's lampfor the hardest working of them could onlybe made to carry one housevery true indeed said harry andfor once he was pleased with an allusionbut continued lucy i should bevery much afraid of its doing some greatmischief some day like the african magiciando you remember but my dear interrupted harry do not tell me any thing more aboutthe african magician'only this one thing harry if youwould let me get it out of my head ishould attend so much betterno my dear lucy is it not veryhard upon me that you are to say everythingthat comes into your head and thatputs out of mine all that i want to rememberabout the steam engine for you i beg your pardon said lucy iwill not say a word more of the africanmagician go onbut poor harry could not go on immediately where was i said he tohimself what was i going to sayas he spoke he rubbed his forehead firstand then ran his fingers through his hairfrom the roots upwards till it was allpushed up and stood erect like quillsupon the fretful porcupinenow i recollect what i was going tosay cried harry look at the tea urnlucy ah but now it is too late thereis not steam enough it is not strongenough to do what i wanted you to seebut at first when the water was boilingand the steam rushing out at top youmight have seen it pushing up the lid ofthe urn till the steam got out then thelid fell and lay still till more steam wasformed and pushed it up again i wishyou had seen it going up and down i have often seen it said lucy andwatched it moving because sometimes iwas afraid the top would be quite liftedup and blown offand so it would said harry if itwere not for these little holes look herethrough which the steam escapes andwhich were made on purpose to let itescape without blowing off the top ordoing any mischiefthat is very prudent i am glad theholes are there said lucy but suppose they were not theresaid harry and the top left loose asit is now if the water boiled well aspeople say if a great deal of steam camerushing up and pushing out through thisplace where the top goes on you knowthe top would be lifted up and supposei lay on the top this weight continuedhe taking up from the table a small weightwhich was used for keeping down papers and suppose i put a lamp under the urnso as to keep the water boiling and sendingup fresh steam what do you thinkwould happen then i am not sure said lucy it wouldeither burst the urn or lift up the top withthat weight upon it it would i amsure lift up the top and weight becausethat would be the easiest way for the steamto get outto be sure it would require muchless force said harry to lift this littleweight than to burst the urn the expansiveforce of steam you know i toldyou would lift the house now supposethat instead of that urn with a little lampunder it there was a great fire as largeas a kitchen fire and larger and a greatiron boiler as large as the boiler you haveseen in the kitchen and larger with waterboiling in it and over the mouth of thatboiler suppose we put a cylinder like thebody of a pump as large as that in theyard and closed well round at the placewhere it is put in so that the steam of theboiling water can get out no way but upthe cylinderthen said lucy how the steamwould rush up through the valve in thepiston what a cloud of steam would comeout at the top stay stay lucy i was going to havetold you that in this piston there is to beno valve it is to be a tight stopper nowsuppose before i let the steam in that ihave the piston down at the bottom of thepump why then before you let in the steamyou must put a great weight to keep thepiston down or it would be thrown up tothe ceiling as the lead in papa's pencilcase wasand i believe said harry yourgreat weight would be thrown throughthe ceiling and would break it to piecesconsider my dear if the small quantityof water that was in papa's elder pencilcase could when turned into steam forcethe lead up to the ceiling and if thesmall quantity of water that was left inthe little brass ball could burst and blowupa whole founder such a quantity ofsteam as this would be able to lift upand blow up this room and all that isin itbut if that is your only way of liftinggi'eat weights and of lifting the house ido not see how it can be usefulpatience lucy suppose that weknow beforehand the weight of whateverwe wish to lift we can calculate andlessen the fire and lessen the steam tillit is just enough and no more than enoughto lift the weight gently up to whateverheight we please suppose now to thetop of the pump then you do no mischiefyou seevery well said lucy if you cancalculate exactly and make no mistakethat is very nicebut now suppose you want to do thismore than once to lift several weightsone after another could you do it youhave the piston and the weight up at thetop and the steam in the cylinder of thepumpi do not know said lucy for idare not take the weight off the piston idare not touch iti would not advise you to touch itindeed said harrythen what can i do said lucythink said harrybut the idea of the steam going oncomingup through the pump frightensme i will tell you what i would do i would put out the fire directly throwwater upon itvery well thought of said harrybut then there is steam in the boileri would throw water into that if icould but i cannot get at it i wouldthrow cold water all over the outside andthat would cool the steam but still there would be the steam inthe body of the pump said harry and i cannot throw water into it becauseof the stopper said lucy welli will throw cold water over it all downthe sides and over the piston at top andcool it and make it as cold as the platepapa held over the urn and colder thenit would condense the steam within andturn it into a very small quantity of waterthen what would happen saidharrythe piston would fall down therewould be nothing to hold it up thesteam would be all goneand what would there be or wouldthere be any thing in the place of thesteam asked harrythere would be nothing but a littlewater there would be a vacuum all butthose drops of water said lucyvery well indeed said harry nowyou have the piston down how will youraise it again i want to have anotherweight brought upthen you know i must light the fireand boil the water again said lucyaye and wait till the cylinder isheated too for till that is heated it willcondense the steam said harrycertainly said lucy you must waittill it is hot but it would be very inconvenientsaid harry to wait while you light thefire and boil the water and so on cannotyou find any better way of condensingthe steam without putting out the fireevery time lucy thought for a few moments andanswered perhaps without putting outthe fire it would do as well if i could butlet cold water into the boiler and into thecylinder of the pumpbut why into the boiler said harrybecause the fresh steam would comeup continually if i did not prevent itsaid lucybut suppose said harry you havecondensed the steam in the cylinder andyou only want the vacuum for an instantor two just to let the piston fall and supposethat for that little time the steamfrom the boiler could be prevented fromcoming in i need not tell you how butit canthen i need not put out the firebut i may condense the steam in thecylinder said lucy that will bemuch more convenient because afterwardsthe steam will be ready to be letin again under the bottom of the pistonif you want another weight to be sent upbut still i do not know how to get thecold water into the body of the pump imean into the cylinder to condense thesteamthe steam said harry is let offinto a separate vessel called from its usea condenser this vessel is surrounded bycold water so that the steam is condensedas soon as it comes into it and is this all the steam enginesaid lucyno my dear lucy it is only thegeneral principle i cannot explain allto you i should only puzzle you thereare different sorts of steam engines inthat invented by mr watt the expansiveforce of the steam is used in differentdegrees to raise the piston and to forceit downi did not know that the steam wasever let in above the piston said lucyyes it is i did not tell you that atfirst lest i should puzzle you and i willnot now tell you exactly how it is doneand there is a great deal more to be explainedabout the ways of making thesteam engine raise weights or water orwork machinery in different directionsours was but an awkward way of raisingweights by putting them on the top of thepiston suppose i want to raise waterfrom a pond you must put a beam outfrom the top of the piston like a scalebeam and with this you might work thepiston of a pump fastened at the other endof this beamvery convenient said lucy andvery simplethere are a great many other contrivancessaid harry and ways ofmaking it turn wheels and pull and pushsideways or in any direction in whichyou want to have work done or force applied but i should tire and puzzle youto death if i were to tell you all at oncepapa took several days to explain to methe parallel motion and the fly wheeland the sun and planet motion and theexcentricoh my dear brother cried lucystopping her ears this would puzzle meto death indeedtherefore my dear i tell you i willnot say one word about any of thesethings today but i will leave your headquite clear as i hope it is in the generalprinciple as papa calls it and here hecomes with his letter in his handmamma is beginning to pour out tea said lucy let us go to herstay one minute lucy said harry now pray when you are called uponto explain to papa be quite steady donot be a coward and fancy that you donot know what you do and do not betoo quick neither above all do not gothe least beyond what you really knowdo not put in any of your its like this vol i ior it's like that when you have nomore to say stopi will said lucy i will not sayone word more than is necessary nor makeone allusion or quotation i will be likeyour own dear menelaus i'll say no morethan just the thing i oughtnow papa will you ask lucy to explainto you what she knows of theprinciple of the steam engine saidharry walking up with her to the teatable with a composed countenancefirst harry said his father imust ask your mother to read this letterfor me and i have a great deal to say toher about itharry sat down with a resigned lookand swallowed tea and eat bread andbutter without hearing one word ofwhat was going on till at last hisfather turned to lucy and said nowmy dear i am ready for you and thesteam enginelucy who had been listening to theletter declared she was afraid that thewhole of the steam engine had gone outof her headin astonishment harry stared at herand in a tone of indignation exclaimedis it possible lucy stay do not frighten me said lucyand perhaps i may get it back againshe did and she recollected all harryhad said to her she distinctly said nomore than just the thing she ought herfather was doubly pleased by the clearnesswith which she made her explanation becauseit showed that harry had understoodwell what had been taught himi promise you both said he thatthe first time i have an opportunity iwill show you a steam engineharry was delighted with this promiseand lucy clapped her hands and addedi know harry that the opportunity willcome soonharry was going to ask her how sheknew this but his attention was takeni off by his father's observing to him thathe had done well to refrain from describingto his sister any of the lesserparts of the machinerylucy said it was not at all difficultto me papa for he brought me up to thesteam engine by degrees and i was quitesurprised when i found i was at it i didnot know what he was about when hebegan with your cold plate and the teaurn and the expansive force of the steamand the condensing the water but i sawplainly afterwards when i found outwhere i was it was just like his way ofleading me blindfold on the gravel walkand taking me to this place and that andi do not know where i am or where he isleading me till he takes the bandage offmy eyes then i am quite surprised atwhat i see before meha ha lucy i thought you couldnot get through without an allusion saidharry but he was well enough pleasedwith this his spirits were so much raisedby this commendation and by the promiseof seeing a steam engine and a steamboatand by lucy's success and his ownthat he could not refrain from saying alittle more than just the thing he oughthe would now go on to tell her the namesof the first second third and fourth inventorsand improvers of the steam enginebut he was fortunately stopped by his father'sgetting up to look for a book inwhich he said he could find a poetic descriptionof the wonders performed by theexpansive force of steamoh i know that book said lucy it is the same harry in which thereare the lines on the barometer and airpumpthe description of the steam enginesaid their father begins by doing honourdue to him whobade with cold streams the quick expansion stopand sunk the immense of vapour to a dropwho was that lucy the inventor of the steam enginethe man who first thought of throwingcold water upon it to condense the steamsaid lucysalary or the marquis of worcesteri do not know which said harry youknow father there have been many disputesfor the honour of this great inventionyes but let these rest for the presentharry said his father salaryis the person alluded to in these linesdo go on reading papa said lucyi like those lines so muchher father continued pressed by the ponderous air the piston fallsresistless sliding through its iron

understand lucy said harryi forget my dear whether i told youthat the steam engine keeps com millsand all sorts of mills goinglucy nodded do not let us interruptpapa i will tell when i do not

stampthe harp the lily and the lion joinand george and britain guard the sterling coin lucy i am sure you cannot understandthis said harryno i was just going to say so harry i waited only till papa came to a full stopbut i know that mona means angleseyher father said that she was right thatthe azure ores allude to copper mines in theisle of anglesey or mona which areworked by the steam engine cupreousmeans of coppers and the ores of copperbeing blueish the poet calls them mona'sazure ores the succeeding lines describemachinery for coining copper first rollingout thick bars of it into plates thin as halfpencethen cutting those plates into circularforms and stamping them with the armsof ireland france and england the harpthe lily and the lion all which is doneby machinery without the hands of menand that machinery is kept at work by themotion and power of a steam engineharry looked triumphant while his fatherspoke of these wonders performed by steam lucy could not conceive how it could doall this her father repeated his promisethat whenever he had an opportunity hewould show her how it is done and lucywhispered again to harry every soon tooperhaps is there no more father is therenothing about the steam boat askedany there is said his father and itis curious that these lines were writtenseveral years before steam boats had beenbrought into use and at a time when it wasscarcely believed by any but a few courageouslyingenious persons that the steamengine could ever be successfully or safelyi employed in driving forward vessels on thewater this prophecy at the time it wasmade most people thought merely poetical and instead of expecting that it would besoon accomplished it was thought that itwould never be effected soon shall thy arm unconquer'd steam afardrag the slow barge or drive the rapid car the slow barge now goes as fast asyou please said harry the rapid caristo come and i dare say that will be accomplishedsoon papa do not you think itwill and oh father read this here issomething about a flying chariot which wedid not hear or on idewaving winds expanded bearthe flying chariot through the fields of air his father had purposely omitted to readthese and prudently declined giving hisopinionharry became silent and thoughtful forsome minutes but occupied himself withburning a lump of sugar whose amberdrops as fast as they fell and cooled heput into lucy's mouth and when thesugar bason was taken from him he foundnew recreation for his fingers and thoughtsin his mother's tambour needle which hepushed and pulled up and down throughsilk and through paper till she took thatfrom his hand and then he had no resourcebut to lean with both his elbows on herframe and to watch her plying the needlelucy whispered from time to time will not you come and play at travellers'with me but in vain she twitched his elbow itremained fixedmy mother's work is like a chain saidharry link within link loop withinloopyes said lucy it is called chainstitchhe watched the lengthening chainwhich with the quick noise of successfulpricks advanced towards him forminga line from one end of the frame to theother which was accomplished in two minutescounted by the watch then scallopsand leaves pointed and round grewunder her hand nothing too difficult forthe dexterous hooked needleit goes on so easily said harry itseems to do it of itself and do you think you could do itharry as mamma does mamma praylet mm have the needle and tryharry had little doubt that he shouldsucceed if he might be allowed to try becausehe had most carefully observed allhis mother did he had watched her handunder the frame and had seen as he saidhow by a little quick motion she hungthe cotton or silk whichever it was overthe hook of the needle and then pulledboth up together through the muslin exactlythrough the middle of the last linkand then dragged on a new loop with alittle twitch and twist and down againwith the needlewell observed and accurately describedi grant said his mother you are perfectin the theory but now for the practiceshe put the tambour needle into hishand the feeling of which he liked particularlybecause its ivory handle was aslarge as a pencil case and something fitfor a man to holdnow we shall see how the man willwork tambour work said lucy ayedown goes the needle pop through themuslin easily enough but now get it upagain and the silk with it if you pleaseand canharry turned the ivory handle to thisside and to that and leaned it this wayand that way and twisted and doubletwistedthe silk on the hook beneath andtwitched and plucked and pulled in vainand came to pooh and pshaw and do not look at me pray i cannot do itif you look at menor if we do not look at you saidlucyi have done it said he dragging upthe needle by main force and making ahole in the muslin through which hehauled it oh harry what a hole i do not know how it happened saidharry but the needle is up at any rateand the loop with it and i have one linkof the chain what you call one stitch andnow for the next which you see i will dobetterhe tried again but the hole made it impossible he pulled out his first his onlystitch and tried again in a fresh cornernothing ever did try his patience or ashethought nothing ever did try humanpatience so much but by taking thoughthe did get the needle and the loop safethrough this time without tearing themuslin he persevered and in a quarterof an hour had really worked a quarterof an inch of chain all crookeddragged out short and long links of varioussizes sad chainstitch as lucycalled it but still she could not deny that hehad done it his fingers were so hot thathe spread them out to cool and groanedand took breath as his father said a coalporter might do after setting down theheaviest loadhis father next took the needle in handwith a theory as perfect with somewhatmore diffidence but with little better successthere was a knack in it which couldbe learned only by practice but the gentlementalked very learnedly to each otherabout it and agreed that their perfect theoryhad helped would help or should havehelped them very muchbut how wonderfully quickly my motherdoes it said harry do it againmamma pray how can you go on soquickly with the work you think i go on quickly said hismother but all that i could do in a dawcould be done by a machine harry in anhour and by what machine do you think by your dear steam engine this is a usefor it of which you never thought is it possible cried harry can these ms and outs and all thisdelicate work and these pointed leavesbe all done by a steam engine said lucy a huge steam engine said harrymamma how i should like to see it atwork doing the tambour work said lucyperhaps i shall be able to show it toyou my dear said their father and soon whispered lucy to herbrotherwhat can you mean said harry iheard you say ail soon over and overagainmy dear did not you hear the letterand all papa and mamma were sayingabout it said lucynot i said harry you were sitting at the teatable allthe time beside me said lucyvery likely said harry i did nothear a word that was saidwhat could you be thinking of saidlucyi do not know answered harry ofa bell crank i believe when i saw mammapull the bell cord i thought i wouldshow you the bell crank in the passage tomorrowand explain by that the crankmotion in the steam enginehow full your head must be of thissteam engine said lucy and of you lucy my dear i wasthinking of something to show to you thank you said lucy then i willnow tell you all that i heard that you didnot hear the letter was papa's answer tosir something somebody the man thegentleman husband to the lady dio toldof the shipwreck when she called here themorning that i spotted my gown with thedirty water from the pump and pondbut never mind that now said harryget on my dear i want to hear what isto comepapa's letter was to thank that gentlemanfor the trouble he has taken in lookingfora house somewhere a great way off bythe seashoreand why did papa thank him forthat said harrymy dear any you are so slow inunderstanding said lucy the houseis to be for papa and mamma and if thereis but room enough in it for us we areto go with themyou do not say so cried harry startingupright with joyi do say so i heard it with these earsand very good ears they are said lucy and papa told me i might hear hisletter said towards the end of it i hopethere may be two little rooms for harryand lucy their mother and i wish to havethem with ushow kind oh any sort of littlerooms any little dens would do saidharry i could sleep in a drawer inanutshell could not you lucyto be sure said lucy but if theycannot in any way find room for us we areto be left with my uncleoh cried harry uttering somethinglike a groan i hope we shall not be leftwith my uncle though in general i like tobe with him very much but i never wenta journey a long journey and with papaand mamma lucy think how delightfulit would be to see mountains and goup them with my portable barometerand to be by the sea side said lucyi never saw the sea and i shall pick upshells by the sea shore beautiful shellsand seaweed and sea urchins and weshall live in a cottage oh think ofliving in a cottageand we shall see a steam boat and asteam engine cried harry now i understandit all but remember it is notcertain yet that we are to go lucy i willnot think of it any more lest we should bedisappointed at last joy joy joy for you harry joy forbotvof us cried lucy the great blacktrunk and the little black trunk and theseatboxes and the carpet bag are comingdown from the garret to mamma s dressingroompacking up is beginning and weareto gowe but are you certain lucy howdo you know said harry i should notlike to be disappointed my dearwho would said lucy but nodanger my dear harry i heard the answerto papa s letter and it says that there isroom for us only that one of us must beput in a very little closet which can justhold a bed and a chairi do not care how small it is if i canbut be crammed into it cried harrynor do i said lucy i can sleepon a sofa or anywhere so that we mayboth go if we do not both go there will be nojoy said harrybut i tell you we shall both go mammasays she can manage it they are toset out the day after tomorrow at six o'clockin the morning and i asked mammacontinued lucy if i might pack up yourthings and mine today in the little blacktrunk she says i may if i can only sheis afraid i cannot do it well enough but ithink i can bring me directly harry tothe dressing room all the things you wantto take with you and i will get all mine inaminutepresently two great heaps appeared onthe dressingroom floorthere are all my goods said harrypointing to one heap all these must goand here are mine i hope they willall go in said lucy looking doubtfully atthe little black trunk which stood betweenthemharry pressing his hand down on lucy'sheap observed that they could besqueezed almost to nothing cram mythings in any way said he i do notcare how so that they go only makehaste i will go and finish my latin lessonsand be back by the time you areready to lock the trunk ram my thingsany way my dear repeated he as he leftthe roommamma is to see how the trunk ispacked when it is finished said lucyand i must do it wellshe packed and packed and squeezedand crammed and rammed but in vainshe could not get in above half of thesethingsthen she took out of the trunk all shehad put in and by her mother's advicebegan to sort her brother's and her owninto two classes of necessaries and necessariesby this operations her brother'sheap was diminished above twothirds andher own nearly half when harry returnedhe was not at all contented with her arrangementand to satisfy him she gave upseveral of her books and reduced her portionto exactly the same size as hisharry left her to pack the think and thistime having listened to her mother's adviceto lay each thing as she put it in as flat aspossible and to leave no holes or hollowsshe succeeded in putting in all thingsnecessary there was one luxury of herown which she much desired to carry itwas a pasteboard tray that was made forholding shells she emptied out all itscontents that she might fill it with a newcollection from the sea shore to hergreat satisfaction there appeared just roomfor it at the top in the arched lid of thetrunkher mother was called to see how easilyit locked and she examined the packingand pronounced that it was as well doneas could be expected from so young apacker she ran to report her success toharry and to summon him to see hownicely her shell tray lay at the top of all thethings fitting under the arched roof of thetrunk she met him coming up stairs witha huge book as she thought under hisarm he asked eagerly if she had finishedpacking the trunk quite finished said she come andlook at it and you shall lock it yourselfharry looked disappointed and said thathe was very sorry the trunk was quite fullbecause he had found something else to putin which he wished particularly to carrywith him and his father had just told himthat it must not go loose in the carriagewhat is it said lucy fetch it ifit is not very large perhaps i can squeezeit mharry half ashamed to ask the questionsaid could you get in what i havehere under my arm this immense quarto book harryimpossible cried lucy it is as largeas half the whole trunkit is only a false book my dear saidharryfalse or true that does not make itless said lucybut as it opens said harry and hasan almost empty inside it will hold a greatquantity it will take up scarcely anyroom in the trunk only the thickness of itsown sides and they are of very thin woodcovered with paper do my dear lucytry if you can get it in it is a cameraobscura which my uncle has just given tome indeed said lucy well my deari will try my very bestbut on opening the false book she observedthat it was not nearly empty thatthere was some apparatus with inside of itwhich took up a gieat deal of room shesaw especially a glass which she wasafraid would be broken if she put anythingwith inside he urged her howeverto try if it were packed with soft thingssuch as her frocks all would be safe ifwe can but carry the camera obscura withus said he when we get to any prettycountry and to the cottage by the sea sidewe shall see such beautiful landscapes init and the boats and ships sailing oh dolucy contrive to carry iti will give up my shell tray criedlucy sand then i can make room for itperhapsthere is a dear good girl said harryshe ran and he followed her to thetrunk he saw how nicely the tray fittedand he saw her take it out and put itquite away he heard a little sigh as shelocked the closet door upon it after puttingit out of sightmy dear lucy said he i cannotbear that you should give up your tray idare say you wish to carry that and yourshells as much as i wish for my cameraobscuranever mind said lucybut i do mind and the more becauseyou do not said harrybut i will tell you why you need notcare so much harry said lucy i canvol i kmake another tray of pasteboard easilywhen we get to our journey's end and thatwill be time enough for my shells at thesea shore but you harry could not makea camera obscuraevery true said harry thank youbut you have all to unpack which youhad packed so neatlynever mind repeated lucy if ican but get it inyou need not unpack to the bottomstop my dear said harry the cameraobscura is only about onethird of the depthof the trunkin it went and there was a little spaceat its ends and beyond its breadth intowhich things could be crammed and shouldbe crammed as harry observed to keep ittight the greatest trial of lucy's patiencewas his standing by all the time shewas repacking advising all the while andsaying as she put in each thing thatwill not go there or this would fitbetter c after she had to the best ofher skill repacked the trunk there remainedon the floor a new jacket andtrowsers of harry's the jacket too wascovered in front with innumerable hardsugarloved shaped buttons which tookup a terrible quantity of room and whichcould not be compressed harry wouldhave found an easy remedy by leavingjacket and trowsers and all behind hethought he could do perfectly well withoutthem so did not his mother upon appealto her she decided that they mustgo what was to be done harry thoughit would give lucy a great deal of troublethought he saw how it could be managedi do not mind the trouble said lucyif i can succeed at last but i think it isreally downright impossible to get moreinto that trunk without breaking the hingesin squeezing it downharry suggested that if lucy wouldunpack the whole trunk and put thecamera obscura at the bottom perhaps shecould get in more because his jacket withits hard buttons might then lie at the topas her tray had lain under the curve of thektop of the trunk by having the flat boxuppermost some of that space he thoughtwas lostlucy was not quite clear that he wasright but however she in a most obligingmanner began to unpack the trunkagain and said she would try it his wayall of any age who have a good opinionof their own powers of packing and whohas not will give lucy more credit forthis than for all the rest she gave up herown opinion and repacked upon her brother'ssuggestion with as much zeal andalacrity as if it had been an idea of herown we are happy to state that thistime she succeeded in putting in what wasrequired camera obscura jacket trowsersand all to harry's joy and admirationher mother was pleased my dear little girl said she i amglad to see not only that you are goodnaturedto your brother of that i did notdoubt but i am glad to perceive thatyou are goodhumoured too good temperis necessary even to the most goodnaturedpeople i have often seen goodnaturedpeople more ready to make greatsacrifices than little ones for their friends but the little ones are most frequentlywanted especially from women almostevery day of their lives and if theymake these in a good humoured obligingmanner as you lucy did just nowthey will be beloved and as far as theycan will make the friends they live withhappyyes mamma said lucy as you doyou came into my head when i was unpackingthe trunk for harry i recollectedyour unpacking the great trunk one nightat coventry when the maid was out andyou were tired to death and aunt pierrepointwanted something which she saidwas at the bottom of the tank and it wasnot there after all mamma i recollectanother thing one day when you gave upgoing to warwick castle which i know youwished very much to see well mammaon this journey which we are going to takeyou shall see that if i have any trials iwill be as good i mean in proportionsaid lucyharry at this moment returned to theroom with their hygrometer and its registerin his hand he told lucy that hethought it would be useless for them tokeep the register while they were travellingas they should change every day todifferent parts of england and it was aregister of the weather in one place thatwas required lucy was glad he hadfound out that it would be useless she wassure that it would have been impossible forthem to keep it while on their journey and she felt relieved from a great responsibilitywhen harry determined to leave itwith their uncle till their return lucyfurther observed that it would also be impossibleshe feared to go on regularlywith harry in his course of scientific lessonsfor which she was really sorry thoughthe pleasures of travelling she acknowledgedmight make up for this interruptionyes said harry that is true wemust give up our regular lessons till wecome back but as papa has just beentelling me it will do us both a great dealof good and me in particular to see newthingsdelightful said lucy and thankyou papa and thank you mamma forthinking of such a pleasant way of doingus goodat six o'clock in the morning harry andlucy were seated opposite to their fatherand mother in an open carriage bagsbooks parcels nicely packed in and harry'sportable barometer snug beside himdrive onthe young travellers stood holding bysomething no doubt according to the everrepeated and nevertobe toooftenrepeatedcounsel they looked from side to sideas they passed bidding goodbye to eachwell known object half sorry to leave homeyet glad to go on to something new itwas a fine morning the sun shining theair fresh andttherb tree fruit and flowerglittering with dewtheir way led through a lane the hedgeson each side full of honeysuckles withwhite and pink bind weed straggling aboveabout and underneath the ground underthe hedges was covered with wild flowersof many colours abundance of that mostdelicate weed if weed it should be calledwhich paints the banks with blue wellknown to all the world by one name orother to the unlearned as speedwell to thelearned as veronica chancery there wasalso abundance of that erect plant with itsspire of crimson bells spotted or plain bypeasants foxgloves by botanists digitaliscalled valued by the old as a cure for thedropsy and loved by the young for theloud pop pop pop which in skilfulhands can be made by its flowers harryasked lucy if she knew why the foxgloveis called digitalisno said lucy whybecause digit ale is the latin for afinger of a glove said harryand the shape of these bells is verylike the finger of a glove said lucy butwhybglove foxes do not wear glovestheir father said that perhaps it mighthave been called so from growing in thehaunts of foxeswhen they came to the end of the laneand the road opened to the view of freshlymown meadows and extensive com fieldslucy exclaimedlook look harry at the gossamerglittering in the sun all over that field asfar as we can see do you see it weavingup and down with every breath of windpray mamma look at this immense cobwebnet all spangled with dew is it notbeautiful most beautiful harryharry answered eyes but it was ayesuttered in a cold tone which did not satisfylucy yet he looked at the gossamerearnestly but he was always more curiousabout the causes of whatever he sawthan pleased by their appearance whilek lucy had been admiring the glitteringfloating waving net harry had been consideringhow or by what this net wasmade lucy said that in her favouritebook of insects and in other books shehad read something about gossamer hebegged she would tell him all she knewof it directlyand as fast as she could she told himthat all these shining threads are madeby a very small insect the garden spiderwho like other spiders can throw out fromtheir bodies a sort of glutinous substancewhich hardens in the air some say thatthe spider leaves the threads behind himas he darts through the air in search offood others say that he has the powerof throwing it out before him and that itcatches upon the blades of grass or on therough edges of leaves and bushes and thenbeing pulled tight by the animal forms asit were a bridge or road in the air forhim to pass from place to place he hasbeen called by some people the flyingdialogues on entomology trees cyclopediaspider and the threads are called airthreads and sometimes these are seenfloating over head and sometimes they areborne down by the weight of the dew andthen caught on the bushes harry asked iflucy ever saw the spider throw out or leavebehind him these air threadsshe had not seen it herself but sheremembered that one man in particularwho wrote about the flying spider declaredthat he one day saw him throwout from his body this substance and sawhim afterwards mount and ride awayupon itexact harry was preparing to questionwhether the flying spider flew or crept orrode walked or darted upon the gossameror whether he moved of his own free willor was blown or borne away by the windbut lucy too quick for his questionshastened to tell him something more thatshe had read of another insect called thesilk spider who spins silk which is almostas fine some say finer than that of thesilk worm a pair of stockings were actuallymade of the spidersilk they werepresented as lucy assured him to thefrench academy of sciences and weremuch admired harry's attention becamemore respectful when he heard of theacademy of sciencesi was thinking said he that greatuse might be made of all that gossamer ifit could be spun and woventhat has been thought of often saidlucy people at the time the stockingswere made hoped that the spider woulddo as well as the silkworm and they setthe spiders at work in paper cases madeon purpose but after they had been keptmany months spinning in their paper cellstheir work was measured and it wasfound that nearly three hundred pf thehardest working spiders cannot produceas much silk in the same time as one goodactive silk wormstill harry contended that since thereare so many spiders the great numbersmight make up for the little they do andas we have them always ready how muchbetter it would be to set them properly towork than to brush them and theircobwebs away or to crush them todeathto this lucy replied that the commonhouse spider who is or ought to bebrushed away is not the silk spinner thatthe silk spinners were not as common asharry imagined besides many faultscontinued she are found with their wayof working they break their threads orspin them only in short pieces so thattheir silk cannot be wound it can only bespun and the reeling takes off its lustrethis want of lustre was complained of inthe famous pair of spidersilk stockingspresented to the french academy onthe contrary the silk worm spins her silkwithout breaking she winds it round andround into cocoons which can be easilyunwound by a careful person whatlength harry do you think the silk wormcan spin without breaking harry was no judge of spinning butsince he must guess he would say aboutas long as the field over which the gossamerspread perhaps about a quarterof a milehe did not think it possible but he saidit on purpose to guess something provokinglybeyond what he supposed any silkwormcould doa quarter of a mile repeated lucythat is a good large guess but you mustknow that a silkworm can spin withoutbreaking as much as when unwound is sixmiles long and if she is not lazy can dothis in nine days believe it or notharry as you please but i assure you itis true and what spider ever did asmuchharry looked as if he wished to urgesomething more in favour of the spidersbut had nothing else to say except thatstill he did not doubt that some waywould be invented of making them usefuloh my dear exclaimed lucy iforget my very best argument spiderscan never work together like good silkwormsbecause they quarrel and fightand eat up one another my insect booksays that of i do not know how manyabove forty or fifty that were shut uptogether in one room with plenty of fliesand pith of quills and all the delicaciesthey like only two of them were at theend of some days found alive and youknow it would be impossible to give eachof them a separate house so there is anend of the matteran end of the matter indeed saidharry i should never have thought ofhaving any thing to do with them if youhad told me at first that they eat one anotherwell lucy continued harrythanks to you and your insect bookswe have had a great deal of diversion outof that field of gossameri feel much more pleasure in lookingat things said lucy when i knowsomething about them even if it is everso littleand then there is the hope of tjwgrand thing that we are to see by and bysaid harry papa when do you thinkwe shall see a steam engine very soon my dear said his fatherwe are now in lancashire where thereare many manufactories in which the machineryis worked by steam engines ihope that in the town in which we are tobreakfast i shall be able to show youthe grand thing as you call it harryto day this morning exclaimedlucyharry in grave delight rose from hisseat to return his very best thanks andin an uncommonly emphatic tone beganwith i am very much obliged to you indeed fatherbut while he was pronouncing this inhis sober manner a branch of a tree underwhich they were going caught his hatand candied it off a little thing couldmake lucy laugh before breakfast whenshe was weak and hungry and long afterthe hat had been regained and replacedand after the accident was forgotten bytheir father and mother who were quietlyreading lucy shook with inextinguishablelaughter even till they came in sightof the town where they were to breakfastafter breakfast they walked with theirfather and mother through the town tothe place where they were to see a steamengine a variety of objects caught lucy'sattention as they walked through the busystreets but harry was so intent uponwhat he expected to see at the end of hiswalk that he did not look either to theright or the left as he passedmuch as his expectations had beenraised he was not disappointed when hecame to the reality the ease and silencewith which the huge beam of the steamengine moved up and down struck himwith admiration and he stood for sometimesatisfied with watching its uniformmotion next he enjoyed the pleasureof recognizing each part of the great machinerythat he had seen in the engravingswhich he had studied and of whichhe had understood the descriptionslucy could not immediately comprehendwhat she saw she could not extendher ideas from the small scale of theengravings to the great size of the machinewhich she now beheld anotherdifficulty occurred she could not at oneview take in all the parts she did notknow where to look for the boiler and thecylinder and all the innumerable small'pipes puzzled her however with herfather's assistance she by degrees madeout the principal parts as they were seenin different stages of the building for allcould not be seen at oncegoodnatured harry delayed to gratifyhis own curiosity till lucy was quite clearin every thing she wished to understand then he began to question his father hewanted to know what work this steamenginewas doing he heard some soundslike the working of machinery and hewished to see what was doing theguide who had admitted them nowthrew open a door and they saw a verylargeapartment full of whirling whirringmachinery rows of spindles full ofcotton like the spindles of a spinningwheelstanding upright in frames whichreached nearly across the room eachspindle being supplied by a long line ofuntwisted cotton from spools or bobbinsabove between each row stood a womanor child watching the work andkeeping the machinery cleanthis is one of arkwright's cottonmills said the guide all this machineryis kept at work by this steamengine and two other rooms full ofcottonframes which you may see if youplease above and below stairslucy uttered an exclamation of surpriseharry was silent with admirationturning back towards the steam enginehe looked about to find where and howthe motion was communicated from theengine to the spinning machinery hisfather who guessed what he was lookingfor showed him where the shaft was carriedthrough the wallharry had once seen a cotton manufactorylong ago but he had only aconfused remembrance of whirling spoolsand noise and dust here as he observedthere was scarcely any dust andbut little noise he was easier to examineand anxious to understand all he sawbut while he was watching them thequick motion of the spinning spindlessuddenly ceased and looking back tothe steam engine he saw the huge beamdescending with a soft seemingly expiringmotionwhat is the matter cried harrynothing master answered the guidesmiling at his alarm nothing but thatit is our dinner time we stop the engineand all the machines leave off workingfor an hour till we come back andset the engine going againand is it possible that the steamengineand all these machines can bestopped so soon and so easily criedharrythe man pleased by the great interestwhich he saw that harry felt showedhim how the whole was stopped byclosing the valves of the cylinder andhow the steam was let off after the enginehad been stoppedthe women and children were nowclearing out of the large room to go totheir dinners and in a few minutes theapartment was emptied of human creaturesand all was rest and silence harrylooked blank he was afraid that heshould not see hear or learn any thingmore and he told lucy he thought itvery unlucky that they had come at theworkmen's hour of dinner but on thecontrary this proved a happy circumstance for their father asked and obtainedpermission to stay during thisquiet hour in the cotton mill and hemade use of this time to explain it andto give them some account of the beginningand progress of the invention and ofits improvementprobably all spinning said he wasoriginally done as it is now in the eastand in some of the southern parts ofeurope by holding in the left hand somethinglike a distaff with the material tobe spun wrapped round it with the righthand the spinner draws out the fibres ofthis material whatever it may be fromthe distaff as in common spinning it istwisted by a spool or spindle hanging atthe end of the thread the spool beingpreviously twirled by the finger and thumbwhen the motion ceases or diminishes soas not to be sufficient to twist the threadwhat is spun is wound upon the spool andthe twirling is renewed this is a simplebut tedious mode of spinning by degreesit was improved and that ingenious contrivancethe spinningwheel such as thatwith which you are well acquainted lucywas brought into use in england for spinningflax for spinning wool you know adifferent sort of machine is usedyes said lacy i recollect the largehigh wheel with which i saw a womanspinning wool now let us go on to the spinning ofcotton said her father and the machineryfor that purpose to understand andfollow the history of any invention the firstthing necessary is to have a clear idea ofwhat is required to be done and of thedifficulties that are to be conquered whencotton is taken out of the bale or largeparcel in which it is brought from the indiesit is generally in hard lumps sometimesstringy to prepare it for cardingit is beaten with sticks to loosen it otherwiseit would break or spoil the teethof the cards it is then carded the soleobject of which is to separate all the fibresfrom each other cards something like thoseyou have seen used in carding commonwool are employed for this purpose thecotton is taken from the card in the formof a roll or tail of about a foot long formerlyin the old way of spinning the nextoperation was to attach the end of this rollto a wooden spindle placed horizontallywhich could be turned round by a largewheel the spinner gave the wheel atwirl and immediately carrying back herhand in which she held the other end ofthe roll the cotton was lengthened supposefrom one foot to five and at thesame time it was twisted the direction inwhich the hand moved had always a certaininclination to the spindle so that thethread might slip off over the end of thespindle at every revolution by thismeans it is twisted yes said lucy i understand this i have seen it in spinning common woolvery well this is called longwheelspinning continued her father but itoccurred to a poor weaver of the name ofhargrave that he could improve this methodas but little strength was employedin drawing out the cotton thread or inturning the spindle which twisted it heperceived that if one woman had ten pairof hands and ten spindles and could movethem at once in the proper direction indrawing out the cotton thread she couldspin ten times as much in the sametime papa interrupted lucy if the womanhad had a hundred spindles and ahundred hands like briareus she mighthave spun a hundred times as much not unless she had known how to useher hundred hands said her father handswithout head would do little but nowwithout talking of briareus how do youthink one head contrived to supply theplace of many hands hargrave's difficultywas to hold fast and draw out many threadsat once keeping them separate and pullingthem evenly while the spindles weretwisting them to accomplish this purposehe took two slips of wood and cuttheir edges so that they could lie close togetherlike the edges of a parallel rulersaid lucy yes said her father and betweenthe edges of these he held fast the ends ofthe several rolls of cotton wool whichvol i li were to be drawn out and twisted theother ends of the rolls of course you knowwere fastened on the spindles one on each and after they had been drawn out andtwisted the motion of the spindles continuingthe thread was wound round uponthem now suppose the spindles to besetin motion and that while they are turninghe draws his ruler back then you seeeach roll of cotton would be drawn outand twisted at once as if each were spunby a separate handi see said lucy at least i understand there are some contrivances necessaryin doing this of which i will notdescribe to you all the particulars lest ishould puzzle you added her father thank you papa said lucy buthow did the man set the spindles in motionyou said suppose they were turningbut you did not tell us howhe placed the spindles perpendicularlyside by side in a row eight ithink he tried at first and he set them inmotion by means of the large wheel orloig wheel as they call it which his wifeused in spinning wool so that they shouldall move at once the wheel had a handlewhich was turned by his wife whilst theruler which held the cotton roving wasdrawn back and they were as he had expectedpulled out and twisted at the sametime how happy he must have been criedharry when he first saw it do whenhe saw the eight threads drawn out andthe spindles spinning them all at once how i should like to have been him at thatinstant i should have liked to have been inhis wife's place at that instant said lucyhow happy she must have been and hischildren if they were standing by lookingat it so it succeeded perfectly not so fast lucy my dear it succeededfor so much but far from perfectlysaid her father his first was but avery rude machine and he had much difficultyin bringing it to a state fit for working then he advanced from eight to tentwenty eighty spindles and he improvedhis machine so that it was brought intocommon use and he called it a spinningjennya spinning jenny very rightcried lucy i suppose his vsife's namewas jenny i hope he made a great dealof money poor man to support his family i wonder how he came first to thinkof this invention said harryit is said answered his father buti am not sure that it is true that the firstidea of it was suggested to hargrave byan accident a number of young peoplewere one day assembled at his house atthe hour usually allotted for dinner theywere at play and they by chance overturnedthe wheel at which hargrave's wifewas spinning wool the thread remainedin her hand and the spindle was then perpendicularand the wheel horizontal thewheel being prevented by the frame workfrom touching the ground it continued toturn round with the motion which had beengiven to it and kept the spindle in motionhargrave's attention was fixed upon it andit is said that he uttered exclamations ofdelight and again and again set the wheelin motion while it lay on the floor andstood looking at it a long time the bystandersthinking that he did so only fromidleness aye but he was not idle said harry he was at work inventing at that moment but how did the overturning of thewheel help him of that part of the story i am notclear answered harry's father it is saidthat hargrave had made attempts to spinwith two spindles with the common wheelfor spinning wool and that he had tried touse his left hand as well as his right indrawing out the thread but that he hadalways found this attempt ineffectual onaccount of the horizontal position of thespindles but when he observed themstanding perpendicularly in the overturnedwheel he saw this difficulty obviated andhe thought of so placing his spindlesso then cried lucy his inventionwas made by accident by the lucky accidentof the overturning that spinning wheelhow often and how many inventions aremade by accidentno said her father inventions arenever made by accident to invent is tocombine or put things together for a particularpurpose this which requiresthought cannot be done by mere chance though accident may and often does suggestthe first hint of an invention to anobserving mind or to a mind intent uponaccomplishing a particular purpose anddiscovers the means that may be used as in this instance was the case withhargrave how many people have seenspinning wheels overturned without everinventing a spinning jenny but nowlet me go on to tell you the next improvementthat was made in cotton spinning what did not the spinning jenniesdo it all perfectly said lucy no no lucy said her father youmust not be in such a hurry we cannotcome to perfection so soon the spinningjennies did only part of what was wantedthe cottonthread spun by the jenny wasfound to be rough spongy and weak itcould be used only for the woof in weavingcotton the warp could not be made ofit the warp was then made of linenthreadswhich were strong and smoothfrom what did this defect in the cottonspun by the spinning jenny arisefrom the fibres of the cotton not beinglaid smooth and parallel to each otherwhileit was drawn out and twisting inspinning by hand lucy you recollect seeingthe spinner not only draw the threadout but press and move it at the same timebetween her finger and thumb thissmoothed the fibres of the cotton andkept them parallel with each other nowthis was wanting in the spinning jennythe motion of the hand in drawing outthe thread was well imitated by the rulersor clasps which holding it fast whendrawn back answered the same purpose but the motion of the spinner's finger andthumb and the effect produced by it wasto be suppliedhow did hargrave do that saidharryhe did not do it answered harry sfather it was accomplished by anotherperson mr arkwright who like hargravewas originally a poor and illiterateman but who had the habit of observationand the power of inventionwell how did arkwright do it saidharry eagerly by passing the cotton between rollerssaid his father by passing it successivelybetween three pair of rollers placednear each other the upper roller of eachpair is pressed down with different weightsthe first pair of rollers through which thecotton is pressed and passed turns slowly the second faster and the third morequickly each with a steady motion nowsuppose harry that the last pair of rollersmoved eight times as fast as the first pairthen eight times more length of cottonwould pass between that pair of rollersthan what had passed between the firstpair consequently the same quantity wouldbe drawn out to eight times the length andeight times the finenessvery ingenious said harry i wonderhow arkwright came to think of passingthe cotton between rollersit is said harry replied his fatherthat arkwright had had frequent opportunitiesof seeing in iron works iron barsdrawn out by being passed between rollersand he afterwards applied this idea tothe drawing out of cottoni am surprised he ever thought of itsaid harry because the fine fibres ofcotton wool and iron bars are so differentstill there is some likeness saidlucy in the motion of drawing out thethread thinner and thinner and smootherand smoother so you see harry thereis good sometimes in observing likenesseswhat i have said continued theirfather may give you some idea of theeffect of the action of the rollers i shouldlfurther tell you that in the undermost ofeach pair of rollers were cut fine littlegrooves or furrows along the whole of itssurface to roughen it so as to prevent thecotton from slipping the upper rollerswere covered with leather the passingthe cotton iovings between these rollerspressed together as i have described toyou with different weights and movingwith different velocities had the sameeffect upon the cotton as that which is producedby the pressure and motion of thespinner's finger and thumb smoothingdown the loose fibres laying and keepingthem parallel with each other and at thesame time drawing them out so as to makea finer threadso at last said lucy arkwright didby the use of rollers what a woman didat first by the motion of her finger andthumbyes said harry but consider howmuch more was done in the same time inone day perhaps by the rollers than a womancould do in her whole life spinningand how difficult and how very ingeniousit was to imitate by machinery that motionof the finger and thumb and thiswas mr arkwright's great inventionit was said his fatherbut what became of the spinningjennies said harry were they laidaside when arkwright made these improvementsand erected these millsthe spinning jennies are very muchlaid aside i believe said his father inconsequenceof the defects which i mentionedbut for some purposes the cottonthey spin is preferable and for these thejennies are still used since arkwright's time have anygreat improvements been made fathersaid harryno improvement has been made inthe principle of his mode of spinning butmany in the simplicity and the perfectingof the machinery the use of steam andsteam engines instead of water and waterwheelsfor keeping these mills in motionis in many places of great importanceof the various improvements in the detailof the machinery i will only mention oneto you an invention made by a mr samuelcromptonthat's right said harry i am gladpapa always remembers and tells the nameof the inventorsmr crompton observed and joinedtogether much that was essentially usefulin hargrave's spinning jenny and in arkwright'srollers or twist frame and he madea third machine which combined many ofthe advantages of the former two andwhich is preferred for spinning fine cottonbut is inferior in spinning coarse thismachine is called the mule should like to see the mule saidharrybut you cannot see and understandevery thing at once said his father hear the workmen coming from dinnersaid lucynow we shall see this cottonmill ofarkwright's at work said harrythe guide coming in at this momentand hearing the last words harry said andthe name of arkwright began to speak ofthe immense fortune which sir richard hadmade by his inventions and improvementssir richard interrupted hairyhow did he grow into sir richardthe king conferred upon him the honourof knighthood answered the workmanand he went on speaking of the finehouses and estates sir richard arkwrightand his descendants have purchaseddid you ever hear sir said he ofthe birthday present which sir richardsonmade to each of his six sons eachfound on his table on the morning of hisbirthday twenty thousand poundstwenty thousand pounds six timestwenty said lucy that is one hundredand twenty thousand pounds what asum and all the consequence of one man'sinvention said harryand industry and perseverance saidhis father arkwright had great difficultiesto struggle with not only in perfectinghis contrivance but in reducing itto practice and in establishing his right tothe inventionthe workmen were by this time pouringinto the room men women and childrenand the machinery was set agoing again inaminute or two and all were busy evenlucy as well as harry had some idea ofwhat was doing they knew the use ofthe spindles and of the cylinders withoutbeing perplexed by the smaller partsof the machinery they had a completeview of each process that the cottonwoolundergoes after it is taken out of itspod till it is manufactured into the finestcottonas they were leaving one of the roomsthe guide showed them a heap of hanks orskeins of cotton yarn all which as he toldthem had been spun by the mule from asingle pound of fine cottonthere are here three hundred andfifty hanks said he and each hankwould measure eight hundred and fortyyards and the whole if stretched outwould make a thread one hundred andsixtyseven miles in length one hundred and sixty seven milesrepeated lucy what would your flyingspiders say to this harryor your silkworms lucy saidharry i think your good active best ofsilkworms never spun more than a silkthe length of six milesat any rate said lucy men andwomen beat spiders and silkworms bothin spinningher father observed that the properobject of comparison between rival spinnersis not the length of the thread butthe fineness and i apprehend saidhe that either a silkworm or spiders'thread is as fine as one fibre of cottonwool and the finest thread of cotton mustbe composed of many fibres so thatnotwithstanding lucy's exultation in thesuperiority of men and women spinnersover worms and spiders harry was compelledto give judgment in favour of theanimals but their superiority is owing only toinstinct and ours to ingenuity and reasonyou know harry said lucy it is nomerit of theirs that they have their materialsprepared for them better than wehavehere the debate about the spiders andsilkworms was interrupted by the entranceof a gentleman who was the principalproprietor of the cotton manufactoryand the conversation turned upon the prodigioussale of cotton goods and muslinin different parts of the world especiallyin englandyou are aware madam said heturning to lucy's mother that muslinwere formerly all made in india and thatit is only thirty or forty years since wefirst attempted to make them in englandand not till within these few years that wehave brought them to their present perfectionlucy's mother was well aware of this she said she remembered when she was achild seeing some of the first muslin madein england and that it was coarse andrough and looked ill and wore ill andthat no one then thought english couldever equal indian muslin but now it isdifficult for the nicest eye to detect the differencein the appearance and in the wearing they are as good if not betterharry's father turned to him and whispered if you put me in mind i will tellyou some other time by what ingenious andbold contrivance that roughness in thefirst english muslin of which your mothercomplained was afterwards preventedthe gentleman continued speaking andwhen harry heard his voice again he wastelling of the immense quantity and valueof the muslin now made in england andscotlandall this we owe said he to ourusing ingenious machinery in these countriesinstead of doing all by the labourof men's hands as in india perhaps youare not yet aware sir said he turningto harry's father of the magnitude ofthe cotton manufacture ita machineryearns for england one thousand poundsevery working hour forty thousandpounds weight of cotton wool is spun andin three minutes the length of the threadspun would more than circumscribe thewhole earthas this was said they were passingthrough an apartment where lucy saw amachine for winding the pretty little ballsof cotton she wished to stay to look at it oh papa may i not look at thisbut her father answered no mydear you have seen and heard enough quite enough if you were to see moreyou would confuse what i hope is nowclear in your heads come awayin the evening lucy acknowledged thatshe was rather tired and was glad to restand to stay with her mother who did notwish to go out again but harry boastingthat he was as fresh as ever was proudto be allowed to accompany his father whowas going to walk out to see the townafter passing through several streetsthey came to a broad public walk on ahigh terrace shaded with trees fromwhence looking back they had a fineview of the town by the red light of thesetting sun which beautifully illuminatedseveral windows especially those of agothic church as harry was returningthrough the streets he regretted that lucyhad not been with them and he asked hisfather whether they were to go avvay fromthis town early in the morning or if hewould stay another day his father whoperhaps was thinking of something elseanswered in an absent manner i do notknow my dear that will depend uponcircumstancesharry was considering as he trudgedon what could be meant by that willdepend upon circumstances when onturning the corner of the street his thoughtswere stopped and his eyes struck with asudden blaze of lights gas lights harry'sadmiration lasted in silence the wholelength of the street when turning intoanother still more bright he exclaimedit is almost as light as day fatherwhat kind of lights are these and of whatare they made his father told him that they werecalled gas lights and that they were madeof gas obtained from coalharry asked how is gas differentfrom other flame of candle or fire his father told him that all flame is gasset on fire in a common fire in a candleor lamp what you see and call flame isgas which when set on fire continues toflame when exposed to the airharry asked how is gas got out ofcoalhis father told him by the coalbeing strongly heated in iron vessels calledretorts which have but one opening for thegas to escape from into the reservoir whereit is preservedharry next inquired how the gas getsfrom the reservoir to the small pipes soas to light all the houses in the streetwhere he saw gas flaming at the windowssuppose a tumbler to be inverted in abason of water said his father youknow that as there is air with inside of thetumbler that air will prevent it from sinkingin the watercertainly said harrybut you may put weight upon thetumbler till you compress the air in theinside and then the water will first rise tosupply the place of the compressed air andwhat will happen afterwards harry i think nothing would happen fatherbut that the water in the bason would continuepressing up the air till it had forcedit into the smallest space possiblevery true to the smallest space towhich it is possible for the water to compressit but the air being compressed itselasticity continually increases till it notonly resists the pressure of the water butdrives out the water from the tumbler andraises it in the surrounding bason nowsuppose one end of a small pipe wereintroduced under the edge of the tumblerwhat would happenthe compressed air would be forcedinto the pipe to be sure said harryand if the pipe were open at theother end said his fatherthe air would go out at the otherend said harryand what would happen to thetumbler said his fatherthe tumbler would continue descendingtill all the air was driven through thepipe answered harryit would so now instead of commonair suppose your tumbler filled withgas exactly the same thing would takeplace this is called a gas holder andthis is the manner in which the gas is continuallyforced from the reservoir throughthe pipesi understand it said harry andi hope you will some time or other showthis experiment to lucy it would bevery easily done with a glass andbason you may show it to her yourselfsaid his fatherdoes the gas light immediately ofitself when it comes into the airno when a person wants to light ithe holds a candle to it and it flames asyou see in the open airsuppose it was to rain or supposethe wind blew strong said harry whatwould become of these lights look atthese flaring without any glass roundthem in the open window in this butcher'sshop would not they be extinguished not by slight rain or wind said hisfather one great advantage of gaslightsis that they are not easily extinguishedby rain or windharry's admiration increasing the morehe heard of their advantages and consideredtheir convenience and beautifulbrightness he wondered why people hadnot thought of using them sooner andhe asked if this gas had never been knownto exist till nowhis father told him that it had beenlong known as what we see in the flameof fire and candles but that till latelyno one had thought of obtaining it inquantities and bringing it into commonuse in the manner in which he now sawit i could tell you harry two curiousanecdotes which i heard from a friendcan you father said harry thenpray do will you be so good as to tellthem to me now if you will mind where you are goingand not run into the gutter said hisfatherabout forty years ago a certain lorddundonald had a patent for making whatis called coat from coal coat is halfburntcoal such as you have seen usedin forges to obtain the coat he halfburnedthe coal and the tar and gas whichwere in the coal were by this process separatedthe coat being his only object thegas was conducted under water many hundredyards in large tunnels in order tocondense the tar and the gas escaped outof a high chimney how it became lightedmy friend said he did not know but oncelighted it continued to burn and theflame illuminated the country for twentymiles roundi wish i had seen it said harryhow grand and beautiful it must havelooked but when people saw this i wonderno one thought directly of making useof the gas and of obtaining it in the sameway for lampsit is the more surprising said hisfather because it was in fact a gas apparatuslike that at present used only thegas was suffered to escape and waste itselfbut father said harry what wasthe other anecdote long before this lord dundonald stime there was a chemist whose name ido not recollect who made gas from coaland stored it in bladders and frequentlyvol i mamused his friends by pricking a hole inthe bladder and then applying a light toitthis was portable gas such as peopleare now beginning to use only in a differentcasewell this is more extraordinary still'said harry because that gas in the bladderwas in such a convenient form forcarrying about it is wonderful that neitherhe nor any of his friends who saw it everthought of making use of it for lamps iwish i had been by when he showed thebladder and pricked it and set fire tothe gas father even such a boy asi might have thought of it might noti you might harry said his fatherbut how few men to say nothing of boysobserve what they see any day or everydayor think of what use can be made of it but so striking a thing and so obviousa use said harry what seemsso easy and natural now that it is done true harry the thing was therebefore their eyes but useless because theydid not think of making use of itand for forty years and more saidharryafter a long silence during whichharry stumbled sundry times he exclaimedfather i am thinking not of where you are going saidhis fatherbut i am thinking father that thereare a gieat many other little things whichpeople have not yet observed that maylead to great things if people think ofputting them to useundoubtedly said his father inthis you are very right and father do you think that if itry to observe and consider what use icould put things to i shall ever discoveror invent any thing newharry was here interrupted by stumblingover a walking stick with whicha man whom they met was feeling hisway and which harry had not observedii i wish that man would not poke outhis stick so said harry it nearly threwme downthe man begged his pardon said hewas blind and was forced to grope hisway with his stick harry now beggedhis pardon for running against his stickand guided him across to the next streetand the old man wished him a good nightand said may you never be blind as i am andwhenever you are old may you meet withhelp as i have from youas soon as the blind man had left themharry began to recollect what he was sayingwhen he first met him and he wouldhave resumed the conversation but his fathertold him that he could not talk to himany more now and that he must walk fastfor it was getting late harry trudged onas quickly as he could his father thoughthe must be tired and so he was but hescorned to complainit was late when they reached the inntea had been waiting some time andlucy after struggling to keep herselfawake had fairly given up the point andhad fallen asleep her head resting on herarms which were crossed on the tableshe was so fast asleep that she couldhardly be wakened sufficiently when harrycame in to ask whether he had had a pleasantwalk after swallowing a cup of teawith her eyes half shut she submissivelyobeyed the signal of the chambermaid withbedchamber candles and retired to thatrest which she much wantedharry would stay up to listen to a conversationbetween his father and a postillionfrom which he hoped to discoverwhat would be done in the morning andwhat was meant by that will dependupon circumstances but before he hadmade this out he fell fast asleep across thegreat black trunk where he lay unobservedtill the waiter tumbled over his legs andlet fall a spoon upon his head harrystarted up he had dreamt as he saidthat he had been struck by the beam of asteam engine his mother exhorted himto go and dream in bed she took up acandle to light him on his way but heturned and stood looking at the postillionastonished to see him still standing thereand his father still talking to himmother what an immense time thisman has been standing talking saidharry not above five minutes my dear'replied his motherfive minutes only cried harry ihave been in that time all the way to germanyand back again at a palace magnificentlylighted up with flaming crocusesof gas i asked whose house it was donot you know said the man it is yourfriend the great otto guerick's i was notsurprised that he was living still i only saidi would go and see him but the insideof the palace was like a cottonmill andthere was a great steam engine going onworking away through all the workmenand women and children i went onasking for otto guerick till at last oneguideman said he would show me thesay to otto's laboratory where he wastrying experiments always in his silk nightgownbut the man said the laboratorywas at the top of the house and asked ifi could follow him up high ladders ohyes i said as high as ever he pleased soi went scrambling on after him and if myfoot had slipped i should have gone downdown down i do not know where but ireached the top and a door opened andi heard the rustling of otto guerick'ssilk nightgown and i was just going inwhen that spoon which i thought was thebeam of a steam engine fell upon myhead oh mother i wish it had notfallen it was so provoking to be wakenedat that moment just when i was going intosee otto guerick i wish that i coulddream it over againyou had best sleep again harry mydear said his mother and this timesleep in your bed come said sheshowing him the way through the passageto his bedroom where she put into hishands his nightcap which lucy even inthe depth of her own sleepiness had rememberedto leave ready for himharry slept nine hours without intermissionbut he saw no more of ottoguerick or his gas illuminated mansionhe was still fast asleep when hismother called him during breakfast hisfather and mother talked about the variousnoises they had heard in this inn all nightand by which they had been so much disturbedthat they could not sleep hismother said that a coach had arrived orset out every half hour that she had heardbells and calls hostlers and chambermaidsand waiters running to and fro inthe passages continually and people callingperpetually for their trunks and portmanteausand parcels and bills harry'sfather said that the partition between theirroom and the next was so thin that theycould hear every sound and there was aman in that room who seemed to be pullingoff his boots and throwing them downand throwing wooden legs after them allnightharry and lucy looked at each otherwhen their father and mother talked ofall these noises they were surprised forthey had slept so soundly that they hadnot heard themduring breakfast harry told lucy thatit depended upon circumstances whetherthey were to go on with their journey todayor to stay in this town lucy saidshe was not at all the wiser as she didnot know what circumstances he meanttheir mother told them that it dependedupon a letter which his father expected toreceive by the post to tell him whetherhis friend would return home thisday or not harry's only reason for wishingto stay was that lucy might see thepretty walk he had taken the precedingevening but as it was now raining theycould not walk and he was glad that theywere not to spend the day at the innwhere they had nothing to dowhat shall we see next said lucyas she got into the carriage i like sfoino on to something newm o if you had your choice harry whatwould you wish to see next said lucya mountain said harry who wasfaithful to his old wish for a mountain to measurewith his portable barometer whilehe had been taken up with the cotton manufactoryand the steamengine and the gaslightsthis wish had slept in his mind butit was now awakened with fresh eagernessas they journeyed on he eyed the outlineof every hill on the horizon but he observeda discreet silence upon the subjecteven when lucy exclaimed here's amountain coming for you harry he repliedsoberly so i see my dear but itis not near enough yet i will speak wheni think it is timeat last when they came into derbyshireand into the hilly parts of that countyharry spoke for he thought it was time father here are plenty of mountains will you be so good as to stop the carriageand to let me get out that i may measurethis one which is almost close to us i willnot detain you above twenty minutes motherif you could be so good as to wait in ten minutes i would run up in ten minutesi would be down again may ifatherno harry said his father we cannotstop for you now it would detainus much longer than you imagine youreye deceives you in judging of distancesand of heights to which it is unaccustomedfor your comfort harry added hismother we are going to matlock aplace where you will find yourself surroundedby fine mountains upon whichyou may try your own and your barometer'smeasuring powers at leisure for weshall stay there two or three daysdelightful thought harry thankyou mother said hepresently they entered a narrow butbeautiful valley a stream ran through itand there were hills on each side theirbanks were covered to a great height withtrees of the softest foliage and of variousshades of green tinged here and there withthe brown and yellow colours of autumnabove high above the young featheryplantations and the scrubby brushwoodrose bare whitish rocks sometimesstretching in perpendicular smooth masses sometimes broken in abrupt craggy summitshuge fragments from which had falleninto the river below the river flowedtranquil and placid till when opposed bythese massy fragments it foamed andfrothed against their immoveable sides then separating the waters whirled roundthem in different currents and joiningagain the stream ran on its course sparklingin the sunshine the road now lyingbeside this river brought them soon tothe pretty straggling village of matlockthe morning after their arrival theywent out to walk at a lite distance fromthe hotel where they lodged was a walkup masonhill it was a zigzag path cutthrough a wood of fir trees reaching tothe summit called the heights of abrahamthey went part of the way up this pathand harry was eager to go to the very topbut his mother was not able she said togo quite to the heights of abraham sheand his father and lucy went to see acave in this hill but his father told harrythat he might go on by himself if he likedit to the top of masonhill and take itsheight with his barometer and comparethis with the reputed height which is saidto be about feetharry to lucy's surprise stood hesitatingwith his barometer in his hand insteadof going on with the alacrity she expected what is the matter would you rathercome with us to see the cave said lucyno said harry that is not thethingwhat then said lucy ado youwant me to go with you i should like it but you know mamma said that i must notgo running about everywhere with youhere as i do at home i must stay withmamma but you look afraid to go byyourself added lucy laughingafraid my dear i am not the leastafraid to go by myself anywhere in theworld said harry proudly am notgoing to do any thing wrong what shouldi be afraid ofi do not know said lucy that iswhat i want you to tell me i am surethere is something you do not like or elsewhy do not you set offthere is something i do not likesaid harry that i acknowledge i donot like to meet those people who arethere farther up on the walk what harm will they do you harrysaid his fatherno harm father only i do not like tomeet them because they are strangersbut since as you observed harry youare not going to do any thing wrong youneed not be ashamed i will not sayafraid to meet them said his motherthat is very true mother said harryi know it is very foolish well i willconquer it i will go on by myself addedhe resolutelygo on and prosper then said his father i dare say that those people willnever think about you unless you do somethingto attract their attentionharry walked off as fast as he could nor stopped till he reached the heights ofabraham then he took out his barometerand noted down the height at whichthe mercury stood both in the barometerand thermometer then he went downthe hill and as soon as he had reachedthe bottom he looked at the mercuryagain in each noting down carefullythese heights also finding a retirednook away from the public path he satdown to work at his calculations resolvednot to stir till he had completedthem on his barometer there was engraveda table of the heights at whichthe mercury stands at different elevationscalculated when the atmosphere is at thefreezing point besides this he had takencare to bring with him a certain little book an expeditious method of determining alticontaining an expeditious method ofcalculating altitudes the want of whichhad in his first attempt to measure thechurch prevented his succeeding to his satisfactionnow understanding and followingthe directions contained in thislittle trusty companion to his dear portablebarometer he made his calculationssufficiently accurate to satisfy his consciencehe brought his answer within twofeet of the height which his father hadtold him had been determined by previousmeasurementhe next went to look for the caveit was a large deep dark cavern at thefarther end of which he perceived light and as he advanced he saw the forms ofmen of the guides who held torchesand he heard lucy's voice and the voicesof his father and mother and soon disquietudeswith the new portable mountain barometer with a description of that instrument by sir harryenglefield barta little tract which is or ought to be sold withevery portable barometergushed their figures they were alllooking up at the roof on which theguides with raised torches threw a stronglight from the roof which appeared encrustedall over with yellow earth hungmultitudes of what seemed like earthyicicles of the same colour and of enormousbulkmy dear harry are you there criedlucy i am glad you are come i wasso afraid you would not come in time tosee these are not they beautiful do youknow what they are they are stalactitesand how came they there saidharry and what are they you tell methey are stalactites but that tells me nothingbut their nameit is a good thing in the first placesaid lucy to know the name becausethen we can ask people questions andthen they will know what we are talkingabout she told him all she had justlearned from what she had heard theguides and her father say that thesesstalactites were formed by the wateroozing through the roof of the cavernand depositing as it trickled downs somecalcareous earth which it had dissolvedin its course through the soil and rocksalong and down which it had passedshe believed that these rocks were calcareousor limestone she had furtherheard one of the guides say that somestalactites found in this country becamealmost as hard as stones were of variouscolours and had been polished and madeinto necklaces and different ornamentsthe tides had broken off from the sidesof the cave some of the stalactites andhad given pieces of them to lucy someof these which had been newly formedwere softish and crumbled easily whenpressed between the fingers some werea little harder and crisp cracking ratherthan mouldering when pressed otherswere as hard harry observed as somepetrifaction which he had seen in hisuncle's collection his father told himthat those petrifaction had been formedin the same manner in which these stalactiteswere formed and the guidessaid that they would show him plenty ofpetrifaction and crystals and beautifulspars of different colours for which derbyshireis famouswhile all this was saying lucy's motherwho did not like standing still longin this damp cavern had by gentledegrees alternately drawing lucy on bythe hand and urging harry forward bythe shoulder kept moving onwards tillthey found themselves again at the entranceor the exit of the cave they wereglad to see the daylight to feel the freshwarm air and to tread again on drygroundseveral boys and girls met them intheir way to the hotel with basketsof crystals spars and petrifaction inone basket lucy saw a petrified wigthe guides told her that the people ofmatlock amuse themselves by puttingwigs and different things in these calcareoussprings to have them as they sayconverted into stone such they seemto turn into as no appearance of theoriginal substance is left except the formbut as harry observed it is not that thesubstance turns into stone but that thecalcareous deposition covers it all overand the original substance in time decayingnothing afterwards is left but calcareousstone in another basket lucy sawspars of various colours some of purpleand some of amber of different shadesin rainbow stripes or cloudlike streakssome of these spars were made intohearts and necklaces and boxes andurns and eggs and various trinketslucy's mother told her that she mightchoose any one of these things she likedlucy chose a polished of shadedpurple spar it seemed transparent andlooked as if you could see into it to agreat depth but when lucy tried to openit she found that it did not open of what use then can it be it had a little gold ring at the top of itand was intended to be used as a nettingweight lucy had been long making apurse for her father she was sure thatthe pleasure of using this pretty weightwould encourage her to go on netting itas soon as ever they should come to theend of their journey but how was theegg to be carried her father said hecould not have it rolling about the carriageand the pockets were already fillyoccupied lucy would have been reducedto take a flat heart instead of herbeautiful egg if harry good at needhad not stepped forward and openingwide as he could stretch the mouth ofhis waistcoat pocket bid her put her eggin there where there is plenty andplenty of room added he shrinking inhis stomach to show the ample spacemy dear harry you are very goodsaid lucynot the least said harry ishould be very bad if i did not recollecthow good you were about my cameraobscura which you crammed into thetrunk come drop your egg in here atonce and say no more about itshe dropped it into the pocket but my dear harry it looks as if youhad a great swelling people will starei do not care said harry let themstarethis was indeed as lucy knew a greatproof of harry's affection for in generalhe disliked excessively to be stared atand avoided every thing that could bringupon him such a misfortunebesides added he patting down theegg in his pocket it does not stick outnow more than my ball which i haveoften carried here and nobody evernoticed it except my mother indeednow i have got it into the corner you seeit is not a greater lump than my pockethandkerchief which sticks out as muchon the other side so all's rightbut if you were to tumble down thehard egg might hurt you harryi might hurt it said harry for ishould break it i suppose but my deari never that is hardly ever tumble down and now i have this egg it will make memore careful so say no more about itnow i want to tell you about the heightsof abrahamhe had prudently forborne to speakof his operations while her head hadbeen full of stalactites and spars andwigs she now listened to him with duesympathy and was delighted when heinformed her that his barometer measurementcame right within two feet hisfather congratulated him upon his successwith which he was particularly pleasedbecause it was the consequence of perseverancehe was glad to see that hisson would not be satisfied till he hadrectified his errors and had been as exactas he possibly could this promisedwell for his future progress all the restwas mere child's play very fewuncles said he would have given aportable barometer to a boy of your agei am glad you can prove to him that youhave been able to use his present andthat it has been of service to youharryit was lucky for me said harry that there was nobody by on thoseheights of abraham when i was at mywork and lucky too when i came tothe bottom of the hill that i found a snugplace out of the way of every body wherei made my calculations or else i am surethey would have been all wrong that would have been a pity saidlucy after all your painstherefore it would be a oreat advantageto you harry said his father if you could learn to calculate and tobe able to go on with whatever you aredoing when people are looking at youas well as when you are by yourselfbecause you cannot hope always to bealone when you want to think nor canyou always hope to find snug solitaryplaces for your calculations every commonschoolboy is forced to learn hislesson and to cast up sums without beingdisturbed by strangers all this is easilylearned by practiceaye by practice i dare say saidharryand i will tell you what you can daby your own sense added his father upon every opportunity try to conqueryour dislike to going among strangers andthen you will get over your bashfulnessfather then if you please i will gowith you to day and dine at the publictable instead of staying with my motherand lucyright my boy so you shallwhen dinner time came harry wentalong with his father and as he walkedinto the public room said to himselfi am doing nothing wrong i need notbe ashamed i will not be bashfulstill a mist of confusion came before hiseyes when seated beside his father at avery long table he saw opposite to hima line of strangers and on all sides ofhim strangers he scarcely ventured tolook up at their faces he was seizedvol i nwith one of his fits of the cramp of bashfulnessunder which he sat suffering andstiffened blushing and conscious that hewas blushing scarcely able to answeryes or no thank you when he wasasked what he would have he thoughtthat every body must take him for a fooland this made him feel more uneasy andawkward he scarcely saw or knew whathe was doing he threw down first onething then another first his fork then hisbread in reaching for the fork then thesalt cellar and at last a glass of waterinto his father's plate it was weh it wasno worse his father set the glass upagain sent away his plate and said nothingabout it harry wished he was in hismother's room or under the table or anywherebut where he was his blundersand disasters had more and more provokedhim with himself and he thoughthe had disgraced himself for ever andthat people must think he was a vulgarcreature or a child not fit to dine withmen or gentlemen nor used to dine anywherebut in the nursery his face wasby this time all burning with shame andscarlet up to the roots of his hairwhile he was in this condition the ladywho was sitting beside him asked him ifshe should help him to some oysters hehappened to dislike oysters and he answered no thank you in rather a surlytone and then thinking he had donewrong to answer so gruffly held his plateout and said if you please ma'ambut you have not finished your sweetmeati did not observe that said thelady you do not like sweetmeats andoysters together do you my dear i do not care ma'am thank your saidharryyou are not the young gentlemanare you said the lady whom metthis morning with a barometer in hishand i do not remember meeting youma am said harry but i had a barometerin my handreally i should not have thought younwere the same may i ask what you weredoing with that barometeri cannot explain it to you ma'amnow said harrya gentleman luckily asked her at thismoment to drink a glass of wine and sheturned away from harry and thought nomore about him or her question still hisfather took no notice of him but left himto recover himself by degrees and to findout the truth that people were thinking ofthemselves much more than of him graduallyhe came to the use of his senses andunderstanding so far as to hear and comprehendsomething entertaining which agentleman who sat opposite was relatingas soon as harry became interested in listeningto what this gentleman was sayinghe stiffened looked up moved forwardon his chair forgot his blushes and hisblunders and all his fears of having disgracedhimself in short he forgot himselfaltogetherthe gentleman was giving an accountof the plundering of a vessel which hadbeen stranded on the coast of south walesin st bride's bay it was a transportladen with ordnance stores from americaharry made out that ordnance storeshere meant gunpowder and guns someof the people on the coast saw the signalsof distress which were made by the personson board the vessel but instead ofputting out boats and going to their assistancethese wicked people thought only ofplundering the vessel and carrying awayevery thing they could for themselvesthey assembled on the beach and waitedthere till the ship was driven on shoreand wrecked while the poor people onboardwere trying to save their lives theseplunderers were busy carrying off all theycould from the wreck they boarded heras soon as possible because they knew thatas soon as ever the gentlemen of the countryshould hear that a vessel had beenwrecked they would come to assist thesufferers and to prevent the plunderthe mob made such haste that they gotpossession of their prey and landed a considerablequantity of gunpowder from thestranded vessel many of the plundererswere loaded with as much as they couldcarry while others were struggling fortheir share of the booty as their confederateswere dragging it on the shorein this scene of confusion and in thesestruggles a quantity of the gunpowderwas scattered on the shore and on therocks one of the ringleaders of the mobquarrelling with another who had got possessionof a musket which he wanted tohave for himself seized it and threw itfrom him with violence what happenednone could exactly see as it all passed soquickly but probably the musket hadstruck against a flint a single spark wasenough set fire to the gunpowder whichwas scattered over the rock one explosionafter another was heard onetrain communicated to another and in afew seconds the whole strand and rocksseemed wrapped in fire and smoke manyof the plunderers were killed on the spotothers were dreadfully maimed and diedlingering deaths the man who threw themusket absconded and was never heardof afterwardswhile harry listened to this dreadful buttrue story pity for the shipwrecked peoplewho perished for want of timely assistanceindignation against the wretches whothought only of plundering the wreckwretches such as he could hardly believeto exist horror at the catastrophe an awfulsense of the justice of the punishmentwhich they immediately brought uponthemselves and satisfaction that theygained nothing by their crime altogetherfilled his mind and these successive sentimentsand reflections so absorbed hinthat he completely forgot every thing elseforgot where he was and who was byand all his own little foolish feelingswhat was become of his bashfulness itwas all gone gone off with that superfluousanxiety which he had felt about theopinions the surrounding people mightform of himafter they left matlock the road appeareduninteresting to our travellersbut they had books in the carriage andlucy's mother began to read at first toherself and afterwards to her companionswhen she found any thing that she thoughtwould entertain them here is an account said she of thevarious stinging

an absenttone he seemed to be heartily gladto have this history of the moschettoesfinished and to get rid of them theyhad prevented him from fixing his attentionupon something which he wanted tothink

ableto amuse herself began to point out to hermother every thing or animal she saw onthe road which she thought would lookpretty in drawing look mamma at that woman who iscrossing the field with a

whathe was reading and who was alwayscheerful and sociable put away his bookand looked out of the window joining withlucy and her mother in their diversionpresently he saw an old man and womantrudging together down a lane that led toa wood and he began to sing a favouritesong of lucy's in which she immediatelyjoined there was an old man who lived in a woodas you may plainly seehe said he could do more work in a daythan his wife could do in threewith all my heart the old woman saidif you will me allowyou shall stay at home to dayand i'll go follow the ploughharry turned about and looked muchdiscomfited by the singing and lucysaid join us harry oh join us you knowitbut harry replied only by stopping bothhis ears and hanging again out of thecarriage window further than before thesinging in full glee was continuing whenharry drew in his head and rubbing hishands exclaimed as he threw himself backin his corner i have it i have found it out papa his father did not ask what he hadfound out but went on singingfather said harry will you explainto me now what is meant by a patentor by taking out a patent for an inventioni am singing do not you hear saidhis father go on lucy go on singingwith mewhen they had finished the song harryasked his question again about the patentfor an invention but his father did notlisten to him papa cried harry after eagerlywaitingfor the moment when as he thoughthe could fix his attention i want totell you what i have been thinking of allthis timei do not want to hear it harry saidhis father i cannot turn my mind to whatyou are thinking of i will go on with myown thoughtsso saying his father put himself intoharry's late position hanging over theside of the carriagewell said he at last turning toharry who looked doleful you feel howunpleasant it is not to have people readyto sympathize with you you feel how disagreeableit would be to you if we couldnot turn our thoughts to what you arethinking of when you wish for our attentionharry looking ashamed said that istrue papa i believe i have been all dayvery disagreeable but i did not mean it i was thinking of something that i hopedyou would be pleased with and i did notlike to leave off till i had quite invented itor at least made it as good as couldoh papa said lucy may i speak you ought to be pleased with his going onpersevering through all the noises we madeand every interruption i am sure i couldnot so have fixed my attention lou and your brother my dear lucysaid her father have two opposite faultsand i wish you both to know them thatyou may take care and use your powerover your own minds to cure them yourattention lucy passes too quickly fromone thing to another you are what isisvulgarly called bird witted you shouldendeavour to prevent your mind from flyingoff from one subject to another i encourageyou to fix it as steadily and aslong at a time as you can you are ofsuch an affectionate sympathizing temperthat there is no danger that you shouldnot be ready enough to turn your thoughtsto the pursuits and amusements of otherswhenever it is necessary or agreeableyou harry have acquired the power andhabit of fixing your attention steadily onyour own pursuits but you cannot easilyturn your mind from your own thoughts towhat is going on near you or to whatother people wish you to think of nowconsider that your sister and your motherand i and every body like syrnpalliiy aswell as you do probably and if you acquiredthis unsociable habit of never joiningin what we are donor or beings interestedin what we are saying or hearingyou would become a very disagreeablecompanioni hope i shall not said harry with alook of serious alarm you have perseverance and laudableambition enough continued his father but the danger for you is that you shouldconfine your attention too much to one smallcircle of objects and not enlarge your mindby general observation and knowledge you perceive that i speak to you notas to a foolish child but as to a reasonablecreature who is desirous to improvehimself on this journey you will haveopportunities of curing yourself of thisfault when you are going through anew country look about you observe everythingwhen you are with people whoare talking on subjects that are new to youlisten to what they say much knowledgeand amusement can be gained by the earas well as by the eye ears and no ears might make a good tale as well as eyesand no eyes he did listen the other day papasaid lucy and heard what the gentlemantold about the wreck and the gunpowder harry repeated it to me afterwardsas he was so well rewarded by hearingwhat was entertaining and by yourremembering it so kindly said her father i hope he will continue to attend to conversation if people did not talk so much nonsensegenerally in company sir saidharry i should listen oftenerpick out the sense if you try to doso you will always find some goldengrains of sense even in an ocean of nonsenseand suppose you should not itwill be of use to your own mind to interrupteven by nonsense the course of yourthoughts the mind becomes stupefiedwhen it has thought too long on any onepointtrue said harry so i found todaywhen i was thinking about my measuringwheel when i had thought and thoughtfor a great while i grew quite tired andstupid i could not tell what was the matterwith me i could not invent what i wanted and listening even to the moschettoeswhich i hated at the time did me goodharry is so candid said his motherthat there is really some pleasure in findingfault with himhe was not like those foolish boys whowhen they are told of any fault think onlyhow soon the person who is speaking willhave done that they may get rid of the immediatepain nor was he one of those whothink only of what excuse they can makenor yet was he one of those the most foolishwho grow sulky and sit or stand likestatues feeling all the time as if the nightmareprevented them from stirring it istrue that harry was acquainted with thisdisagreeable sensation arising parly fromshame and partly from pride but hestruggled against it and threw it off assoon as possible lucy what were you doing before allthis began asked harry we were singing the old man inthe wood said lucy and then sheadded in a whisper should you like tosing it again if you would i will beginiti should said he beginshe began harry followed and theirfather immediately joined them theysung but badly but they were all wellpleased with each other and lucy said shewas now quite happythere must be some nonsense mixedwith wisdom now
