the sear and yellowleaf of fashionable notoriety her parties wereill attended she was not invited to those shedestiny wished most to be at and when she went intopublic she found herself slighted and

polishwhich is now the great aim and end of educationto impart edith had not mixed muchin general society but she had been all her lifeaccustomed to do the honours of her father'shouse to many a noble and distinguished guestand to receive in return those marked and peculiarattentions due to the fair and youthful mistressof a noble establishment but now amidstthis plebeian coterie she found herself a personof no consequence whatever compared to missmogg the muffinmaker's daughter so relativea thing is personal importance she was slightlyand civilly sometimes compassionately spoken destinyto

charmswhich render it so fascinating in refined society and i confess the idol appears to me in all itsnative deformity i should imagine it was seldom seen to greateradvantage than in the person of

ribley frequentthough formal invitations were also given tomrs macauley to dine or drink tea at the grove and thus several weeks passed away without anygreater varieties than occasional parties whenmiss mogg always shone forth as the star of theevening destinyedith had all her life been accustomed to mixfreely in gentlemen's society and to receive agreat deal of attention without attaching to it anyof those ideas of love and marriage or even exclusiveadmiration which young ladies are soapt to indulge when they find themselves at alldistinguished beyond the common forms of wellbredindifference she therefore conversedwith gentlemen with the same absence of designand consequent ease of deportment as shewoidd have done with companions of her ownfie and there was a simple quiet refinementin her manner equally remote from prudery asfrom coquetry something of this might alsohave been owing to her affections having beenso exclusively engrossed by one object theseaffections had been deeply wounded and thoughthe wound itself had long since closed it hadbeen succeeded by an insensibility which renderedher alike unconscious of and indifferentto ordinary impressions not even mrs ribleywith all her cold correctness could find faultwith the manners of her niece not that she admiredthem they lacked that formality whichdestiny with her was the criterion of virtue and madeit difficult for her to comprehend how far therecould be purity of heart and sincerity of mindand dignity of behaviour without this her guardianangel to protect the whole although shecoidd not say that edith encouraged the attentionsof charles penshurst she began to suspectthat charles penshurst was rather too particularand unremitting in his attentions to edithat length an sclaircissement took place oneday as the ladies sat in solemn silence at theirwork mr ribley came twaddling into the roomhis wig all awry his eyes goggling his handsshaking and his whole person indicative of greatmental agitation he looked for a minute ortwo as if doubting the evidence of his ownsenses then with a sort of scream burst forth refused miss mogg refused miss mogg three hundred

by remaining where yonare edith till we have finished these frills itis of importance that the frills that are to beworn together should be hemmed together sounded old mogg myself found himquite

it'sall for his own advantage too and she cast alook of cold scrutiny at edith who sat quiteunconscious either of it or of the suspicionswhich were now beginning to be bodied forth inmrs ribley's dull brain can you assign noprobable motive miss malcolm said she forthis extraordinary behaviour of mr penshurst edith looked with such innocent surprise asmight almost have sufficed to answer the

now appearedto be completely dispelled by a note just receivedfrom him declaring his intention of settingout for the continent in a day or two thiswas quite conclusive in her opinion that shehad been for once mistaken in her surmises andshe therefore took the first opportunity ois assuringedith that there appeared not the slightestground for supposing that mr penshurst hadbeen at all influenced by any secret preferencein refusing to pay his addresses to miss moggmr ribley was too goodnatured to retain hisdispleasure which indeed scarcely ever amountdestinyed to anger however strongly he might expresshis disappointment and he therefore hastenedto town the following morning to be reconciledto his somewhat spoiled nephew before he tookhis departure edith felt the loss she had sustainedin an agreeable companion and the dullne and vacuity that reigned in the emilywould have been at times almost too much forher spirit to sustain had it sought support inoutward things but she had that within whichpasseth show even the ornament of a meekand quiet spirits seeking not its own in thethings of this world for of all those which hadonce been hers she was now bereft the tenderestties of nature d

afforded by theobjects that met their view amongst the manycloselyembowered villas which lay on everybestint side there chanced to be one which more particularlyattracted edith's attention from

projectedpionic till they returned home and edith hadsome difficulty in evading his request that shewould make immediate application for an orderto carry it into effect but he seemed likely tobe gratified sooner than he expected for onreaching home she found the following notewhich had been delivered in her absence my dear edith i have just heard from mamma you are intown and wish for a card

imposture with whichits streets abound at least as far as her limitedmeans admitted her large pockets were dailyreplenished with halfpence for the beggars herroom was filed with trash bought as

need not be feared thistime my dear for i'll let nobody dwell therethat is any ways disagreeable to you but vmas sure as i'm alive you would not object tohim if you but saw him however i'm notgoing to say black or white about him for iknow very well that you rather misdoubt menow to be sure i have been sometimes mistakenas well as my neighbours and i'll not saybut what i have been a little unfortunate in mygood opinions but for all that i have my sensesstill for which i am very thankful even thoughdestiny i maybe do not turn them to so much good assome better and wiser people might dofor the first time in her life mrs macatdeyspoke to glenroy's daughter in a tone slightlyindicative of pique dearest macky forgive me cried edidaembracing her and do not look so grave ifyou would not have me dislike your new friendfor having caused me to offend my own old andvalued one my darling it's not in the power of glenroy'sdochter to offend me and the creature'snot living that i would put into comparison withyou for your own sake i'm only a wee vexedthat i cannot get you to believe that is to understand or or to comprehend but deed ido not know that i do it right myself no matter said edith smiling only tellme what it is you wish me to know and i willdo my best to comprehend it but now let usset out upon our ramble this lovely morningand taking her old friend's arm within hersedith and she set out most lovingly to enjoy destinytthe pure air and balmy fragrance of a delightfulbummer namingstinykast was not sure about it and so when he sawme coming he thought he would just ride up tome and ask me to direct him and then themoment he set his eyes upon me as i told youbidfove he was so struck with my likeness to anold friend that he had not seen rami the time hewas a boy that as he said he quite forgot himself now was not that very natural in the true scotch style to answer one questionwith another shave you still got yourwatch enquired edith with a smile mrsmacauley reddened o not a bit of that question is like yourselfnow deed and i wish that your heart thatwas so innocent and unsuspicious may not begtmg corrupted and like the rest of the worldjust with dwelling amongst such unclean creatures my watch deed then he was far morelike to give me a watch if i had wanted such athing than to have taken it from me i oh mydarling beware of hasty judgments they iubecome us poor ignorant sinful creatures thatwe are forgive me dearest macky but you knowit is but a minute since you introduced yourhero to me as a highwayman but did not i tell you my dear that msnothing but a foolish fancy of my own and cuei've drought much shame of ever since for if ihad not been quite stupefied with my own senselessfright i never could have seen his face andthought ill could come of it yet tis but a few days since you declaredyou would never trust to appearances agbobfafter the weu well my dear but that was quits adifferent thing and no doubt there are manyfair faces that hide foul hearts just as thereare many worthy respectable illgiured peoplemy own good mr macauley many peothought was not very pretty because of his beingpoormarked but he was very hit to my sightfor there's no face like the face that loves us you say true said edith with a sigh asshe thought how few were the pieces that nowlooked on her with love and gladnesswell then my dear is not that one good reasonsoft my being so well pleased with this youngg destinygentleman that i was telling you about not acity but he says he is so fond of my fisice for itputs him so much in mind of an old friend's and meed he looked at me with such sweetearnest eyes i could not but believe him and so you gave him your last guineasaid edith with a smile o my dear but it grieves me to think youshould be grown so uncharitable in your wordswhen i'm sure it is not in your nature deed icould almost find in my heart not to tell youany more ah pray let me hear the conclusion of yourtale or romance or whatever it may be dearmacky i am only sorry that so much goodnessshould so often meet such bad returns but you need not vex yourself about thatthis time my dear for there's nothing of thekind that will be likely to happen as you shallhear weu says i if s very surprising thatit seems to me as if i had known you too somewherebut i cannot for the life of me say whereperhaps says he in sophie former state of existsonce and therefore let us look upon this as thedestiny renewal of old friendship which is a much betterthing than the beginning of a new one don'tyou think so deed and i do says i though i am not altogether sure about a formerstate as we have no authority for it butmaybe i have seen you at glenroy castle fori used to see so many grand and genteel peoplethere that i cannot remember either the fecesor the names of onehalf of them but justthen he stopped to sort the bridle of his horseand did not attend to what i was saying sosafter he had put it to rights he said i begyour pardon to whom does glenroy castlebelong so i told him how it had belongedto your family for generations and how it hadpleased providence to put it past your goodpapa's family and then my heart was full and so i told him more maybe than i shouldhave done and so we went on cracking togethertill we came to the door of my cottage then i was going to wish him a good nightywhen he looked about him and said what asweet little dwelling you have got here how iwish i could find just such another in this neigh destinyboyhood for i want lodgings in the countryso i told him it was not my own but belongedto a very decent couple who let part of it forlodgings and that i knew they had two roomsat the t'other end of it to let well just as iwas tweaking out came mrs smith herself andt the short and the long of it is that he tookh lodgings for three months and is to enterupon them tomorrow now what do you thinkof that my dear is that like a oliver thinkyou this went so far beyond edith's worst anticipationsthat she actually turned pale with fearas she thought of the evil consequences thatmight ensue to her poor old friend from havingg thus involved as she had no doubt withstate artful swindler and she exclaimed howcould mrs smith be so imprudent as to take anutter stranger into her house o deed mrs smith's but a narrowmindedsuspicious body for she hummed and hawedand spoke about references and securities buti said she need not mind that for i would beanswerable for himdestiny o macky this is really too much criededith shocked at the imprudence of her goodd guardianwell my dear but you should waittihyou hear me out so then mrs smith siddthat was sufficient so then says i if ryanplease i would take the liberty to ask yobfname my own name is macauley now in myseventieth year well at that his face wovercast and he hung his head for a minute ortwo with a very mournful look and i saw hiscolour come and go and deed i was beginningto feel not quite so satisfied when he lifted uphis head and looked at me with his full dearblue eyes but when i saw his fine open face iwondered at myself for my misgiving and thenhe said i am called weucome weu theni thought very naturally that he meant malcolmfor you know the english have such a way rfclipping every thing away to nothing so icoidd not but cry out what a wonderful thing thatwas for that surely he must be some relation ofthe family though he did not know it but hesighed and said the names were different destinyand then what i thought was very wellbredhe said he would be very glad to change theone name for the other and was that like arobber think you edith saw it was in vain to attempt to openthe eyes of mrs macauley's understanding as tothe dangerous predicament she had brought herselfinto by introducing a person of so suspiciousa character to the family with whom she lodgedand making herself responsible for his conductthis was the very climax of her quixotism edith now felt the want of some friend andcounsellor to whom she could apply for advice for dauntless as is the heart of woman on greatand heroic occasions still in the coarser occurrencesof this workingday world she is ill qualifiedby nature or education for taking a part for truly has it been said women are hopelesslyand incurably unfitted for businessedith experienced this as she vainly triedto devise some means for extricating her oldfriend from this dilemma but she could do nothingherself and there was no one to whomshe could apply she would not expose her todestiny the ribleys for they were quite incapable ofappreciating the excellence of her characterand comprehending the simplicity and purityof her motives and actions and she shrunk fromthe thoughts of subjecting either herself or herpoor macky to the cold inquisitorial scrutiny ofmrs ribley or the senseless loquacious tattleof her husband the only scheme that presenteditself was to try to persuade mrs macaoley to write to her nephew the wise johnnieacquainting him with what had passed and requestingof him to endeavour to find out whatdescription of person it was she had now involvedherself with should that fail she couldonly wait with patience the result of this strangesuspicious adventure destiny i chapter xvaccordingly the following monubg edithstet forth as usual for the cottage and found ihiever active macky chanting away

aportion of that book whose words were as bidto them both she began to suggest her schemewith as much delicacy and finesse as possible destiny but she had not proceeded far before she wasinterruptedi beg your pardon my dear for interruptingyou which i know is not good breeding but i see very well how it is you are vexingyourself with the thought that maybe i will beput in prison for having been caution for thatyoung man mr melcombe am i not right mot quite so bad as that dear macky saidedith your friends would never allow thatto come to pass i am surewell whatever it is you may make yourselfeasy for i can tell you he has paid the priceof his lodgings in advance for three months beforehe entered upon them for he said he couldnot expect them to take the word of a strangerand neither would he take advantage of mygenerous confidence in him or something likethat now i do not think that is very like arobber oh my dear should not this be alesson to us to beware of forming such rash andhasty judgments of one another edith smiled to hear mrs macauley's applicationof the terms rash and hasty but she was destinyin part relieved to find she was free from theresponsibility she had so thoughtlessly incurredstill she had some vague misgivings as to diecharacter of the person with whom she hadformed this sudden and somewhat suspicious intimaey with all mrs macauley's excellenciesshe certainly was not a person to captivate ayoung man at first sight neither could a strangerwho was ignorant of the qualities of herheart be supposed to enter into the peculiaritiesof her manners and the simplicity of her conversationeven allowing that her resemblanceto an dd friend had first attracted his notice yetthat resemblance must soon have disappeared ona more intimate recognition for it was scarcelypossible there could be two mrs macaulay inthe world yet why after all should i be souncharitable in my suspicions she thought this poor stranger whom i am so harshly condemningmay like myself be almost alone inthe world and his heart may have yearned asmy own would have done towards even thefancied resemblance of one known and belovedin happier days while thoughts like thesedestiny were passing through her mind mrs macanleywas doing she best she could to aid the morektourable change that was taking place inedith's sentiments o if you were to see him my dear fmsure you would almost think shame of yourselffor ever having event him to any thing thatwas bad but maybe you'll not see him at au for he says he wishes to live very retired thoughhe has some friends in the neighbourhood itold him that i thought it would be very dull forhim to live here without he had some other companythan me for that deed my best days werefled and i was not so merry as i had been no more am i says he with a sigh sowe shall suit very well in that respect andwhen i am here i do not desire any better companythan your own again edith's suspicions returned anddoes he assign no reason for the love of retirementbeyond that of enjoying the pleasure ofyour company not yet but i dare say he will tell me allabout himself by and by consider my dearb dfistinylldw very short a time it is since we have beenacquainted i do dear macky and therefore i cannotbut wonder that your friendship should havemade such rapid progress in so short a time there's no accounting for these things mydear replied her friend gravely and weought to be very thankful when a blessing comesin our way and not be too curious in examininginto it and taking it to pieces to see whafs intt just like the children with their toys oh ifwe had but the spirit of truth and thankfulnesshow many a pearl we might find in our dailypaths that now in our pride and unbelief wetrample under our feet but with regard to thisyoung gentleman his health is maybe one reasonthat he wishes to be quiet for when i sawhim in daylight yesterday he looked very paleand he told me that he was but just recoveringfrom an illness so he would need somebody totake care of him for he looks like one that couldnot take care of himselfwell dear macky i shall rejoice if youhave found a real acquisition in your new friend destiny fione who will cheer you in the many lopjlyhours you must pass while i am engaged withmy aunt speaking of that my dear i really thinkitwould maybe just as well to say nothing aboutthis to mr and mrs ribley for a little whilejijist till i know all about mr melcombe whli have no doubt will be very soon for thoughthey are very good people and very discreet tojoe yet i think they are not just so so so credulous as you are dear macky sindedith laughing as she embraced her in taklogleave well i shall keep your secret for ypuin the mean time but don't tax my forbearancetoo longseveral days passed and still no new disclosurewas made though mrs macauley's infatuationfor her new friend seemed daily to increasein spite of the reserve he maintainedi don't know how it is said she with aperplexed air one day in answer to edith'srenewed remonstrances for he is any thingbut reserved quite the contrary for he tellsme seat deal that i never knew before wd destinyhe takes pleasure too in hearing me tell him allthat i know which to be sure is not much butwhenever i speak to him of his family the cloudcomes over his open brow and he changes thesubject so i'm thinking they may be no greatthings any of them and it would be very illdone in me to distress him by seeking to pryinto his private affairsedith again felt how vain was reason or argumentwhen opposed to prejudice or partialityand wisely forbore to press the matter farthershe resolved however to watch over the interestsof her old friend as zealously as she couldand upon no account to suffer herself to be ledinto an acquaintance with one whom she couldnot yet consider as any thing but a mere adventurershe had little doubt but that mrs macauleyin the simplicity of her heart had acquaintedhim with her suspicions and either fromdelicacy or conscious deception he seemed tobe equally bent upon keeping his distance althoughhis apartments had a separate entranceat the other end of the cottage yet the windowof his sittingroom opened upon the gardendestiny and from the smallness of the cottage and itsboundaries edith was convinced he must oftenbe near them it therefore required no commoncare in one of its inmates to preserve suchstrict seclusion mrs macauley indeed representedhim as much occupied in study of somekind or another and that the only relaxationshe allowed himself were a ride on horsebackand a friendly chat with her but with all thesefriendly chats however there came not that confidentialcommunication which his friend dailylooked for but still she kept a stout heart evenagainst hope deferred destinychapter xvledith went to visit lady waldegrave's child and though she looked upon him with interestit was interest free from all emotion proof sufficienthad any been

italian nurse and german footman all ofwhom seemed sedulous to please and amuse thelittle idol committed to their charge the riblesswere too fond of seeing sights not to availthemselves of this opportunity of seeing all thatwas to be seen and edith ever willing togratify others even at the expense of her ownfeelings accepted the offer of viewing the houseand grounds and thus allowed herself to be associatedwith them in all the little mean pryingways in which vulgar people delight to go abouta great house there was much to admire the house of the purest style of italian architecturestood

looked calmlythough sadly ilion it as upon the ice of onewho had injured lier but with whom she wasnow at peace the servant pointed to a doorwhich conducted he said to lady waldegrave'sprivate

itbthink nothing of what he had seen in oorapvison of what he had not seen and he lingered behindand even peeped through the keyhole inhopes of spying something to make a wonder oibut in vain she could make nothing of it andhe was fain to return home exclaiming ever andanon well to be sure what can be in theseapartments should just like to know canguess can you kitty my dear for somedays imbr

apologies as j know you too wellto doubt your readiness to oblige you musttrow that mamma has taken it into her headthat she requires change of air which indeed isvery probable as the weather is now so very hoti wish her of all things to go to the seaside orat any rate to some distance from town i haveeven offered her waldegrave abbey for thesummer as we shall not go there till very latein the season but she persists in wishing to takepossession of woodlands which would be themost inconvenient thing in the world for me asit is all in confusion at present with my foreignheavy and i cannot have it put to rights till i amonthe spot myself and to get any thing doneas it ought to be done while mamma is in thehouse you must be aware would be quite imposesable besides there is not accommodation for jidestiny both now what i wish you to do dear edithis to take the trouble to find a furnished housewhich you think would be suitable for her asnear to where you are as possible she is reallyfond of you and as she is of course in the bestsociety it would also be an advantage to youto be with her now i do hope you will beable to gratify me in this and the sooner youcan accomplish it the better you would seeby the papers how illustrious and renowned sirreginald has become upon the turf adieu my dear believe me ever your affectionatef waldegeave mamma does not require a large house youknow only don't let it be vicar and citishthis commission it maybe supposed was notof a nature for edith to undertake and she wrotelady waldegrave briefly and coldly decliningto execute the ungracious officein a few days however she received a billetfrom lady elizabeth apprising her of her arri bestirhai in the neigukmirliood in a very indifferentslate of health and requesting te see her

i resolved to try the ejbtect of changeof air and proposed to go to woodlands for afew weeks besides liking the place itself iwas sure it would amuse me to superintend thearrangements making there the

pictures and marbles and china andcabinets and tables and vases each and any ofwhich would have been a study for a day butivhich were yet too various and numerous to beduly appreciated on a first survey tradespeoplewere still employed in some of the roomsarranging the varied treasures of art whichwere designed to form one exquisite and entireprotection all this you may suppose has not been donedestiny for nothing said lady waldegrave as theyended the hurried and imperfect examinationend she threw herself on a couch in her and indeed i am abnost frightenedwhen i think how much it has cost then wewere so cheated at first and bought such rubbishat such enormous prices but that is thecase with every body at first one must payfor a knowledge of the arts as well as for knowledgeof every kind and at any rate it is surelybetter that money should be spent upon finepictures and marbles than on the turf or at thegamingtable edith was hurt at this indirectattack upon her husband and thought how differentmust be the perception even of taste inthe material from what it was in the moral worldwhen a wife could thus seek to excuse her ownextravagance by proclaiming her husband'serrors

source of abasementto myself and friends besides having givenemployment to poor people in short it is atiling calculated in my opinion to do goodbut in the meantime i am persecuted to deathfor money by the man who undertook the thing although he must know that of course he will bepaid yet he is for ever boring me with his bills but he only asks his own said edith poor people cannot work without litreshow are they to support themselves and theirfamilies o there ate a thousand ways of ineftkutng mcstiktv that and there is nobody so poor that cannotget credit somewhere but how ruinous for the poor to contractdebt if even they could as to that it can be no worse for the poorthan for the rich it is bad for both said edith but thepoor are most to be pitied when their sufferingsare occasioned by the thoughtlessness and extravaganceof the great o certainly it is very wrong in people notto pay their bills when they can do it can do it exclaimed edith why shouldpeople ever have bills that they cannot paysurely that is robbery of the worst description why there are many things that people inacertain station must have and if they happennot to have the money just at the moment topay them where is the harm of having a bill nones if they are sure of having the moneyto discharge them otherwise it is contractingdebt well there is no harm in that i hopeelse you will think me very wicked for to tell sestiktthe truth i am over head and ears m ddbtand at this moment do not know where to geteven a few guineas this was said witherected levity and edith could only utter anexclamation of surprise and consternationthe fact is continued her ladyship speakingwith great rapidity i have been veryunfortunate first of all my fortune was netwhat it was said to be by several thousandsayear then when i married here she heaveda sigh i was quite ignorant of the value ofmoney and of course spent a great deal linenssir reginald has never chosen to give himselfany trouble in the management of our establishmentand i can't do it so we have had horridpeople who cheated us on all hands and youmay imagine how that was with three establishmentsto keep up waldegrave abbey mytown residence both of

anenormous settlement upon mamma quite out ofdestiny all pf portion to my income you will scarcelybelieve that she actually draws very near threethousand ayear from me it is much more ido assure you

hercircumstances yes she is always complaining said ladywaldegrave carelessly but i assure you it ithe case with her jointure from the glenroyestate and what i allow her besides she hasabove three thousand ayear a monstrous sumfor her she certainly must either be savingmoney or she is pillaged by the people abouther in a scandalous manner i ventured to hintthat to her some time ago but she was quiteangry so i have never entered on the subjectagain but if the thing was placed before herin a proper light and i know no one who coulddo it so well as yourself edith love i am sureshe would see the propriety of giving up at leastone thousand ayear stinteculh was unable to articulate a word sonnteh was she struck by this extraordinary lady waldegrave took no noticeof her silence but went on i

make very little difference afew hundreds ayear more or less is really notworth breaking up one's establishment but if you were to begin it is more thanprobable sir reginald would follow your example but it is not with me the retrenchmentought to begin whether or not you might at least maketrial of itand in other words make myself wretchedand uncomfortable and give up my own innocentgratifications that he may have more moneyto squander in all sorts of horrid ways besidesi am certain i only spend what i have a righttodestiny and what does sir reginald say enquirededith fearfully o as to sir reginald replied ladywaldegrave contemptuously he is the lastperson i should think of consulting the manwho spends his life between rochford's andnewmarket you may guess is no very wisecounselled and is not likely to extricate mefrom my difficulties but what is the matter are you ill oh florinda how shocked i am at all youtell me exclaimed edith bursting into tears how dreadful to be living in

happiness and the happiness of othersfor such toys as these really edith you talk in a most extraordinarymanner said lady waldegrave ingreat displeasure any one who heard youwould suppose i had committed every crimeunder the sun instead of which the sole amountk destinyof my wickedness consists simply in being ratherin want of a little money that's all and as forsir reginald he must know how i am teasedfor money for we have several limes beenthreatened with an execution in the house bysome of those horrid people oh florinda forgive me if i have spokentoo severely said edith in deep

would have been very applicablethe sums he has lost at play are enormous iknow that from the best authority and also thatat the last newmarket meeting he threw awayupwards of thirty thousand pounds

you'll make our apologies to her ladyshipsaid mr mdow and i shall write my viewsmore at large to sir reginald it was unfortunatethat he should happen to have been engagedas the fact is mrs mdow and i had madeup our minds to spend the day here but i've nodoubt he'll think better on the subject when hegives it a fair considerationedith felt relieved when she saw the partydrive off in a very gay carriage hired for theoccasion destinychapter xxiithe day was now advanced and edith elpetted that when lady elizabeth should emergefrom her apartment it would be to take herdeparture but instead of that she received amessage requesting her to wait upon her ladyshipin her dressingroom thither she repairedand found her in her usual little frivolousbustle i sent for you my dear to say that as idon't feel quite well this morning i think i shallremain where i am and i have just been writing a note to monsieur lamotte to desire him tocome hither i must say it was very cross in florindato prevent my bringing him and my poordear loves of dogs it makes me wretched to thinkhow they must be pining in myabsence but ireally think the air of this place suits me betterdestiny dthan that of the cottage to tell you the truthsi never liked a cottage his always unbecomingand it was a mere matter of convenience mygoing there at all but with my poor pittancewhat could i do however i am now resolvedto come to an understanding with my daughteras i think it quite shameful that i should bestarving on a miserable two thousand ayearwhile she is living en princesse i have seen agood deal but i have never seen any thing tosurpass the style of living here and the extravaganceof the whole establishment my maid tellsme is excessive did you ever see such a housesuch a table such dress such equipage allperfect to be sure but the very perfection ofextravagance i fear lady waldegrave will indeed bringherself into great difficulties said edith unless something can be done something must be done said lady elizabethsharply it is absolutely impossible ican live in this country upon the wretched sumallowed me as it is i have been obliged tocontract debt which i must look to her for destinycharging and then let there be a proper allowancesettled upon me i mention all this toyou my dear because i think you are the personto manage matters between florinda andme i have too much delicacy to enter on thesubject myself either with my daughter or herhusbandedith almost sickened at this new developmentof folly and misconduct she saw the evilswere r beyond her reach and that all herattempts to stem the torrent which was advancingwould be in vainyou must excuse me lady elizabethshe said mildly from undertaking the officeof adjusting your difference with lady landgrave if i could render you any service i wouldmost willingly do it but i have reason to believelady waldegrave is not in a condition tobetter your circumstances at present the fact is child you know nothing at allabout it said her ladyship angrily and imust find some one else who does so i shallremain here for some days at least during thattime i shall endeavour to come to some arrangedestinyment with my daughter in the meantime imust send the carriage for my physician andshe rang the bell to give her ordersthe thoughts of a prolonged stay in such ahouse and under such circumstances was mostpainful and embarrassing to edith and onlyone way appeared from which she could extricateherself from it lady arabella conwayhad repeatedly invited her to spend some timewith her and she had promised that if she couldleave lady elizabeth before the ribleys returnshe would do so at any time the performanceof this promise would have been a pleasure toher but doubly so on the present occasion shetherefore immediately made known her intentionsto lady elizabeth who seeing she was notlikely to be of use to her at present gave herassent to the proposallady waldegrave heard of her mother's extendedvisit and edith's proposed departurewith surprise and displeasure if mamma reallyhas a cold and will keep quietly in her room itwill be all very well said she but in a fewdays when those tiresome tradespeople will have destinymade an end of their work i expect my wholecorps dramatists and if her ladyship attemptsto join it here she gave a groan and ashrug and then it is so cruel in you edith todesert me at such a time when you might beuseful to me in a thousand ways in the firstplace i am quite certain you could if youwould take the trouble get mamma to assumein my present difficulties indeed if shedoes not i do not know what i shall do i amso pestered for moneyand you are going to have a houseful ofcompany certainly i must have company and imust have amusement i am already dying ofennui and yet you have every thing the worldcan bestow rank wealth youth beauty the husband of your choice a lovely boy ahflorinda since you find all these insufficientfor your happiness will you not seek it in stillhigher better things oh for heaven's sake don't begin to preach destiny or if you will pray reserve your sermon for sirreginald who requires it much more than i doin truth edith you know nothing of the world d i assure you you greatly overrate my advantagesin the first place my rank is next tonothing and but for other accompaniments icertainly should never have attained the consequencein society which i have done then as tomy fortune that is not half sufficient to enableme to keep pace with the people i live amongas for the husband of my choice you saw thehumour he came home in last night no bytheby you did not see it as it was all reservedfor me but i shall not enter upon that subjectat present what i wish to say is that beforeyou leave me i do wish you would sound mammaa little on money matters if she would assistme with a thousand pounds or two it would iassure you be a relief to me at present edithnow ventured to hint to her the real state of thecase with regard to lady elizabeth's finances but lady waldegrave heard it with an increduloussmile all that only tends to confirm me in my destinybelief that she is actually hoarding money saidslur and indeed it is scarcely possible it canbe otherwise for although she is for ever buyingtrumpery of some sort yet the things skebnysfare such trumpery that tis impossible she cmspend her fortune in that way so four from hoarding money lady fiabeth assures me she is actually in want of itsaid edith pshaw that must be absolute nonsensesaid lady waldegrave impatiently howeveri see you don't know mamma so you areno hand to deal with her since you take homgospel all she says i must get my steward tospeak to her though these sort of people are allso stupid and tiresome i hate to have any thingto do with them i hope you will prove a betteractress than you are an agent for i see you arereally not au fait in that department if youare resolved to go today do pray return soonas i wish to begin the rehearsals and aproposdo secure that handsome mr melcnbe for mei shall invite him as soon as the house is readypray tell him all this and but here thedestiny but here the entrance of visitors interruptedher ladyship before edith could reply theparty consisted of some fashionable and ofcourse favourite young men from town andwere hailed with delight by lady waldegravewho was again all animation and seeming happinessthe ladies bingley made their appearanceand for the first time showed signs ofanimationin a little while lady arabella conway wasannounced she had received edith's note asshe was stepping into her carriage and hadimmediately driven to woodlands as she saidto carry off her prize edith was too sincere toattempt to return in kind the expressions ofregret lady waldegrave then thought properto utter at losing her and she almost recoiledfrom the tender embrace that was bestowedupon her at parting it was not tiu she foundherself within the precincts of oakley housethat her spirits revived and she felt that shebreathed a purer better atmospherevol iii m destinychapter xxivadmiral conway and mr melcombe werewalking before the house and a groom was inattendance with a led horse so you have left all the gaieties of woodlandsto come and rusticate with us said theadmiral as he welcomed edith with all a sailor'scordiality after that i forbid any man womancmd or animal to quit my dominionswhile miss malcolm remains we must all makecommon cause to show our sense of the complimentshe has paid us parker to thegroom mr welcomes horse may be turned out tograss for he won't require it for six weeks atleast there is no disputing such commands saidmr melcombe with a smile so addressingthe servant i shall not want my horse today no nor tomorrow neither said the addestinymoral then turning to edith here have ibeen urging this gentleman to remain a weekor two with us quietly here to no purpose butno sooner does a fair lady appear than he knocksunder at once you see your influence so makea good use of it it will be all the stronger forbeing exercised as my arabella knows said hepatting his lady on the shoulder with an air ofgoodhumoured raillery my influence must be so very small saidedith that i suspect it can only serve as asort of caf spaw for your own power what an invidious insinuation exclaimedthe admiral i appeal to you melcbe ifsuch is the case not on the present occasion said mr melcombe and he coloured as he said it as thoughhe meant more than he expressed that is spoken like an honest man saidthe admiral but indeed let women say asthey will we are upon the whole much moreopen and avowed in all our proceedings thanthey are don't you agree with me melcombe destinymr melcombe was silent for a few momentsas if struggling with his emotion then in anagitated voice replied not in my own case then as if he had said too much he turnedabruptly round and walked awaya pause ensued which lady arabella was thefirst to break much as i admire both mrmelcombe's character and manners said she i confess there is a mystery about him thatto say the least of it is not pleasantthere is no mystery about his charactersaid the admiral that is well known and i'llventure to say a braver and a better man doesnot exist there are only two things i wishrespecting him the one is that he belonged tothe british navy the other that i had a sparedaughter to bestow upon him there is something so open so noble imay say in his countenance and air that seemsquite inconsistent with concealment and yethe sedulously shuns all allusion not oily to hisfamily but even to his birthplace or connexionsof any kind said lady arabellain short you have just the besetting sin ofdestiny your sex bell not satisfied with all you haveheard from good authority of this young man'scharacter and conduct you must have the historyof his parents his mother's maiden name ofcourse with a certificate of his birth and baptismwhat the plague does it signify in whatparish such a man was born i have never been able to discover even towhat country he belongs continued lady arabella his name is english but his accent andpronunciation though good are not perfectlyenglish in short miss malcolm said shesmiling take an old woman's advice and don'tfall in love with him till you know more abouthim i shall certainly follow your advice repliededith in the same tone and if i were a bonnie lass said the admiral and such a noble fellow came to courtme i should at once give him my hand and sayif i could not singo yes i will follow i will sal the world overnor think of my home when i look at my lover q destinylady arabella and edith laughed at the admiral'sromantic ardour in his friend's cause but i can tell you whats said the admiral you need not trouble your heads aboutmr melcombe's heart for on my rallyinghim on that point today he acknowledged tomethat his affections were engaged to onewhom he had loved from childhood there'sconstancy for you edith felt a little piqued at the admiral'ssupposing the state of mr melcombe's affectionscould be of any consequence to her andafter a little more chat they separated to dressfor dinner the dinner party was increasedby the arrival of some chance visitors butmr melcombe contrived to place himself besideedith at table and in spite of all her resolutionsher reserve gave way and she foundherself insensibly talking to him of mrs macauleyglenroy and inchorgan as she wouldhave done to an old friend in reply to a questionof edith's he acknowledged having been inthe highlands when a boy but he evinced somuch emotion at the interrogation that she wasdestiny sorry she had put it and immediately changedthe conversationcertainly some painful mystery attaches tothis young man she thought i wish i knewwhat it is for he seems very amiable and attimes looks very melancholys isstimtchapter xxvthere is no surer mark of a selfish characterthan that of shrinking from the truth even inits gentlest mildest form it comes an abhorredapparition to those who sunk in their own silkendreams would keep their eyes closed against allthe convictions of unpleasing reality so it waswith those whom edith had tenderly sought toawaken to the knowledge of the simplest andmost obvious of even worldly truths each dislikedeven the little she had done although theywere too much disunited to agree even on thatpoint or indeed to be aware of what had passedon either side edith was however no suffererby the disgrace into which she had fidlen as shewas allowed to remain for some days in uninterruptedtranquillity and seldom did days passaway more pleasantly each brought its roundof religious duties of benevolent actions oftranquil pleasures and rations enjoymentswhen there was no company mr melcombecommonly read for an hour or two in themorning and he possessed all the requisites forthat most rare of all accomplishments having afine voice a correct ear quick perceptions goodtaste and perfect simplicity a discussion oneday arose as to the choice of a book from amongthose which lay scattered on the library tablelady arabella proposed the life of howard thephilanthropist the admiral wished to hear thememoirs of pepys for said he the onewill send us all to prison the other will take mto court and the admiralty there we shall surestly find ourselves in better company what sayyovlf miss malcolm i am rather inclined to go to prison withhoward than to court with pepys repliededith let us try both and see whether the philanthropistor the courtier has the best of it saidmr melcombe and he read a few passages fromeach

whobut must feel the contrast which they exhibitbetween the love of duty and the love of self between the pure and exalted aspirations ofchristian piety and benevolence and the grovellingsentiments of mere worldly interest why surely no one will pretend to saythese varieties of human nature are fair specimensof any two distinct classes in the worldsaid the admiral who loved a little argumentfor its own sake at least if there be occ distantsignally a howard who in all the emergenciesof life can raise his mind to the first great causesurely we have few or no pepys in these days ofmental cultivation that there are few howards may be grantedsaid melcombe but pepys's character ifear is neither an antiquated nor an overchargedpicture his dialect may be out of fashion as hisdresses would now be but his sentiments arethose felt by all vain and vulgar minds to thisday and it must be the very truth and universalityof their application which gives his diaryits chief interestay to be sure said the admiral i hadforgot the breed of modern dandies male andfemale whose sabbathday thoughts were theyput in black and white like poor pepys's wouldnot be wherewithal shall i come before thelord but how shall i most becomingly trickout and adorn my body so as to excite the admirationand envy of my fellow creatures himself so much the source of his delighthis maker has no beauty in his sightas your favourite cowper saysdestiny and the mind of cowper awfully and mysteriouslyas it was occasionally eclipsed stillshone with a divine light which has awakenedand exalted the hearts of thousands of his fellowcreatures said melcombe but said the admiral if we could makea free choice and form our own characters couldwe hesitate think you in preferring the mind ofa howard to that of a pepys that is entirely a supposititious questionreplied melcombe since we know that of themany millions of spirits called into this state ofexistence there are none whose natural biasis not to evil but he who gave to howardthe power of becoming a ministering spirit toall who required his sympathy and aid andenlightened his mind with that divine lovewhich communicates itself to all around hetoo placed pepys in this visible world and surroundedhim with like means of improvement yet how strange and sad to read the transcript ofhis heart in his diary filled as it is with disgustingfrivolity and unfeeling levity his ideas ofgod are scarcely worthy of a savage of moral bestirtoaaty he seems to have formed no eoneejtiithe sufferings of others he appears to harneired with perfect indifference and even wkh pleadssure if he were likely to gain any advantage bythem surely had his one talent sadi as itwas been well applied he would have handeddown to posterity a very different account of hstewardship from that which now stains his memory i hope you don't mean to say it is requisitewe should all be howards said the admiralsomewhat testilyby no means replied melcombe at leastnot to the same extent or in the same way buti think each may be and many doubtless arehowards in their own sphere of action were itotherwise some of our noblest faculties wouldhave been given in vain and must lie useless andunemployedbut how do you account for pepys's constantflow of cheerfulness and contentment demandedthe admiral to all appearance he was ahappier man than howard i cannot dignify pepys's inane selfish nplfteency with the name of happiness repliedmelcombe at lest it must have been mereljtthe hairiness of an animal or an idiot whilehoward's must have been that of an angel orsuperior being his tranquillity rested on prindoles which time would only confirm and enlargewhile the enjoyment of the other dependedon mean trivial circumstances whidb could yieldno rational satisfaction and which consequentlymust have been as perishable in its nature as itwas worthless in its resultsbelieve me my good friend said the admirals your standard is too high were allhearts laid as open as poor pepys's we shouldfind thousands and tens of thousands of respectablewellbehaved people every whit as badmany much worse and all believing themselveson the high road to heaventhat may be said melcombe for thescale of humanity rises by innumerable stepsfrom the lowest to the highest state but surelythe more our moral and intellectual powers areenlarged and improved in this stage of our existencethe higher will be our destiny hereafter se destinyfor we can scarcely doubt that time and eternityare but different periods of the same staterequiring the same dispositions and cities and if so who would not have lived and died ahoward rather than a pepys i like the notion of our retaining our identity'said lady arabella and to think thatthat manycoloured web called experience whichwe weave here mingled with so many bittertears is to serve some purpose hereafter i havealways loved those verses of gambols's wherethis idea is finely expanded and she rose tookdown the and readthe mystery of
