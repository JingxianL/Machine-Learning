malian cove and cordage scarthat he might have described them among thewonders of the world onrne ignotum pro magnificois a maxim which will not in all cases holdgood there are things which we do not undervaluebecause we are familiar with them butwhich are admired the more the more thoroughlythey are known and understood it is thus withthe grand objects of nature and the finest worksof art with whatsoever is truly great and excel lent daniel was not deficient in imagination but no description of places which he had neverseen however exaggerated as such things alwaysare impressed him so strongly as these objectsin his own neighbourhood which he had knownfrom childhood three or four times in his lifeit had happened that strangers with a curiosityas uncommon in that age as it is general in thiscame from afar to visit these wonders of the westriding and daniel accompanied them with adelight such as he never experienced on anyother occasionbut the author in whom he delighted mostwas plutarch of whose works he was luckyenough to possess the worthier half if the otherhad perished plutarch would not have been apopular writer but he would have held a higherplace in the estimation of the judicious danielcould have posed a candidate for universityhonors and perhaps the examiner too with someof the odd learning which he had stored up inhis memory from these great repositories of ancientknowledge refusing all reward for suchservices the strangers to whom he officiated as aguide though they perceived that he was an extraordinaryperson were little aware how muchinformation he had acquired and of how strangea kind his talk with them did not go beyondthe subjects which the scenes they came to visitnaturally suggested and they wondered more atthe questions he asked than at any thing whichhe advanced himself for his disposition wasnaturally shy and that which had been bashfulnessin youth assumed the appearance of reserveas he advanced in life for having none to communicatewith upon his favorite studies he livedin an intellectual world of his own a mental solitudeas complete as that of alexander selkirk orrobinson crusoe even to the curate his conversationif he had touched upon his bookswould have been heathen greek and to speakthe truth plainly without knowing a letter ofthat language he knew more about the greeksthan ninetenths of the clergy at that time includingall the dissenters rind than ninetenthsof the schoolmasters alsoour good daniel had none of that confidencewhich so usually and so unpleasantly characterizesselftaught men in fact he was by nomeans aware of the extent of his acquirementsall that he knew in this kind having been acquiredfor amusement not for use he hadnever attempted to teach himself any thingthese books had lain in his way in boyhood orfallen in it afterwards and the perusal of themintently as it was followed was always accountedby him to be nothing more than recreationnone of his daily business had ever been neglectedfor it he cultivated his fields and his gardenrepaired his walls looked to the stabletended his cows and salved his sheep as diligentlyand as contentedly as if he had possessedneither capacity nor inclination for any higheremployments yet daniel was one of those menwho if disposition and aptitude were not overruledby circumstances would have grown palewith study instead of being bronzed and hardenedby sun and wind and rain there werein him undeveloped talents which might haveraised him to distinction as an antiquary a virtuosoof the royal society a poet or a theologianto which ever course the bias in his ball offortune had inclined but he had not a particleof envy in his composition he thought indeedthat if he had had grammar learning in hisyouthlike the curate he would have made more use ofit but there was nothing either of the sournessor bitterness call it which you please of repiningin this natural reflectionnever indeed was any man more contentedwith doing his duty in that state of life to whichit had pleased god to call him and well hemight be so for no man ever passed through theworld with less to disquiet or to sour him bredup in

we live in itsrealities if at any time there had been somealloy in his happiness it was when there appearedreason to suppose that in him his family wouldbe extinct for though no man knows what parentalfeelings are till he has experienced themand daniel therefore knew not the whole value ofthat which he had never enjoyed the desire ofprogeny is natural to the heart of man and thoughdaniel had neither large estates nor an illustriousname to transmit it was an unwelcomethought that the little portion of the earth whichhad belonged to his fathers time out of mindshould pass into the

latinized his name is a person whoseworks according to ballet's severe censure wereburied in the dust of a few petty colleges andunfrequented shops more than a century agohe was however in his day a person of no meanstation in the world of letters having been rectorof the university of paris at the commencementof the th century and few indeed are thewriters whose books have been so much used for perhaps no other author ever contribute solargely to the manufacture of exercises whetherin prose or verse and of sermons also textormay be considered as the first compiler of thegradus ad parnassus and that collection ofapothegms was originally formed by him whichcomrade demosthenes enlarged and rearranged which the jesuits adopted after expurgating it and which during many generations served asone of the standard commonplace books for commonplacedivines in this country as well as onthe continentbut though textor was continually working inclassical literature with a patience and perseverancewhich nothing but the delight he experiencedin such occupations could have sustainedhe was without a particle of classical taste histaste was that of the age wherein he flourishedand these his dialogues are moralities in latinverse the designs and thoughts which wouldhave accorded with their language had they beenwritten either in old french or old english appearwhen presented in

style is to be found in pierceploughman the most polished in caldron themost popular in john bunyan's holy war andabove all in his pilgrim's progress it appearsfrom the dialogues that they were not composedfor the use of youth alone as a school book butwere represented at college and poor as they arein point of composition the oddity of their combinationsand the wholesome honesty of theirsatire were well adapted to strike young imaginationsand make an impression there which betterand wiser works might have failed to leavea schoolmaster who had been regularly bredwould have regarded such a book with scorn anddiscerning at once its obvious faults would havebeen incapable of perceiving any thing whichmight compensate for them but guy was noteducated well enough to despise a writer like oldtextor what he knew himself he had pickedup where and how he could in bye ways andcorners the book was neither in any respectabove his comprehension nor below his taste and joseph wanton never

account of textor's dialogues says acritical reader might have done very well forthe retrospective review or one of the magazinesor disraeli's curiosities of literature butno one would have looked for it here where it iscompletely out of placemy good sir there is quite enough left untouchedin textor to form a very amusing paperfor the journal which you have mentioned andthe editor may thank you for

little which has beensaid of comical old textor for it is little comparedto what his dialogues contain strictlyrelates to the main thread of this most orderlyand well compacted work you will rememberthat i am now replying to the question proposedin the third chapter p i who was the doctor and as he who should undertake to edit theworks of chaucer or spenser or shakespearwould not be qualified for the task unless he hadmade himself conversant with the writings ofthose earlier authors from whose storehouses asfar as they drew from books their minds werefed so it behoved me as far

know thatchildren inevitably lacerate themselves in learningthis dreadful occupation that they are frequentlycrippled by it frequently lose theirlives in it by suffocation or by slow fire that

at the age of seventeen oreighteen to seek their living how they can insome other employment for it is only by childrenthat this can be carried on did his lordshipknow that girls as well as boys are

many quarters where it was believed toexist and so fearful a want of manliness whereit ought to have been found entitles him to therespect and gratitude of every true briton but iwill tell his

daniel could make nothingof this book and the younger who wasabout ten years old when he began to read itless than he could of the pilgrim's progressbut he made out somethingyoung daniel was free from all the isms inlily and from rhotacism to boot he was cleartoo of schism and all the worse isms which havearisen from it having by the blessing of providencebeen bred up not in any denominationending in astor indian or arian or arian but as adutiful and contented son of the church of englandin humour however he was by nature apantagruelist and indeed in his mature yearshe always declared that one of the reasons whichhad led him to reject the old humoral pathologywas that it did not include pantagruelism whichhe insisted depended neither upon heat or coldmoisture or dryness nor upon any combinationof those qualities but was itself a peculiar andelementary humour a truth he said of whichhe was feelingly and experimentally convincedand lauded the gods thereforemr wordsworth in that

withmr wordsworth that poets would be foundthere as thick as darnel in the corn and gravecounsellors would not be wanting whose advicewould be that they should be weeded outthe pantagruelists are scarcer greece producedthree great tragic poets and only onearistophanes the french had but one rabelaiswhen the seven pleiades shone in theirpoetical hemisphere we have seen a successionof great tragedians from betterton to the presenttime and in all that time there has been but onegrimaldi in whom the pantagruelism of pantomimehas found its perfect representativeand yet the reader must not hastily concludei that i think pantagruelism a better thing thanpoetry because it is rarer that were imputingto me the common error of estimating things bytheir rarity rather than their worth an errormore vulgar than any which sir thomas brownhas refuted but i do hold this that all thegreatest poets have had a spice of pantagruelismin their composition which i verily believe wasessential to their greatness what the world lostin losing the marries of homer we know notwe only know that homer had there proved himselfa pantagruelist shakespear was a pants so was cervantes and till the

imitation of gargantua had done to thesonthis book was the exposition of irenaeusphilalethes upon sir george ripley's hereticsworks daniel had formerly set as littlevalue upon it as upon rabelais he knew indeedwhat its purport was thus much he hadgathered from it but although it professed to contain the plainest and most excellent discoveriesof the most hidden secrets of the ancient philosophersthat were ever yet published it was tohim as unintelligible as the mysteries of pantshe could make nothing of the workthat was to ascend in bus and ubi from themoon up to the sun though

dictionaryfather there was one philosopherthat was pounded in a mortark that daniel said the father could neitherhave been the philosopher's fault nor his choicebut it was because he was a philosophermy lad said guy that he bore it so bravelyand said beat on you can only bruise the shellof anaxarchus if he had not been a philosopherthey might have pounded him just thesame but they would never have put him in thedictionary epictetus in like manner bore thetorments which his wicked master inflicted uponhim without a groan only saying take care oryou will break my leg and when the leg wasbroken he looked the wretch in the face and saidi told you you would break it but said the youngster there was onephilosopher who chose to live in a tub andanother who that he might never again see anythingto withdraw his mind from meditation putout his eyes by looking upon a bright brass basinsuch as i cured my warts inhe might have been a wise man said williamdove but not wondrous wise for if he had hewould not have used the basin to put his eyesout he would have jumped into a quicksethedge and scratched them out like the man of ourtown because when he saw his eyes were outhe might then have jumped into another hedgeand scratched them in again the man of ourtown was the greatest philosopher of the twoand there was one continued the boy whohad better have blinded himself at once for hedid nothing else but cry at every thing he sawwas not this being very foolish i am sure says william it was not beingmerry and wisethere was another who said that hunger washis daily foodhe must

forehead and looking mildly but seriously atthe boy addressed him thusmy son many things appear strange or sillyin themselves if they are presented to us simplywithout any notice when and where they weredone and upon what occasion if any strangersfor example had seen thee washing thy hands inan empty basin without knowing the philosophyof the matter they would have taken thee for aninnocent and thy master and me for little better or they might have supposed some conjuring wasgoing on the things which the old philosopherssaid and did would appear i dare say aswise to us as they did to the people of their owntimes if we knew why and in what circumstancesthey were done and saiddaniel there are two sorts of men in all ranksand ways of life the wise and the foolish andthere are a great many degrees between themthat some foolish people have called themselvesphilosophers and some wicked ones and somewho were out of their wits is just as certain asthat persons of all these descriptions are to befound among all conditions of menphilosophy daniel is of two kinds thatwhich relates to conduct and that which relatesto knowledge the first teaches us to value allthings at their real worth to be contented withlittle modest in prosperity patient in troubleequalminded at all times it teaches us ourduty to our neighbour and ourselves it is thatwisdom of which king solomon speaks in ourrhymebook reach me the thenturning to the passage in his favourite du bartashe read these lines she's god's own mirror j she's a light whose glancesprings from the lightening of his countenanceshe's mildest heaven's most sacred influence never decays her beauties excellenceaye like herself and she doth always tracenot only the same path but the same pacewithout her honor health and wealth would provethree poisons to me wisdom from aboveis the only moderate spring and guideorgan and honor of all gifts besidebut let us look in the bible aye this is theplacefor in her is an understanding spirit holyone only manifold subtil lively clear undefiledplain not subject to hurt loving the thing thatis good quick which cannot be letted ready todogood kind to man steadfast sure free from carehaving all power overseeing all things andgoing through all understanding pure and mostsubtil spiritsfor wisdom is more moving than any motion she passeth and goeth through all things byreason of her purenessfor she is the breath of the power of godand a pure influence flowing from the glory ofthe almighty therefore can no defiled thing fallinto herfor she is the brightness of the everlastinglight the unspotted mirror of the power of godand the image of his goodnessand being but one she can do all things andremaining in herself she maketh all things new and in all ages entering into holy souls shemaketh them friends of god and prophetsfor god loveth none but him that dwellethwith wisdomfor she is more beautiful than the sun andabove all the order of stars being comparedwith the light she is found before itfor after this cometh night but vice shallnot prevail against wisdomhe read this with a solemnity that gave weightto every word then closing the book after ashort pause he proceeded in a lower tonethe philosophers of whom you have read inthe dictionary possessed this wisdom only inpart because they were heathens and thereforecould see no farther than the light of mere reasonsufficed to shew the way the fear of the lordis the beginning of wisdom and they had notthat to begin with so the thoughts which oughtto have made them humble produced pride andso far their wisdom proved but folly the humblestchristian who learns his duty and performsit as well as he can is wiser than they he doesnothing to be seen of men and that was theirmotive for most of their actionsnow for the philosophy which relates toknowledge knowledge is a brave thing i am aplain ignorant untaught man and know myignorance but it is a brave thing when we lookaround us in this wonderful world to understandsomething of what we see to know somethingof the earth on which we move the air which webreathe and the elements whereof we are made to comprehend the motions of the moon andstars and measure the distances between themand compute times and seasons to observe thelaws which sustain the universe by keeping allthings in their courses to search into the mysteriesof nature and discover the hidden virtueof plants and stones and read the signs andtokens which are shown us and make out themeaning of hidden things and apply all this tothe benefit of our fellow creatureswisdom and knowledge daniel make thedifference between man and man and that betweenman and beast is hardly greaterthese things do not always go togetherthere may be wisdom without knowledge andthere may be knowledge without wisdom aman without knowledge if he walk humbly withhis god and live in charity with his neighboursmay be wise unto salvation a man withoutwisdom may not find his knowledge avail himquite so well but it is he who possesses boththat is the true philosopher the more heknows the more he is desirous of knowing andyet the farther he advances in knowledge thebetter he understands how little he can attainand the more deeply he feels that god alone cansatisfy the infinite desires of an immortal soulto understand this is the height and perfectionof philosophythen opening the bible which lay before himhe read these verses from the proverbsmy son if thou wilt receive my wordsso that thou incline thine ear unto wisdomand apply thine heart to understanding yea if thou cries after knowledge and liftedup thy voice for understanding if thou meekest after her as silver and searchestfor her as for hid treasures then shalt thou understand the fear of thelord and find the knowledge of godfor the lord giveth wisdom out of hismouth cometh knowledge and understandinghe layeth up sound wisdom for the righteoushe is a buckler to them that walk uprightlyhe keeper the paths of judgement andpreserved the way of his saintsthen shalt thou understand righteousnessand judgement and equity yea every good pathwhen wisdom entered into thine heart andknowledge is pleasant unto thy soul discretion shall preserve thee understandingshall keep theeto deliver thee from the way of the evildaniel my son after a pause he pursuedthou art a diligent good lad god hath giventhee a tender and a dutiful heart keep it so andit will be a wise one for thou hast the beginningof wisdom i wish thee to pursue knowledgebecause in pursuing it happiness will be found bythe way if i have said any thing now which isabove thy years it will come to mind in aftertimewhen i am gone perhaps but when thoumayest profit by it god bless thee my child he stretched out his right hand at

the autos sacramentalwhich form the most characteristic departmentof the spanish drama were prohibitedat madrid in at the instance of the contede tea then archbishop of toledo chieflybecause of the profaneness of the actors and theindecency of the places in which they were represented it seems therefore that if they had beenperformed by clerks and within consecrated predirectshe would not have

him eight years first as a pupil latterly inthe capacity of an assistant and afterwards as anadopted successorhow this connection between daniel and peterhopkins was brought about and the circumstanceswhich prepared the way for it wouldhave appeared in some of the nonexistent fourteenvolumes if it had pleased fate that theyshould have been writtensome of my readers and especially those whopride themselves upon their knowledge of theworld or their success in it will think it strangeperhaps that the elder daniel when he resolvedto make a scholar of his son did not determineupon breeding him either to the church or thelaw in either of which professions the way waseasier and more inviting now though this willnot appear strange to those other readers whohave perceived that the father had no knowledgeof the world and could have none it is neverthelessproper to enter into some explanationupon that pointif george herbert's temple or his remainsor his life by old izaak walton had all orany of them happened to be among those fewbut precious books which daniel prized so highlyand used so well it is likely that the wish of hisheart would have been to train up his son for apriest to the temple but so it was that noneof his reading was of a kind to give his thoughtsthat direction and he had not conceived anyexalted opinion of the clergy from the specimenswhich had fallen in his way a contempt whichwas but too general had been brought upon theorder by the ignorance or the poverty of a greatproportion of its members the person whoserved the humble church which daniel dutifullyattended was almost as poor as a capuchins andquite as ignorant this poor man had obtainedin evil hour from some easy or careless bishop alicence to preach it was reprehensible enoughto have ordained one who was destitute of everyqualification that the office requires the faultwas still greater in promoting him from the deskto the pulpita very great scholar is quoted by drechard as saying that such preaching as isusual is a hindrance of salvation rather than themeans to it this was said when the fashionof conceited preaching which is satirized in freygerundio had extended to england and thoughthat fashion has so long been obsolete that manypersons will be surprized to hear it had everexisted among us it may still reasonably be questionedwhether sermons such as they commonlyare do not quench more devotion than theykindlemy lord put not the book aside in displeasure i address myself to whatever bishop maybereading it unblessed i will not call myselffor i am a true and orthodox churchmanand have the interests of the church zealously atheart because i believe and know them to beessentially and inseparably connected with thoseof the commonwealth but i have been anattentive observer and as such request a hearingreceive my remarks as coming from one whoseprinciples are in entire accord with your lordship'swhose wishes have the same scope andpurport and who while he offers his honestopinion submits it with proper humility to yourjudgementthe founders of the english church did notintend that the sermon should invariably form apart of the sunday services it became so incondescension to the puritans of whom it haslong been the fashion to speak with respect insteadof holding them up to the contempt andinfamy and abhorrence which they have so richlymerited they have been extolled by their descendantsand successors as models of patriotismand piety and the success with which this delusionhas been practised is one of the most remarkableexamples of what may be effected bydint of effrontery and persevering falsehoodthat sentence i am certain will not be disapprovedat fulham or lambeth dr southeyor dr phillpots might have written itthe general standard of the clergy has undoubtedlybeen very much raised since the dayswhen they were not allowed to preach without alicence for that purpose from the ordinarynevertheless it is certain that many persons whoare in other and more material respects well oreven excellently qualified for the ministerial functionsmay be wanting in the qualifications for apreacher a man may possess great learningsound principles and good sense and yet bewithout the talent of arranging and expressinghis thoughts well in a written discourse he maywant the power of fixing the attention or reachingthe hearts of his hearers and in that case thediscourse as some old writer has said in seriousjest which was designed for edification turns toedification the evil was less in addison's dayswhen he who distrusted his own abilities availedhimself of the compositions of some approveddivine and was not disparaged in the opinion ofhis congregation by taking a printed intothe pulpit this is no longer practised but insteadof this which secured wholesome instructionto the people sermons are manufactured forsale and sold in manuscript or printed in acursive type imitating manuscript the articleswhich are prepared for such a market are for themost part copied from obscure books with moreor less alteration of language and generally forthe worse and so far as they are drawn fromsuch sources they are not likely to contain anythingexceptionable on the score of doctrine butthe best authors will not be resorted to for fearof discovery and therefore when these are usedthe congregation lose as much in point of instructionas he who uses them ought to lose inselfesteembut it is more ins curious when a more scrupulousman composes his own discourses if he bedeficient either in judgement or learning he isthen more likely to entangle plain texts than tounravel knotty ones rash positions are sometimesadvanced by such preachers unsound argumentsare adduced by them in support ofmomentous doctrines and though these thingsneither offend the ignorant and careless nor injurethe wellminded and wellinformed they carrypoison with them when they enter a diseased earit cannot be doubted that such sermons act ascorroborative for infidelitynor when they contain nothing that is actuallyerroneous but are merely improving are theyin that case altogether harmless they are notharmless if they are felt to be tedious they arenot harmless if they terrify the understanding a chill that begins there may extend to the vitalregions bishop taylor the great jeremy saysof devotional books that they

goodhas delivered an opinion upon this subject inhis admirable apology for authorized and setforms of liturgy indeed he says if i mayfreely declare my opinion i think it were notamiss if the liberty

hath not lost his painsthis sort of patience was all that daniel couldhave derived from the discourses of the poorcurate and it was a lesson of which his meekand benign temper stood in no need naturehad endowed him with this virtue and thissunday's discipline exercised without strengtheningit while he was in the phrase of the religiouspublic sitting under the preacher heobeyed to a certain

listen and which when themind is at ease and the body in health is theforerunner and usher of sleep he certainly gaveway the curate's voice past over his ear likethe sound of the brook with which it blended andit conveyed to him as little meaning and less feeling during the sermon therefore he retiredinto himself with as much or as little edificationas a quaker finds at a silent meetingit happened also that of the few clergy withinthe very narrow circle in which daniel movedsome were in no good repute for their conductand none displayed either that zeal in the dischargeof their pastoral functions or that earnestnessand ability in performing the service ofthe church which are necessary for commandingthe respect and securing the affections of theparishioners the clerical profession had neverpresented itself to him in its best which is really its true light and for that cause he would neverhave thought of it for the boy even if the meansof putting him forward in this path had beeneasier and more obvious than they were andfor the dissenting ministry daniel liked not thename of a nonconformist the puritans hadleft behind them an ill savour in his part of thecountry as they had done every where else andthe extravagances of the primitive quakerswhich during his childhood were fresh in remembrancehad not yet been forgottenit was well remembered in those parts that thevicar of kirkby lonsdale through the malignityof some of his puritanical parishioners had beentaken out of his bed from his wife who was thenbig with child and hurried away to lancasterjail where he was imprisoned three years for noother offence than that of fidelity to his churchand his king and that the man who was achief instigator of this persecution and had enrichedhimself by the spoil of his neighbour'sgoods though he flourished for a while boughta field and built a fine house came to poverty atlast and died in prison having for some timereceived his daily food there from the table of oneof this very vicar's sons it was well rememberedalso that in a parish of the adjoining countypalatinethe puritanical party had set fire in thenight to the rector's barns stable and parsonageand that he and his wife and children had onlyas it were by miracle escaped from the flameswilliam dove had also among his traditionalstores some stories of a stranger kind concerningthe quakers these parts of the north havingbeen a great scene of their vagaries in their earlydays he used to relate how one of them wentinto the church at brough during the reign ofthe puritans with a white sheet about his bodyand a rope about his neck to prophesy beforethe people and their whig priest as he calledhim that the surplice which was then prohibitedshould again come into use and that the gallowsshould have its due and how when their ringleadergeorge fox was put in prison at carlislethe wife of justice benson would eat no meatunless she partook it with him at the bars of hisdungeon declaring she was moved to do thiswherefore it was supposed he had bewitched herand not without reason for when this old georgewent as he often did into the church to disturbthe people and they thrust him out and fellupon him and beat him sparing neither sticksnor stones if they came to hand he was presentlyfor all that they had done to him as sound andas fresh as if nothing had touched him andwhen they tried to kill him they could not takeaway his life i and how this old george rode agreat black horse upon which he was seen in thecourse of the same hour at two places threescoremiles distant from each other and how someof the women who followed this old george usedto strip off all their clothes and in that plight gointo the church at service time on the sunday tobear testimony against the

miller's history of doncasterand in that print the dwelling in questionis included it had undergone no other alterationat the time this view was taken than that ofhaving had its casements replaced by sash windowsan improvement which had been made byour doctor when the frame work of the casementshad become incapable of repair the giltpestle and mortar also had been removed from itsplace above the door internally the change hadbeen greater for the same business not beingcontinued there after the doctor's decease theshop had been converted into a sitting room andthe very odour of medicine had passed awaybut i will not allow myself to dwell upon thismelancholy subject the world is full of mutationsand there is hardly any that does not bringwith it some regret at the time and alas morein the retrospect i have lived to see the americancolonies separated from great britain thekingdom of poland extinguished the republic ofvenice destroyed its territory seized by oneusurper delivered over in exchange to anotherand the transfer sanctioned and confirmed by allthe powers of europe in congress assembled i have seen heaven knows how many little principalitiesand states proud of their

allvanish themselves wherefore then should i lament over what timeand mutability have done to a private dwellinghousein doncaster it was an old house which when it was builthad been one of the best in doncaster and evenafter the great improvements which have changedthe appearance of the town had an air of antiquatedrespectability about it had it been nearthe church it would have been taken for theharringtonvicarage standing where it did its physiognomywas such that you might have guessed it was thedoctor's house even if the pestle and mortar hadnot been there as his insignia there were eightwindows and two doors in front it consisted oftwo stories and was oddly built the middle parthaving something in the scotch manner the formof a gable end towards the street behind thiswas a single chimney tall and shaped like a jpillar in windy nights the doctor was so oftenconsulted by mrs dove concerning the stabilityof that chimney that he accounted it the plagueof his life but it was one of those evils whichcould not be removed without bringing on a worsethe alternative being whether there should be atoll chimney or a smoky house and after themansion house was erected there was one windwhich in spite of the chimney's elevation drovethe smoke down so inconvenient is it sometimesto be fixed near a great neighbourthis unfortunate chimney being in the middleof the house served for four apartments thedoctor's study and his bedchamber on the upperfloor the kitchen and the best parlour on thelower that parlour yes reader that very parlourwherein as thou canst not have

relate about the clock some forty or fiftyyears ago a butcher being one of the churchwardensof the year and fancying himself in thatcapacity invested with full power to alter and improveany thing in or about the church thoughtproper to change the position of the clock andaccordingly had it removed to the highest part ofphilemonthe tower immediately under the battlementsmuch beautiful gothic work was cut away tomake room for the three dials which he placedon three sides of this fine tower and when hewas asked what had induced him thus doubly todisfigure the edifice by misplacing the dials anddestroying so much of the ornamental part thegreat and greasy pillow answered that by fixingthe dials so high he could now stand at his ownshop door and see what it was o'clock thatconvenience this arrant churchwarden had thesatisfaction of enjoying for several years therebeing no authority that could call him to accountfor the insolent mischief he had done butarchdeacon markham to his praise be it spokenat the end of the last century prevailed on thethen churchwardens to remove two of the dialsand restore the architectural ornaments whichhad been defacedthis was the clock which with few intervalsmeasured out by hours the life of daniel dovefrom the seventeenth year of his age when hefirst set up his rest within its soundperhaps of all the works of man sundials andchurchclocks are those which have conveyedmost feeling to the human heart the clock morethan the sundial because it speaks to the ear aswell as to the eye and by night as well as by dayour forefathers understood this

purpose as much as the mementowhich is so commonly seen upon an old clockfaceand so seldom upon a new one i neverhear chimes that they do not remind me of thosewhich were formerly the first sounds i

about twentytimes every body went out doubting whetherthere was an earthquake or whether the deanwas dead or the college on fire however nothingwas the matter but that tom was taken illin his bowels

friendswould have had its place with those who havedeserved well of their kind and reflected honorupon their countrybut i return to a subject which would haveinterested him in his antiquarian pursuits forhe loved to wander among the ruins of timewe will return therefore to that ceremony ofchristening church bells which with other practicesof the holy roman catholic and apostolicchurch has been revived in francebells say those theologians in issimi whohave gravely written upon this grave matterbells say they are not actually baptized withthat baptism which is administered for the remissionof sins but they are said to be christenedbecause the same ceremonies which are observedin christening children are also observed in consecratingthem such as the washing the anointingand the imposing a name all which howevermay more strictly be said to represent the signsand symbols of baptism than they may be calledbaptism itselfnothing can be more candid bells are notbaptized for the remission of sins because the originalsin of a bell would be a flaw in the metalor a defect in the tone neither of which the priestundertakes to remove there was however a previousceremony of blessing the furnace when thebells were cast within the precincts of a monasteryas they most frequently were in former times andthis may have been intended for the prevention ofsuch defects the brethren stood round the furnaceranged in processional order sang the thpsalm and then after certain prayers blessed themolten metal and called upon the lord to infuseinto it his grace and overshadow it with his powerfor the honor of the saint to whom the bell wasto be dedicated and whose name it was to bearwhen the time of christening came the officiatingpriest and his assistant named every bellfive times as a sort of prelude for some unexplainedreason which may perhaps be as significantand mystical as the other parts of the ceremonyhe then blessed the water in two vesselswhich were prepared for the service dipping aclean linen cloth in one of these vessels he washedthe bell within and without the bell being suspendedover a vessel wider in circumference thanthe bell's mouth in order that no drop of thewater employed in this washing might fall to theground for the water was holy certain psalmswere said or sung they were the th and thefour last in the psalter during this part of theceremony and while the officiating priest preparedthe water in the second vessel this hedid by sprinkling salt in it and putting holy oilupon it either with his thumb or with a stick if the thumb were used it was to be cleanedimmediately by rubbing it well with salt over thesame water then he dipt another clean clothoin this oiled and salted water and again washedthe bell within and without after the servicethe cloths were burnt lest they should be profanedby other uses the bell was then authenticallynamed then it was anointed with chrismin the form of a cross four times on the broadestpart of the outside thrice on the smaller partand four times on the inside those parts beinganointed with most care against which the clapperwas to strike after this the name was againgiven myrrh and frankincense were thenbrought the bell was incensed while part of apsalm was recited and the bell was authenticallynamed a third time after which the priest carefullywiped the chrism from the bell with towand the tow was immediately burnt in the censernext the priest struck each bell thrice with itsclapper and named it again at every stroke every one of the assistants in like manner struckit and named it once the bells were then carefullycovered each with a cloth and immediatelyhoisted that they might not be contaminated byany irreverent touch the priest concluded byexplaining to the congregation if he thoughtproper the reason for this ceremony of christeningthe bells which was that they might act aspreservatives against thunder and lightning andhail and wind and storms of every kind andmoreover that they might drive away evil spiritsto these and their other virtues the bishop ofchains alluded in his late truly gallican androman catholic discourse the bells said heplaced like sentinels on the towers watch overus and turn away from us the temptations of theenemy of our salvation as well as storms andtempests they speak and pray for us in ourtroubles they inform heaven of the necessitiesof the earthnow were this edifying part of the romancatholic ritual to be reintroduced in the britishdominions as it very possibly may be now thatlord peter has appeared in his robes before theking and been introduced by his title the opportunitywould no doubt be taken by the bishopor jesuit who might direct the proceedings ofcomplimenting the friends of their cause by namingthe first holy and happy family after themand to commemorate the extraordinary union ofsentiment which that cause has brought about betweenpersons not otherwise remarkable for anysimilitude of feelings or opinions they might unitetwo or more names in one bell as is frequentlydone in the human subject and thus with a peculiarfelicity of compliment shew who and whoupon this great and memorable occasion haveputted together
