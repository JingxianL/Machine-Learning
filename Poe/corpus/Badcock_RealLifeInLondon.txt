triumphant returning at night with the spoil
like bacchanals shouting and gay
how sweet with a bottle and song to refresh
and lose the fatigues the day
with sport wit and wine fickle fortune defy
dull wisdom all happiness sours
since life is no more than a passage at best
let's strew the way over with flowers
they order these things better in london replied the hon tom
dashall to an old weatherbeaten sportsman who would fain have made a
convert our london sprig fashion to the sports and delights 
rural life the party were regaling themselves after the dangers and
fatigues a very hard day's foxchace and while the sparkling glass
circulated each anxious to impress on the minds the company the
value the exploits and amusements in which he felt most delight
became more animated and boisterous in his oratory forgetting that
excellent regulation which forms an article in some the rules and
orders our free and easier in london that no more than three
gentlemen shall be allowed to speak at the same time the whole party
consisting fourteen like a pack in full cry had with the kind
assistance the rosy god become at the same moment most animated
not to say vociferous orators the young squire bob tally ho as he
was called belville hall who had recently come into possession 
this fine and extensive domain was far from feeling indifferent to the
pleasures a sporting life and in the chace had even acquired the
reputation being a keen sportsman but the regular intercourse
which took place between him and his cousin the hon tom dashall 
bond street notoriety had in some measure led to an indecision
 character and often when perusing the lively and fascinating
descriptions which the latter drew the passing scenes in the
gay metropolis bob would break out into an involuntary exclamation
 curse me but after all this only is real life while for the
moment horses dogs and gun with the whole paraphernalia 
sporting were annihilated indeed to do justice to his elegant
and highlyfinished friend these pictures were the production a
masterhand and might have made a dangerous impression on minds
more stoical and determined than that bob's the opera theatres
fashionable pursuits characters objects c all became in succession
the subjects his pen and if lively description blended with
irresistible humour and sarcastic wit possessed any power seduction
these certainly belonged to bob's honourable friend and relative as an
epistolary correspondent the following stanzas were often recited by
him with great feeling and animation
parent pleasure and many a groan
i should be loath to part with thee i own
dear life
to tell the truth i'd rather lose a wife 
should heav'n e'er deem me worthy possessing
that best that most invaluable blessing
i thank thee that thou brightest me into being
the things this our world are well worth seeing
and let me add moreover well worth feeling
then what the devil would people have
these gloomy hunters the grave
for ever sighing groaning canting kneeling
some wish they never had been born how odd
to see the handy works god
in sun and moon and starry sky
though last not least to see sweet woman's charms
nay more to clasp them in our arms
and pour the soul in love's delicious sigh
is well worth coming for i'm sure
supposing that thou gav'st us nothing more
yet thus surrounded life dear life i'm thine
and could i always call thee mine
i would not quickly bid this world farewell
but whether here or long or short my stay
i'll keep in mind for ev'ry day
an old french motto vive la bagatelle 
misfortunes are this lotteryworld's sad blanks
presents in my opinion not worth thanks
the pleasures are the twenty thousand prizes
which nothing but a downright ass despises
it was not however the mere representations bob's friend with
which in consequence the important result we commenced our
chapter that produced the powerful effect fixing the wavering mind
 bob no it was the air the manner the je ne sais quoi by which
these representations were accompanied the curled lip contempt and
the eye measuring as he spoke from top to toe his companions with
the cool elegant sang froid and selfpossession displayed in his own
person and manner which became a fiat with bob and which effected
the object so long courted by his cousin
after the manner yorick though by the bye no sentimentalist bob
thus reasoned with himself if an acquaintance with london is to give
a man these airs superiority this ascendancy elegance manners
and command enjoyments why london for me and if pleasure is the
game in view there will i instantly pursue the sport
the song and toast in unison with the sparkling glass followed each
other in rapid succession during which our elegant london visitor
favoured the company with the following effusion sung in a style equal
to though unaccompanied with the affected airs and selfimportance 
a firstrate professor
song
if to form and distinction in town you would bow
let appearance wealth be your care
if your friends see you live not a creature cares how
the question will only be where
a circus a polygon crescent or place
with ideas magnificence tally
squares are common streets queer but a lane's a disgrace
and we've no such thing as an alley
a first floor's pretty well and a parlour so so
but pray who can give themselves airs
or mix with high folks if so vulgarly low
to live up in a two pair stairs
the garret excuse me i mean attic floor
that's the name and it's right you should know it
would he tenantless often but genius will soar
and it does very well for a poet
these amusements the table were succeeded by a most stormy and
lengthened debate to use a parliamentary phrase during which bob's
london friend had with daring heroism opposed the whole the party
in supporting the superiority life in london over every pleasure
the country could afford after copious libations to bacchus whose
influence at length effected what oratory had in vain essayed and
silenced these contending and jarring elements greyeyed morn peeped
intrusively amid the jovial crew and somnus with the cart before the
horse stepping softly on tiptoe after his companion led if not by
at least accompanied with the music the nose each to his snoring
pillow
glorious resolve exclaimed tom as soon as his friend had next
morning intimated his intention nobly resolved indeed what shall
he whom nature has formed to shine in the dance and sparkle in the
ring to fascinate the fair lead and control the fashions attract the
gaze and admiration the surrounding crowd shall he pass a life or
rather a torpid existence amid country bumpkins and johnnyraws forbid
it all ye powers that rule with despotic sway where life alone is to
be found forbid it cards dice balls fashion and ye gay et
covers forbid pon my soul interrupted bob you have
frightened me to death i thought you were beginning an epic a thing
i abominate all others i had rather at any time follow the pack on
a foundered horse than read ten lines homer so my dear fellow
descend for god's sake from the heroics
calmly let me at least begin life's chapter
not panting for a hurricane rapture
calm let me step not riotous and jumping
with due decorum let my heart
try to perform a sober part
not at the ribs be ever bumping bumping
rapture's a charger often breaks his girt
runs oft and flings his rider in the dirt
however it shall be so adieu my dear little roan
filly snowball good by my new patent doublebarrelled
percussion ah i give you all up order the tandem my dear tom
whenever you please whisk me up to the fairy scenes you have so often
and admirably described and above all things take me as an humble and
docile pupil under your august auspices and tuition says tom 
the day unheeded and forgotten
the next advance our hero was an important step the mailcoach is
considered the school its driver the great master the art the
phidias the statuary the claude the landscapepainter to
approach him without preparatory instruction and study would be like
an attempt to copy the former without a knowledge anatomy or the
latter while ignorant perspective the standard excellence the
model perfection all that the highest ambition can attain is to
approach as near as possible the original to attempt a deviation would
be to bolt out the course snap the curb and run riot sensible
 the importance his character accustomed to hold the reins 
arbitrary power and seated where will is law the mailwhip carries
in his appearance all that may be expected from his elevated situation
stern and sedate in his manner and given to taciturnity he speaks
sententiously or in monosyllables if he passes on the road even an
humble follower the profession with four tidy ones in hand he
views him with ineffable contempt and would consider it an irreparable
disgrace to appear conscious the proximity should it be a country
gentleman large property and influence and he held the reins
and handled the whip with a knowledge the art so to get over the
ground coachy might perhaps notice him en passant by a slight
and familiar nod but it is only the peer or man firstrate sporting
celebrity that is honoured with any thing like a familiar mark 
approbation and acquaintance and these justly appreciating the proud
distinction feel higher gratification by it than any thing the monarch
could bestow it is an inclination the head not forward in the
manner a nod but towards the off shoulder accompanied with a
certain jerk and elevation from the opposite side but here neither pen
nor pencil can depict it belongs to him alone whose individual powers
can nightly keep the house in a roar to catch the living manner and
present it to the eye
a merrier man
within the limit becoming mirth

his eye begets occasion for his wit
for every object that the one doth catch

and now gentle reader if the epithet means any thing you cannot but
feel disposed to good humour and indulgence instead rattling you
off as was proposed at our last interview and whirling you at the
rate twelve miles an hour exhausted with fatigue and half dead
in pursuit life we have proceeded gently along the road amusing
ourselves by the way rather with drawing than driving tis high time
however we made some little progress in our journey come bob
take the reins push on keep moving touch up the leader into a
handgallop give snarler his head that's it my tight one keep out 
the ruts mind your quartering not a gig buggy tandem or tilbury
have we yet seen on the road what an infernal place for a human
being to inhabit curse me if i had not as lief emigrate to the back
settlements america one might find some novelty and amusement
there i'd have the woods cleared cut out some turnpikeroads and
like palmer start the first mail stop tom don't set off yet
to the illinois here's something ahead but what the devil it is i
cant guess why it's a barge on wheels and drove fourinhand ha
ha barge indeed bob you seem to know as much about coaches as snarler
does backgammon i suppose you never see any thing in this quarter
but the old heavy bridgewater why we have half a dozen new launches
every week and as great a variety names shape size and colour
as there are ships in the navy we have the heavy coach light coach
caterpillar and mail the balloon comet fly dart regulator
telegraph courier times highflyer hope with as many others as
would fill a list as long as my tandemwhip what you now see is one 
the new patent safetycoaches you can't have an overturn if you're
ever so disposed for a spree the old city cormorants after a gorge 
mockturtle turn into them for a journey and drop off in a nap
with as much confidence security to their neck and limbs as if they
had mounted a rockinghorse or dropt into an armchair ah come
the scene improves and becomes a little like life here's a dasher
making up to the safety why its no impossible can't be gad it
is tho the dart by all that's good and drove by hellfire
dick there's a fellow would do honour to any box drove the cambridge
fly three months pass'd every thing on the road and because he
overturned in three or four hard matches the stupid rascals 
proprietors moved him off the ground joe spini who's at corpus
christ matched dick once for when he carried five inside
and thirteen at top besides heavy luggage against the other
cambridge never was a prettier race seen at newmarket dick must
have beat hollow but a d d fat alderman who was inside and felt
alarmed at the velocity the vehicle moved to the other the
seat this destroyed the equilibrium over they went into a fourfeet
ditch and joe lost his match however he had the satisfaction 
hearing afterwards that the old cormorant who occasioned his loss had
nearly burst himself by the concussion
see see dick's got up to and wants to give the safety the go
by gad its a race go it dick now safety d d good cattle
both lay it in to em dick leaders neck and neck pretty race
by g ah its no use safety dick wont stand it a dead
beat there she goes all up over by jove i can't see for that
tree what do you say tom is the race over race ah and the coach
too knew dick would beat him would have betted the long odds the
moment i saw it was him
the tandem had by this time reached the racecourse and the disaster
which tom had hardly thought worth noticing in his lively description 
the sport sure enough had befallen the new patent safety which was
about mid way between an upright and a side position supported by the
high and very strong quicksethedge against which it hath fallen our
heroes dismounted left flip at the leader's head and with ned the
other groom proceeded to offer their services whilst engaged in
extricating the horses which had become entangled in their harness and
were kicking and plunging their attention was arrested by the screams
and outrageous vociferations a very fat middleaged woman who
had been jerked from her seat on the box to one not quite so
smooth the top the hedge which with the assistance an old alder
tree supported the coach tom found it impossible to resist the violent
impulse to risibility which the ludicrous appearance the old lady
excited and as no serious injury was sustained determined to enjoy the
fun
if e'er a pleasant mischief sprang to view
at once o'er hedge and ditch away he flew
nor left the game till he had run it down
approaching her with all the gravity countenance he was master
 madam says he are we to consider you as one the sylvan
deities who preside over these scenes or connected in any way with the
vehicle vehicle indeed you inhumanbrutes instead assisting
a poor distressed female who has been chucked from top that there
safetything as they calls it into such a dangerous position you
must be chuckling and grinning must you i only wish my husband mr
giblet was here he should soon wring your necks and pluck some 
your fine feathers for you and make you look as foolish as a peacock
without his tail mrs giblet's ire at length having subsided she was
handed down in safety on terra firma and our heroes transferred their
assistance to the other passengers the violence the concussion had
burst open the coachdoor on one side and a london dandy the
exquisite genus lay in danger being pressed to a jelly beneath the
weight an infirm and very stout old farmer whom they had pick'd upon
the road and it was impossible to get at so as to afford relief to
the sufferers till the coach was raised in a perpendicular position
the farmer was no sooner on his legs than clapping his hand with
anxious concern into an immense large pocket he discovered that a
bottle brandy it contained was crack'd and the contents beginning to
escape i ax pardon young gentleman says he seizing a hat that the
latter held with great care in his hand and applying it to catch the
liquor i ax pardon for making so free but i see the hat is a little
out order and can't be much hurt and its a pity to waste the
liquor such a price as it is nowadays sir what do you mean
shouldn't have thought your taking such liberties indeed but makes
good the old saying impudence and ignorance go together my hat
out order hey i'd have you to know sir that that there hat
was bought lloyd in newgatestreet only last thursdaysand cost
eighteen shillings and if you look at the in his window on
hats dedicated to the head you'll find that this here hat is a real
exquisite so much for what you know about hats my old fellow i burst
my stays all to pieces in saving it from being squeezed out shape
and now this old brute has made a brandybottle it oh oh my
young miss in disguise replied the farmer i thought i smelt a
rat when the captain left the coach under pretence walking up the
hill what i suppose you are bound for gretna both you lev young
lady
every thing appertaining to the coach being now righted our young
friends left the company to adjust their quarrels and pursue their
journey at discretion anxious to reach the next town as expeditiously
as possible where they purposed sleeping for the night they mounted
the tandem smack went the whip and in a few minutes the stagecoach
and its motley group had disappeared
having reached their destination and passed the night comfortably they
next morning determined to kill an hour or two in the town and were
taking a stroll arm in arm when perceiving by a playbill that an
amateur fashion from the theatres royal drury lane and haymarket
was just come in and would shortly come out 
 it would be injustice to great talents not to notice
among other important discoveries and improvements the
age the labours lloyd who has classified and arranged
whatever relates to that necessary article personal
elegance the hat he has given the world a volume on the
subject hats dedicated to their great patron the head
in which all the endless varieties shape dependent
before on mere whim and caprice are reduced to fixed
principles and designated after the great characters by
which each particular fashion was first introduced the
advantages to gentlemen residing in the country must be
incalculable they have only to refer to the engravings in
mr lloyd's work where every possible variety is clearly
defined and to order such as may suit the rank or character
in life they either possess or wish to assume the
following enumeration comprises a few the latest fashions
the wellington the regent the caroline the
bashful the dandy the shallow the exquisite the marquis
the new dash the clericus the tallyho the noble lord
the tantum the bangup the irresistible the bon ton the
paris beau the baronet the eccentric the bit blood
c
in a favourite character they immediately directed their steps
towards a barn with the hope witnessing a rehearsal chance
introduced them to the country manager and tom having asked several
questions about this candidate was assured by mr mist
oh he is a gentlemanperformer and very useful to us managers for he
not only finds his own dresses and properties but struts and frets
his hour on the stage without any emoluments his aversion to salary
recommended him to the lessee drurylane theatre though his services
had been previously rejected by the subcommittee
can it be that gamecock the gay lothario said tom who sports an
immensity diamonds
 coates's frolics he course well knew rare pastime for the
ragamuffin crew who welcome with the crowing a cock this hero 
the buskin and sock
oh no rejoined mr mist that cock don't crow now this gentleman
i assure you has been at a theatrical school he was instructed by the
person who made master betty a young roscius
tom shook his head as if he doubted the abilities this instructed
actor to be a performer he thought as arduous as to be a poet and
if poeta nascitur non fit consequently an actor must have natural
abilities
and pray what character did this gentleman enact at drurylane
theatre
hamlet prince denmark answered mr mist shakespeare is his
favourite author
and what said the critics to be or not to be i suppose he repeated
the character
oh sir it was stated in the playbill that he met with great
applause and he was announced for the character again but as the free
list was not suspended and our amateur dreaded some hostility from that
quarter he performed the character by proxy and repeated it at the
little theatre in the haymarket
then the gentlemen the free list remarked bob are free and
easy
yes yes they laugh and cough whenever they please indeed they are
generally excluded whenever a full house is expected as ready
money is an object to the poor manager drurylane theatre the
british press however is always excepted
the british press oh you mean the newspapers exclaimed tom then
i dare say they were very favourable to this amateur fashion
no not very indeed they don't join the manager in his puffs
notwithstanding his marked civility to them one said he was a methodist
preacher and sermonized the character another assimilated him to a
schoolboy saying his lesson in short they were very illnatured but
hush here he is walk in gentlemen and you shall hear him rehearse
some king richard
king richard what ambition thought bob to himself late a prince
and now a king
i assure you continued mr mist that all his readings are new but
according to my humble observation his action does not always suit the
word for when he exclaims may hell make crooked my mind he looks
up to heaven
looks up to heaven exclaimed tom then this london star makes a
solecism with his eyes
our heroes now went into the barn and took a private corner when they
remained invisible their patience was soon exhausted and bob and his
honourable cousin were both on the fidgets when the representative 
king richard exclaimed
give me a horse 
whip added tom with stunning vociferation before king richard
could bind up his wounds the amateur started and betrayed consummate
embarrassment as if the horsewhip had actually made its entrance tom
and his companion stole away and left the astounded monarch with the
words twas all a dream
while returning to the inn our heroes mutually commented on the
ambition and folly those amateurs fashion who not only sacrifice
time and property but absolutely take abundant pains to render
themselves ridiculous certainly says tom this cacoethes ludendi
has made fools several this infatuated youth though not possessed
 a single requisite for the stage no doubt flatters himself he is
a second kean and regardless his birth and family he will
continue his strolling life
till the broad shame comes staring in his face
and critics hoot the blockhead as he struts
having now reached the inn and finding every thing adjusted for their
procedure our heroes mounted their vehicle and went in full gallop for
real life in london
chapter iii
round round and roundabout they whiz they fly
with eager worrying whirling here and there
they know nor whence nor whither where nor why
in utter hurryscurry going coming
maddening the summer air with ceaseless humming
our travellers now approached at a rapid rate the desideratum
 their eager hopes and wishes to one all was novel wonderful and
fascinating to the other it was the welcome return to an old and
beloved friend the separation from whom had but increased the ardour
 attachment we now says dashall are approaching hydepark
and being sunday a scene will at once burst upon you far surpassing
in reality any thing i have been able to pourtray notwithstanding
them and though by some he
is termed a visionary an enthusiast and a tool party his adherence
to the rights the subject and his perseverance to uphold the
principles the constitution are deserving the admiration every
englishman and although his fortune is princely and has been at his
command ever since an early age he has never had his name registered
among the fashionable gamesters at the clubs in st james'sstreet
newmarket or elsewhere he labours in the vineyard utility rather
than in the more luxuriant garden folly and according to general
conception may emphatically be called an honest man but come said
tom it is time for us to move homeward the company are drawing off i
see we must shape our course towards piccadilly
they dashed through the park not however without being saluted by many
 his fashionable friends who rejoiced to see that the honourable
tom dashall was again to be numbered among the votaries real life in
london while the young squire whose visionary orbs appeared to be
in perpetual motion dazzled with the splendid equipages the moving
panorama was absorbed in reflections somewhat similar to the following
no spot on earth to me is half so fair
as hydepark corner or st james's square
and happiness has surely fix'd her seat
in palace yard pall mall or downing street
are hills and dales and valleys half so gay
as bright st james's on a levee day
what fierce ecstatic transports fire my soul
to hear the drivers swear the coaches roll
the courtier's compliment the ladies clack
the satins rustle and the whalebone crack
chapter 
together let us beat this ample field
try what the open what the covert yield
the latent tracts the giddy heights explore
 all who blindly creep or sightless soar
eye nature's walks shoot folly as it flies
and catch the manners living as they rise
it was half past five when the hon tom dashall and his enraptured
cousin reached the habitation the former who had taken care to
dispatch a groom apprizing mrs watson the housekeeper his
intention to be at home by half past six to dinner consequently all
was prepared for their reception the style elegance in which tom
appeared to move struck tallyhoho at once with delight and astonishment
as they entered the drawingroom which was superbly and tastefully
fitted up and commanded a cheerful view piccadilly welcome my
dear bob said tom to his cousin to all the delights town come
tell me what you think its first appearance only remember you
commence your studies life in london on a dull day tomorrow you
will have more enlivening prospects before you why in truth
replied bob the rapidity attraction is such as at present to leave
no distinct impressions on my mind all appears like enchantment and
i am completely bewildered in a labyrinth wonders to which there
appears to be no but under your kind guidance and tuition i may
prove myself an apt scholar in unravelling its intricacies by this
time they had approached the window
aye aye says dashall we shall not be long i see without some
object to exercise your mind upon and dispel the horrors
oh for that muse fire whose burning pen
records the godlike deeds valiant men
then might our humble yet aspiring verse
our matchless hero's matchless deeds rehearse
bob was surprised at this sudden exclamation his cousin and
from the introduction naturally expected something extraordinary though
he looked around him without discovering his object
that continued tom is a peer pointing to a gig just turning the
corner whom it may be said
to many a jovial club that peer was known
with whom his active wit unrivall'd shone
choice spirit grave freemason buck and blood
would crowd his stories and bon mots to hear
and none a disappointment e'er need fear
his humour flow'd in such a copious flood
it is lord c who was formerly well known as the celebrated major
h the companion the now most distinguished personage in the
british dominions and who not long since became possessed his
lordly honours some particulars him are worth knowing he was
early introduced into life and often kept both good and bad company
associating with men and women every description and every rank
from the highest to the lowest from st james's to st giles's in
palaces and nightcellars from the drawingroom to the dustcart he
can drink swear tell stories cudgel box and smoke with any one
having by his intercourse with society fitted himself for all companies
his education has been more practical than theoretical though he was
brought up at eton where notwithstanding he made considerable progress
in his studies he took such an aversion to greek that he never would
learn it previous to his arrival at his present title he used to be
called honest george and so unalterable is his nature that to this
hour he likes it and it fits him better than his title but he has
often been sadly put to his shifts under various circumstances he was
a courtier but was too honest for that he tried gaming but he was too
honest for that he got into prison and might have wiped off but he
was too honest for that he got into the coal trade but he found it a
black business and he was too honest for that at drawing the longbow
so much perhaps cannot be said but that you know is habit not
principle his courage is undoubted having fought three duels before he
was twenty years age
being disappointed in his hope promotion in the army he resolved in
spite the remonstrances his friends to quit the guards
and solicited an appointment in one the hessian corps at that
time raising for the british service in america where the war the
revolution was then commencing and obtained from the landgrave hesse
a captain's commission in his corps wagers
previous to his departure for america finding he had involved himself
in difficulties by a profuse expenditure too extensive for his income
and an indulgence in the pleasures the turf to a very great extent
he felt himself under the necessity mortgaging an estate about
l per annum left him by his aunt and which proved unequal to
the liquidation his debts he remained in america till the the
war where he distinguished himself for bravery and suffered much with
the yellow fever on his return he obtained an introduction to the
prince wales who by that time had launched into public life and
became one the jovial characters whom he selected for his associates
and many are the amusing anecdotes related him the prince conferred
on him the appointment equerry with a salary l a year this
however he lost on the retrenchments that were afterwards made in the
household his royal highness he continued however to be one 
his constant companions and while in his favour they were accustomed
to practice strange vagaries the major was always a wag ripe and ready
for a spree or a lark 
to him a frolic was a high delight
a frolic he would hunt for day and night
careless how prudence on the sport might frown
at one time when the favourite's finances were rather low and the
mosses ran taper it was remarked among the vivants the
party that the major had not for some time given them an invitation
this however he promised to do and fixed the day the prince
having engaged to make one upon this occasion he took lodgings in
tottenhamcourt road went to a winemerchant promised to introduce
him to the royal presence upon his engaging to find wine for the party
which was readily acceded to and a dinner three courses was served
up three such courses perhaps were never before seen when the
company were seated two large dishes appeared one was placed at the
top the table and one at the bottom all was anxious expectation
the covers being removed exhibited to view a baked shoulder 
mutton at top and baked potatoes at the bottom they all looked around
with astonishment but knowing the general eccentricity their host
they readily fell into his humour and partook his fare not doubting
but the second course would make ample amends for the first the wine
was good and the major apologized for his accommodations being as he
said a family sort man and the dinner though somewhat uncommon
was not such an one as is described by goldsmith
at the top a fried liver and bacon were seen
at the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureen
at the sides there were spinach and pudding made hot
in the middle a place where the pasty was not
at length the second course appeared when lo and behold another baked
shoulder mutton and baked potatoes surprise followed surprise but
another and another still succeeds
the third course consisted the same fare clearly proving that he
had in his catering studied quantity more than variety however they
enjoyed the joke eat as much as they pleased laughed heartily at the
dinner and after simpering till a late hour took their departure it
is said however that he introduced the winemerchant to his highness
who afterwards profited by his orders
 this remarkable dinner reminds us a laughable
caricature which made its appearance some time ago upon the
marriage a jew attorney in jewrystreet lydgate to the
daughter a wellknown fishmonger st peter'salley
cornhill when a certain baronet alderman colonel and
then lord mayor opened the ball at the london tavern as
the partner the bride a circumstance which excited
considerable curiosity and surprise at the time we know the
worthy baronet had been a hunter for a seat in parliament
but what he could be hunting among the children israelis
perhaps not so easily ascertained we however are not
speaking the character but the caricature which
represented the bride not resting on abraham's bosom but
seated on his knee surrounded by their guests at the
marriagefeast while to a panel just behind them appears
to be affixed a bill fare which runs thus
first course fish
second course fish
third course fish
perhaps the idea the artist originated in the anecdote
above recorded
it is reported that the prince gave him a commission under an
express promise that when he could not shew it he was no longer to
enjoy his royal favour this commission was afterwards lost by the
improvident possessor and going to call on the donor one morning who
espying him on his way he threw up the sash and called out well
george commission or no commission no commission by g your
highness was the reply
then you cannot enter here rejoined the prince closing the window
and the connection at the same time
his lordship now resides in the regent's park and may almost nightly
be seen at a publichouse in the neighbourhood where he takes his grog
and smokes his pipe amusing the company around him with anecdotes 
his former days we may perhaps fall in with him some night in
our travels and you will find him a very amusing and sometimes very
sensible sort fellow till he gets his grog on board when he can be
as boisterous and blustering as a coalheaver or a bully his present
fortune is impaired by his former imprudence but he still mingles with
the sporting world and a short time back had his pocket picked at a
milling match a valuable gold repeater he has favoured the world
with several literary productions among which are memoirs his own
life embellished with a view the author suspended from to use the
phrase a late celebrated auctioneer a hanging wood and a very
elaborate treatise on the art ratcatching in the advertisement 
the latter work the author engages it will enable the reader to clear
any house these noxious vermin however much infested excepting
only a certain great house in the neighbourhood st stephen's
westminster
 it appears by the newspapers that the foundation a
certain great house in pall mall is rotten and givingway
the cause is not stated but as it cannot arise from being
topheavy we may presume that the rats have been at work
there query would not an early application the major's
recipe have remedied the evil and prevented the necessity
 a removal a very heavy body which course must be
attended with a very heavy expense tis a pity an old
friend should have been overlooked on such an occasion
do you said tom pointing to a person on the other side 
the way see that young man walking with a halfsmothered air 
indifference affecting to whistle as he walks and twirling his
stick he is a onceaweek man or in other words a sunday
promenade harry hairbrain was born a good family and at the
decease his father became possessed ten thousand pounds which
he sported with more zeal than discretion so much so that having been
introduced to the gaming table by a pretended friend and fluctuated
between poverty and affluence for four years he found himself
considerably in debt and was compelled to seek refuge in an obscure
lodging somewhere in the neighbourhood tilbury in order to avoid
the traps for as he observes he has been among the greeks and
pigeons who have completely looked him and now want to crow
over him he has been at hide and seek for the last two months and
depending on the death a rich old maiden aunt who has no other heir
he eventually hopes to diddle em 
this narrative hairbrain was like hebrew ta tallyhoho who requested
his interesting cousin as he found himself at salt to try back and
put him on the right scent 
ha ha ha said tom we must find a new london vocabulary i see
before we shall be able to converse intelligibly but as you are now
solely under my tuition i will endeavour to throw a little light upon
the subject
your onceaweek man or sunday promenade is one who confines
himself to avoid confinement lodging in remote quarters in the
vicinity the metropolis within a mile or two the bridges
oxford street or hydepark corner and is constrained to waste six
uncomfortable and useless days in the week in order to secure the
enjoyment the seventh when he fearlessly ventures forth to recruit
his ideas to give a little variety to the sombre picture life
unmolested to transact his business or to call on some old friend
and keep up those relations with the world which would otherwise be
completely neglected or broken
among characters this description may frequently be recognised the
remnant fashion and perhaps the impression nobility not wholly
destroyed by adversity and seclusion the air and manners a man
who has outlived his century with an assumption sans souci
pourtrayed in his agreeable smile murmur'd through a low whistle 
begone dull care or no more by sorrow chased my heart or played
off by the flourishing a whip or the rapping a boot that hasa
spur attached to it which perhaps has not crossed a horse for
many months and occasionally by a judicious glance at another man's
carriage horses or appointments which indicates taste and the former
possession such valuable things these form a part the votaries
 real life in london this however said he observing his cousin in
mute attention is but a gloomy part the scene vet perhaps not
altogether uninteresting or unprofitable
i can assure you replied tallyhoho i am delighted with the accurate
knowledge you appear to have society in general while i regret the
situation the actors in scenes so glowingly described and am only
astonished at the appearance such persons
you must not be astonished at appearances rejoined dashall for
appearance is every thing in london and i must particularly warn you
not to found your judgment upon it there is an old adage which says
to be poor and seem poor is the devil all over why if you meet
one these sundaymen he will accost you with urbanity and affected
cheerfulness endeavouring to inspire you with an idea that he is one 
the happiest mortals while perhaps the worm sorrow is secretly
gnawing his heart and preying upon his constitution honourable
sentiment struggling with untoward circumstances is destroying
his vitals not having the courage to pollute his character by a
jaildelivery or to condescend to whitewashing or some low bankrupt
trick to extricate himself from difficulty in order to stand upright
again
a onceaweek man or sunday promenade frequently takes his way
through bye streets and short cuts through courts and alleys as it
were between retirement and a desire to see what is going on in the
scenes his former splendour to take a sly peep at that world from
which he seems to be excluded
and for all such men replied bob expelled from high and from good
society even though i were compelled to allow by their own imprudence
and folly i should always like to have a spare hundred to send
them in an anonymous cover
you are right rejoined tom catching him ardently by the hand
the sentiment does honour to your head and heart for to such men in
general is attached a heartbroken wife withering by their side in the
shade as the leaves and the blossom cling together at all seasons in
sickness or in health in affluence or in poverty until the storm beats
too roughly on them and prematurely destroys the weakest but i must
warn you not to let your liberality get the better your discretion
for there are active and artful spirits abroad and even these
necessities and miseries are made a handle for deception to entrap the
unwary and you yet have much to learn puff lived two years on sickness
and misfortune by advertisements in the newspapers
how enquired bob
you shall have it in his own words said dashall
i suppose never man went through such a series 
calamities in the same space time sir i was five
times made a bankrupt and reduced from a state 
affluence by a train unavoidable misfortunes then
sir though a very industrious tradesman i was twice
burnt out and lost my little all both times i lived
upon those fires a month i soon after was confined by a
most excruciating disorder and lost the use my limbs
that told very well for i had the case strongly attested
and went about col called on you a close prisoner
in the marshalsea for a debt benevolently contracted
to serve a friend i was afterwards twice tapped
for a dropsy which declined into a very profitable
consumption i was then reduced to no then
i became a widow with six helpless children after
having had eleven husbands pressed and being left
every time eight months gone with child and without
money to get me into an hospital
astonishing cried bob and are such things possible
a month's residence in the metropolis said dashall will satisfy
your enquiries one ingenious villain a short time back had artifice
enough to defraud the public at different periods his life 
upwards one hundred thousand pounds and actually carried on
his fraudulent schemes to the last moment his existence for he
defrauded jack ketch his fee by hanging himself in his cell
after condemnation
just as a tilbury was passing observe said tom the driver that
tilbury is the celebrated lord cripplegate with his usual equipage his
blue cloak with a scarlet lining hanging loosely over the vehicle
gives an air importance to his appearance and he is always attended
by that boy who has been denominated his cupid he is a nobleman
by birth a gentleman by courtesy and a gamester by profession he
exhausted a large estate upon odd and even sevens the main c till
having lost sight the main chance he found it necessary to curtail
his establishment and enliven his prospects by exchanging a first floor
for a second without an opportunity ascertaining whether or not
these alterations were best suited to his high notions or exalted taste
from which in a short time he was induced either by inclination or
necessity to take a small lodging in an obscure street and to sport
a gig and one horse instead a curricle and pair though in former
times he used to drive four in hand and was acknowledged to be an
excellent whip he still however possessed money enough to collect
together a large quantity halfpence which in his hours relaxation
he managed to turn to good account by the following stratagem he
distributed his halfpence on the floor his little parlour in straight
lines and ascertained how many it would require to cover it having
thus prepared himself he invited some wealthy spendthrifts with whom
he still had the power associating to sup with him and he welcomed
them to his habitation with much cordiality the glass circulated
freely and each recounted his gaming or amorous adventures till a late
hour when the effects the bottle becoming visible he proposed as a
momentary suggestion to name how many halfpence laid side by side would
carpet the floor and offered to lay a large
 charles price the wellknown impostor whose extensive
forgeries on the bank england rendered him notorious may
serve as a practical illustration puff for he at
several periods his life carried on his system fraud
by advertisements and by personating the character a
clergyman collecting subscriptions under various pretences
his whole life is marked with determined and systematic
depravity he hanged himself in tothilfields bridewell
where he was confined at the age fiftyfive
wager that he would guess the nearest done done was echoed
round the room every one made a deposit l and every one made a
guess equally certain success and his lordship declaring he had
a large lot halfpence by him though perhaps not enough the
experiment was to be tried immediately twas an excellent hit the room
was cleared to it they went the halfpence were arranged rank and file
in military order when it appeared that his lordship had certainly
guessed as well he might nearest to the number the consequence was
an immediate alteration his lordship's residence and appearance he
got one step in the world by it he gave up his secondhand gig for
one warranted new and a change in his vehicle may pretty generally be
considered as the barometer his pocket
do you mark he is hearing at that pretty girl on the other side the
way he is fond the wenches and has been a true votary fashion
perhaps there is not a more perfect model real life in london than
might be furnished from the memoirs his lordship he is rather a good
looking man as he sits and prides himself on being a striking likeness
 his present majesty but unfortunately has a lameness which
impedes him in the ardour his pursuit game although it must be
acknowledged he has been a game one in his time the boy you see with
him is reported to be his own son who is now employed by him as an
assistant in all his amorous adventures
his own son exclaimed bob
aye and if so a merrily begotten one i'll be bound for it
continued tom such things will happen and his lordship has kept a
very pretty assortment servant girls but the introduction this
youth to public notice was somewhat curious it is said that having a
large party bon vivants to dine with him on sitting down to table
and taking the cover off one the dishes a plump and smiling infant
appeared a sweet little cupid by
exclaimed his lordship i'll be his father i'll
take care him call rose and tell her to look out for a nurse for
him thus taking upon himself the character parent and protector as
well as parson young cupid was christened in libations claret and
furnished a fund amusement for the evening how young cupid came
there i believe has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained
who seeks a friend should come disposed
t exhibit in full bloom disclosed
the graces and the beauties
that form the character he seeks
for tis an union that bespeaks
reciprocated duties
and thus it has proved with cupid himself the offspring an illicit
amour is now constantly engaged in promoting others
his lordship had three brothers billingsgate delegate and
newgate whose names are adorned with a similarity perfections in
the temple fame but they are consigned to the tomb the capulet
and we will not rake up the ashes the dead
at this moment a loud knocking was heard at the door and mr sparkle
was ushered into the drawingroom which he entered as it were with a
hop step and jump and had tom dashall by the hand almost before they
could turn round to see who it was
my dear fellow exclaimed sparkle almost out breath where have
you been to time has been standing still since your departure there
has been a complete void in nature how do you do i beg pardon
turning to bob you will excuse my rapture at meeting my old friend
whom i have lost so long that i have almost lost myself egad i have
run myself out breath cursed unlucky i was not in the park this
morning to see you first but i have just heard all about you from lady
jane and lost no time in paying my respects what are you going to do
with yourself
 there was a delicate propriety in this conduct the hon
tom dashall which cannot but be admired for although they
were alone and speaking to each other in perfect
confidence it was always his desire to avoid as much as
possible making bad worse he had a heart to feel as well
as a head to think and would rather lend a hand to raise a
fellowcreature from the mud than walk deliberately over
him besides he foresaw other opportunities would arise in
which from circumstances he would almost be compelled to
draw his cousin's attention again to the persons in
question and he was always unwilling to exhast a subject
 an interesting nature without sonic leading occurrence to
warrant it
at this moment dinner was announced come said tom let us
refresh a bit and after dinner i will tell you all about it we are
travellers you know and feel a little fatigued allons allons and
so saying he led the way to the dinnerroom
nothing could be more apropos said sparkle for although i have
two engagements beforehand and have promised a visit to you know who in
the evening they appear like icicles that must melt before the sun 
your reappearance so i am your's and to it they went tom always
kept a liberal table and gave his friends a hearty welcome but here
it will be necessary while they are regaling themselves to make
our readers a little acquainted with charles sparkle esq for which
purpose we must request his patience till the next chapter
chapter v
place me thou great supreme in that blest state
unknown to those the silly world call great
where all my wants may be with ease supply'd
yet nought superfluous to pamper pride
it will be seen in the previous chapter that the formal ceremony
 a fashionable introduction such as mr sparkle my friend mr
robert tallyhohohoho belville hall mr tallyhohohoho mr charles sparkle was
altogether omitted indeed the abrupt entrance the latter rendered
it utterly impossible for although sparkle was really a wellbred man
he had heard from lady jane tom's arrival with his young friend from
the country etiquette between themselves was at all times completely
unnecessary an air gaiety and freedom as the friend dashall was
introduction enough to bob and consequently this point good breeding
was wholly unnoticed by all the party but we are not yet sufficiently
acquainted with our readers to expect a similar mode proceeding will
be overlooked we shall therefore lose no time in giving our promised
account mr sparkle and beg to introduce him accordingly
mr reader mr sparkle mr sparkle mr reader
hold sir what are you about you have bewildered yourself with
etiquette and seem to know as little about life in london as the
novice you have already introduced by the way that introduction was
one the most extraordinary i ever met with this may be equally so
for ought i know and i really begin to suspect you are an extraordinary
fellow yourself how can you introduce me whom you know nothing
egad i believe you have me there a palpable hit my lord or my
lady for i certainly cannot say which i was getting myself into an
awkward dilemma but i hate suspicion
suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind
methinks i see a frown but i meant no offence and if you throw
down my in a rage you will perhaps not only remain ignorant 
mr sparkle but what is more important those other
numerous fashionable characters in high and low life those
manners incidents amusements follies vices c which combined
together form the true picture real life in the metropolis
he who hath trod th intricate maze
exploring every devious way
can best direct th enquiring gaze
and all the varied scenes display
mr author you are a strange rambler
admitted sir or ma'am i am a rambler who with your permission
would willingly not be impeded in my progress and under such
expectations i shall proceed
charles sparkle was the son and only child a right hon member 
parliament now no more whose mother dying soon after his birth was
left destitute that maternal kindness and solicitude which frequently
has so much influence in forming the character the future man
his father a man eccentric turn mind being appointed soon
afterwards to a diplomatic situation abroad left the care his son's
education to an elderly friend his who held a situation some
importance under the then existing government with an injunction to
conceal from the boy the knowledge his real parent and to bring him
up as his own child
this important trust was executed with tenderness and fidelity the boy
grew in strength and ripened in intelligence and being accustomed
to consider his protector as his parent the father upon returning
to england determined not to undeceive him until he should arrive at
years discretion and with this view mr oxford was instructed at a
proper age to send him to oxford
charles however had contracted before this period habits and
acquaintances in london that were completely in opposition to the
dictates and inclinations his supposed father he became passionately
fond literary amusements music and drawing which served to occupy
his morning hours but his evenings were devoted to the company 
vitiated associates who did not fail to exercise their influence
over his youthful passions and he frequently engaged himself in unlucky
and improvident adventures which involved him in pecuniary difficulties
far beyond his stipulated income these circumstances were no sooner
made known to the supposed parent than they excited his displeasure
and being carried to an unpardonable extent he was at the age 
eighteen literally banished the house his protector and compelled
to take an obscure lodging in the vicinity london the rent which
was paid for him and a scanty allowance one guinea sent to him
regularly every saturday night thus secluded from his old associates
it will not be wondered at that he contrived to form new ones and
having purchased an old harpsichord turned the musical instruction
he had received to occasional account he also wrote some political
pamphlets which were well received but this solitary and dependent life
was wholly unsuited to the gaiety in which he had hitherto moved it
had however the effect drawing forth talent which perhaps would
never but for this circumstance have been discovered for
many a gem purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness on the desert air
his writings c under the name oribrd were recognised by the real
father as the productions a promising son at his instigation and
upon a promise reform he was again restored to his former home and
shortly after entered as a gentleman commoner st mary's oxford but
not till he had by some means or other made the discovery that
oxford was not his real name congenial spirits are naturally fond 
associating and it was here that he first became acquainted with the
hon tom dashall they were constant companions and mutual assistants to
each other in all their exercises as well as all their vagaries so
as to cement a friendship and interest in each other's fate up to the
moment which we are now speaking
oxford however was at that time more impetuous and less discreet
in the pursuit his pleasures than his honourable friend and after
obtaining the distinction bachelor arts was in consequence 
his imprudence and irregularities after frequently hairbreadth
escapes expelled the college this circumstance however appeared 
little consequence to him he hired a gig at oxford promising to return
in a few days and came up to london but had not effrontery enough to
venture into the presence his reputed father on arrival in town he
put up at an inn in the borough where he resided till all the money
he had was exhausted and till as he emphatically observes he had
actually eaten his horse and chaise
in the mean time the people at oxford found he was expelled and ashe
had not returned according to appointment he was pursued and
eventually found they had no doubt obtaining their demand from
his friends and he was arrested at the suit the lender which was
immediately followed by a retainer from the innkeeper where he had
resided in town application was made to mr oxford for his liberation
without effect in consequence which he became a resident in the
rules the king's bench as his friends conceived by this means his
habits would be corrected and his future conduct be amended his real
father still keeping in the back ground
while in this confinement he again resorted to the produce his pen
and his talent for musical composition and his friend tom at the first
vacation did not fail to visit him during this time in the shape
 donation from mr oxford he received occasional supplies more than
equal to his necessities though not to his wishes while here he
fished out some further clue to the real parent who visited him in
disguise during his confinement as a friend mr oxford still
however he had no chance liberation till being one day called on
by mr oxford he was informed he was at perfect liberty to leave his
present abode and was directed to go with him immediately a coach was
called and he heard the direction given to drive to bedford square
where they arrived just time enough to learn that the right hon s s
had breathed his last after a lingering illness
upon alighting from the coach and receiving this information they were
ushered into the drawingroom and presently joined by a clergyman who
had been the chaplain the deceased who acquainted our adventurer 
the death his parent that by will he was entitled to l
per annum and a handsome estate in wiltshire this sudden reverse
 fortune to sparkle the change from confinement to liberty from
indigence to affluence awakened sensations more easily to be conceived
than described he wept perhaps the first tears sincerity in his
life his heart was subdued by an overwhelming flood affection for
that unknown being whom he now found had been his constant guardian
angel alternately taking oxford and the reverend divine by the hand
and hiding his head in the bosom his reputed father at length they
led him to the room in which were the remains his lamented parent
there are perhaps few circumstances better calculated to impress awe
on the youthful mind than the contemplation those features in death
which have been respected and revered while living such respect had
ever been entertained by charles sparkle for the supposed friend 
mr oxford from whom he had several times received the most kind and
affectionate advice and his sensations upon discovering that friend
to be no other than his own father may be more easily conceived than
described he was at once exalted and humbled delighted and afflicted
he threw himself in an agony feeling by the bedside fell on his
knees in which he was joined by the clergyman and oxford where he
remained some time
after the first paroxysms grief had subsided young sparkle who had
already felt the strongest impression that could possibly be made on
a naturally good heart gave orders for the funeral his deceased
father and then proceeded to make other arrangements suitable to
the character he was hereafter to sustain through life went down
to wiltshire and took possession his estate where for a time he
secluded himself and devoted his attention to the perusal the
best authors in the english french and italian language under the
superintendence the reverend divine who had been a resident for many
years with his father
but a life in the country could not long have superior charms for a
young man who had already seen much to admire as well as much to avoid
in the metropolis the combination however theoretical information
he had derived from books as well as the practical observations he had
made during his residence in london fitted him at once for the
gayest and most distinguished circles metropolitan society
he therefore arranged with mr oxford who had formerly acted as his
parent to continue with him in the capacity steward and for the
last two years his life had been almost a constant resident at
long's hotel in bond street not choosing to have the charge an
establishment in town and the early friendship and attachment which
had been cultivated at oxford being again renewed appeared to grow with
their growth and strengthen with their strength
sparkle had still a large portion that vivacity for which he was so
remarkable in his younger days his motives and intentions were at all
times good and if he indulged himself in the pursuits frolic and
fun it was never at the expence creating an unpleasant feeling to an
honest or honourable mind his fortune was ample he had a hand to give
and a heart to forgive no malice or hatred were there to be found
but these qualifications and the exercise them sufficient traits
will be given in the ensuing pages no man was better up to the rigs
 the town no one better down to the manoeuvres the flats and
sharps he had mingled with life in all companies he was at once an
elegant and interesting companion his views were extensive upon all
subjects his conversation lively and his manners polished
such gentle reader is the brief sketch charles sparkle the
esteemed friend the hon tom dashall and with such recommendations
it will not be wondered at if he should become also the friend nd sure to do her good
so much for living in style and good breeding
that's your true breeding that's your sort my boys
fun fire and pathos metre mirth and noise
to make you die with laughter or the hiccups
tickle your favourites or smash your teacups
by the way in former times the term goodbreeding meant a
combination all that was amiable and excellent and a wellbred
person would shrink from an action or expression that could possibly
wound the feelings another its foundation was laid in truth and
its supporting pillars were justice and integrity sensibility and
philanthropy but
in this gay age in taste's enlighten'd times
when fashion sanctifies the basest crimes
e'en not to swear and game were impolite
since he who sins in style must sure be right
a wellbred person must learn to smile when he is angry and to laugh
even when he is vexed to the very soul
it would be the height mauvaise honte for a welled person to
blush upon any occasions whatever no young lady blushes after eleven
years age to study the expression the countenance others in
order to govern your own is indispensably necessary
in former times no wellbred person would have uttered a falsehood
but now such ideas are completely exploded and such conduct would now
be termed a bore my lord portly remarks it is a cold day yes my
lord it is a very cold day replies major punt in two minutes after
meeting lord lounge who observes he thinks the weather very warm yes
very warm my lord is the reply thus contradicting himself almost in
the same breath it would be perfectly inconsistent in a wellbred
man to think for fear being absent when he enters or leaves a
drawingroom he should round his shoulders drop his head and
imitate a clown or a coachman this has the effect the best ruse
de guerre for it serves to astonish the ladies when they afterwards
discover by the familiarity his address and his unrestrained
manners what a wellbred man he is for he will address every fair one
in the room in the most enchanting terms except her to whom in the same
party he had previously paid the most particular attention and on her
he will contrive to turn his back for the whole evening and if he is a
man fashion he will thus cause triumph to the other ladies and save
the neglected fair one from envious and slanderous whisperings
an admirable picture living in style and good breeding indeed
cried tom the game is in view and well worth pursuit so hark forward
hark forward my boys
sparkle now recollecting his engagement with you know who as he
significantly observed in the last chapter withdrew after promising to
take a stroll by way killing an hour or two with them in the morning
and tom and his cousin soon after retired to rest
perchance to sleep perchance to dream
chapter 
the alarm was so strong
so loud and so long
twas surely some robber or sprite
who without any doubt
was prowling about
to fill ev'ry heart with affright
the smiles a may morning bedecked with the splendid rays a
rising sun awakened tallyhoho about five o'clock and being accustomed to
rise early in the country he left the downy couch soft repose and
sought his way down stairs not a sound any kind was to be heard in
the house but the rattling the carts and the coaches in the streets
with the deeptoned accompaniment a fustian's bell and an occasional
ab libitum clothes clothes sale gave bob an idea that all the
world was moving however he could find nobody up he walked into the
drawingroom amused himself for some time by looking out the window
indulging his observations and remarks without knowing what to make 
the moving mass incongruities which met his eye and wondering what
time the servants the house would wake he tried the streetdoor but
found it locked bolted and chained and if he had known where to have
found his friend tom he would have aroused him with the view halloo 
it is strange thought he to himself all the world seems abroad
and yet not a soul stirring here then checking the current his
reflections but this said he is life in london egad i must not
make a noise because it will not be good breeding in this way he
sauntered about the house for near two hours till at last espying his
portmanteau which had been left in the passage by the servants the
previous evening i'll carry this up stairs said he by way 
amusement and carelessly shouldering the portmanteau he was walking
deliberately up stairs when his ears were suddenly attracted by a
loud cry murder murder thieves murder and the violent ringing
 a bell alarmed at these extraordinary sounds which appeared to be
near him at a moment when he conceived no soul was stirring he dropped
his portmanteau over the banisters which fell demolishing in its way
an elegant grecian patent lamp with glass shades drops c into the
passage below with a hideous crash while the cry murder thieves
murder was repeated by many voices and rendered him almost immoveable
in the next moment the butler the cook the groom and indeed every
person in the house appeared on the staircase some almost in a state
 nudity and shrinking from each other's gaze and all armed with
such weapons as chance had thrown in their way to attack the supposed
depredator
among the rest fortunately for tallyhoho who stood balancing himself
against the banisters in a state indecision whether he should ascend
or descend tom dashall in his nightgown burst out his room in alarm
at the noise with a brace pistols one in his hand in the very act
 cocking it and the other placed in convenient readiness under his
left arm why what the devil is the matter vociferated he and at
that moment his eye caught the agitated figure his cousin bob on the
halflanding place below him at the sound his wellknown voice the
innocent and unsuspecting cause this confusion and alarm looked up
at his friend as if half afraid and half ashamed the occurrence and
stammered out where is the thief who is murdered i'll swear there
is something broke somewhere tell me which way to go tom looked
around him at the group halfclad nymphs and swains who were now
huddling together conceiving their security lay in combination and
finding all eyes were placed with astonishment and wonder on bob began
to see through what had happened and burst into an immoderate fit 
laughter which relieved the frightened damsels but so confounded poor
tallyhoho that he scarcely knew whether he was standing on his head or
his heels why said tom addressing himself to his cousin you will
get yourself murdered if you go wandering about people's houses at the
dead the night in this manner are you asleep or awake who have you
made an assignation with or where are you going to what are you
up to master bobby eh these tricks won't do here
isn't love's unhallow'd flame invites to roam
and bids you from your pillow creep
or say why thus disturb my peaceful home
like macbeth who doth murder sleep
tallyhoho was unable to reply he looked down over the banister he looked
up at the risible features tom dashall who was almost bursting at
the ludicrous situation in which he found his friend and his servants
come said tom there are no thieves all's right to the
servants you may quiet your minds and go to business bob i'll be
down with you presently upon this the staircase was cleared in an
instant all but the unfortunate tallyhoho and peace appeared to
be restored in the family but not to bob's mind conceiving he had
committed a gross violation good breeding and shewn but a bad
specimen his aptitude to become a learner london manners it must
be confessed it was rather an awkward commencement however in a few
minutes recovering himself from the fright he crawled gently down the
stairs and took a survey the devastation he had made cursed the
lamp d d the portmanteau then snatching it from the ruin before
him and again placing his luggage on his shoulder he quietly walked upstairs
to his bedroom
it is much to be lamented in this wonderful age discovery and
continual improvement that our philosophers have not yet found out a
mode supplying the place glass as almost every thing else with
castiron the substitution gas for oil has long been talked as
one national importance even so much so that one man whose ideas
were as brilliant as his own experiments has endeavoured to shew that
its produce would in a short time pay off the national debt
a consummation devoutly to be wished and experience has taught the
world at large there is nothing impossible nor is there any one inexistence
more credulous than honest john bull but we are
 mr windsor the original lecturer on the powers gas in
pall mall
digressing from the adventure the lamp however it was
occasioned by clearly proving it was not a patent safetylamp and
that among the luxuries the hon tom dashall's habitation gas had
not yet been introduced will speedily be discovered
upon arriving in his bedroom wondering within himself how he should
repair the blundering mistake which he had so unluckily been the
unwilling and unconscious author he found himself in a new dilemma
as the receptacle the oil had fallen with the lamp and plentifully
bedewed the portmanteau with its contents so that he had now
transferred the savoury fluid to his coat waistcoat cravat and shirt
what was to be done in such a case he could not make his appearance in
that state but his mortifications were not yet at an 
hills over hills and alps on alps arise
the key his portmanteau was missing he rummaged all his pockets
in vain he turned them inside out it was not here it was not
there enraged at the multiplicity disappointments to which he was
subjected he cut open the leathern carriage his wardrobe with
a penknife undressed and redressed himself by which time it was
halfpast eight o'clock his cousin tom who had hurried down according
to promise had in the mean time been making enquiry after him and now
entered the room singing
and all with attention would eagerly mark
when he cheer'd up the pack hark to lockwood hark hark
at the sight dashall he recovered himself from his embarrassment
and descended with him to the breakfastparlour
did you send to robinson's enquired tom one the servants as
they entered the room yes sir was the reply and weston's too
continued he being answered in the affirmative then let us have
breakfast directly then turning to bob sparkle said he promised
to be with us about eleven for the purpose taking a stroll in the
mean time we must dress and make ready dress said bob egad
i have dressed and made ready twice already this morning he then
recounted the adventures above recorded at which dashall
repeatedly burst into fits immoderate laughter breakfast being over
a person from mr robinson's was announced and ushered into the room
a more prepossessing appearance had scarcely met bob's eye a tall
elegant young man dressed in black cut in the extreme fashion
whose features bespoke intelligence and whose air and manner were
indicative a something which to him was quite new he arose upon his
entrance and made a formal bow which was returned by the youth good
morning gentlemen good morning mr r said tom mentioning
a name celebrated by
pope in the following lines
but all my praises why should lords engross
bise honest muse and sing the man boss
i am happy to have the honour seeing you in town again sir
the fashionables are mustering very strong and the prospect the
approaching coronation appears to be very attractive during this
time he was occupied in opening a leathern case which contained combs
brushes c then taking off his coat he appeared in a jacket with an
apron which like a fashionable pinafore the present day nearly

the coronation is a subject deep importance just now in the

which genius is entitled to and talents will invariably

addressing the audience it had inscribed at the bottom

in allusion no doubt to the tragedy barbarossa
it was an extraordinary situation for all parties said bob but
hold who have we here egad there is an elegant carriage drawn up to
the door some lord or nobleman i'll be bound for it we can't be seen
in this deshabille i shall make my escape and saying this he was
hastening out the room
ha ha ha exclaimed tom you need not be so speedy in your flight
this is one the fashionable requisites london with whom you
must also become acquainted there is no such thing as doing without
them dress and address are indispensables this is no other than one 
the decorators
decorators continued bob not exactly comprehending him
monsieur le tailleur tin mr w from cork street come to
exhibit his spring patterns and turn us out with the new cut so pray
remain where you are
tailor decorator said bob egad the idea is almost as ridiculous
as the representation the taylor riding to brentford
by this time the door was opened and mr w entered making his bow
with the precision a dancingmaster and was followed by a servant
with patternbooks the other apparatus his trade the first
salutations over large patternbooks were displayed upon the table
exhibiting to view a variety fancycoloured cloths and measures
taken accordingly during which time tom as on the former occasion
continued his enquiries relative to the occurrences in the fashionable
world
rather tame sir at present the queen's unexpected visit to the two
theatres was for a time a matter surprise the backwardness drury
lane managers to produce god save the king has been construed into
disloyalty to the sovereign and a laughable circumstance took place on
his going to the same house a few nights back which has already been
made the subject much merriment both in conversation and caricature
it appears that mr gloss'em who is a shining character in the
theatrical world at least among the minors the metropolis and whose
father was for many years a waxchandler in the neighbourhood soho
holds a situation as clerk the cheque to the gentlemen pensioners
 his majesty's household as well as that major domo manager and
proprietor a certain theatre not half a mile from waterloo bridge
a part his duty in the former capacity is to attend occasionally
upon the person the king as one the appendages royalty in
which character he appeared on the night in question the servants
 the attendants who were in waiting for their masters had a room
appropriated to their use one these latter gentry no other than
gloss'em's servant being anxious to have as near a view the sacred
person his majesty as his employer had placed himself in a good
situation at the door in order to witness his departure when a mr
winpebble mismanaging notoriety and also a ponderous puff assuming
managerial authority espying him desired the policeofficers and
guards in attendance to turn out the lamplighter's boy pointing to
gloss'em's servant this it seems was no sooner said than done at the
point the bayonet some little scuffle ensued his majesty and suite
departed hold up your arm sir
but did the matter there enquired dashall
o dear no not exactly
because if it did continued tom in my opinion it began with a wax
taper and ended in the smoke a farthing rush light you have made it
appear to be a gasreceiver without supplies
i beg pardon said mr w the pipes are full but the gas is not yet
turned on
this created a laugh and mr w proceeded
the next day the servant having informed his master the treatment
he had received a gentleman was dispatched from gloss'em to winpebble
to demand an apology which being refused the former with a large
horsewhip under his arm accosted the latter and handsomely belaboured
his shoulders with lusty stripes that you see sir sets the gas all
in a blaze that will do sir now sir at your service addressing
himself to tallyhoho
yes said tom the taper's alight again now and pray what was the
consequence
winpebble called for assistance which was soon obtained and away they
went to bowstreet manager taper and manager vapour the one blazing
with fire and the other exhausted with thrashing twas a laughing
scene manager struts and manager butt were strutting and butting
each other the magistrate heard the case and recommended peace and
quietness between them by an amicable adjustment the irritated
minds the now two enraged managers could not be brought to consent
to this gloss'em declared the piece should be repeated having been
received with the most rapturous applause winpebble roundly swore that
the piece was ill got up badly represented and damn'd to all intents
and purposes that the author had more strength than wit and though
not a friend to injunctions himself he moved for an injunction against
gloss'em who was at length something like the renowned john ashley with
his imitator trees
this great john ashley and this little tommy trees were both bound
over to keep the king's peas
gloss'em was bound to keep the peace and compelled to find security
in the sum twenty pounds thus ended the farce the enraged
managers drury lane in a blaze or bow street bewildered 
ha ha ha an animated sort vehicle for public amusement truly
said tom and course produced with new scenery music dresses and
decorations forming a combination attractions superior to any ever
exhibited at any theatre egad it would make a most excellent scene ina
new pantomime
ha ha ha said mr w true sir true and the duel lord
shampetre would have also its due portion effect but as his
lordship is a good customer mine you must excuse any remarks on that
circumstance
we have already heard his lordship's undaunted courage and firmness
as well as the correctness his aim
he he he chuckled w then i fancy your information is not very
correct for it appears his lordship displayed a want every one 
those qualities that you impute to him however i venture to hope no
unpleasant measures will result from the occurrence as i made the very
pantaloons he wore upon the occasion it seems he is considerably cut
up but you must know that previous to the duel i was consulted
upon the best mode securing his sacred person from the effects a
bullet i recommended a very high waistband lined with whalebone and
well padded with horsehair to serve as a breastplate and calculated
at once to produce warmth and resist penetration the pantaloons
were accordingly made thickly overlaid with extremely rich and
expensive gold lace and considered to be stiff enough for anything
aye even to keep his lordship erect but what do you suppose was
the effect all my care i should not like to make a common talk
 it but so it certainly was his lordship had no objection to the
whalebone buckram c outside him but was fearful that if his
antagonist's fire should be welldirected his tender body might be
additionally hurt by the splinters the whalebone being carried along
with it and actually proposed to take them off before the dreadful hour
 appointment came on in this however he was fortunately overruled by
his second who by the by was but a goose in the affair and managed
it altogether very badly except in the instance being prompt with
the smellingbottle which certainly was welltimed and it would have
been a hissing hot business but for the judicious interference the
other second
a loud laugh succeeded this additional piece information relative
to the affair honour and snip having finished his measurement
colours were fixed upon and he departed promising to be punctual in
the delivery the new habiliments on the next day
i am now convinced said bob the great importance and utility 
a london tradesman and the speed their execution is wonderful
yes replied tom it is only to be equalled by the avidity with which
they obtain information and the rapidity with which they circulate
it why in another half hour your personal appearance the cut 
your country coat your complexion and character as far as so short
an interview would allow for obtaining it will be known to all his
customers they are generally quick and acute discerners but come
we must be making ready for our walk it is now halfpast ten
o'clock sparkle will be here presently it is time to be dressing as i
mean to have a complete ramble during the day take a chop somewhere
on the road and in the evening my boy we'll take a peep into the
theatre lord byron's tragedy marino falter is to be performed
tonight and i can i think promise you a treat the highest kind
tallyhoho who had no idea dressing again having already been obliged
to dress twice seemed a little surprised at the proposition but
supposing it to be the custom london nodded assent and
proceeded to the dressingroom as he walked up stairs he could not help
casting his visual orbs over the banisters just to take a bird's eye
view the scene his morning disasters which to his great
astonishment and surprise not a vestige remained a new lamp had been
procured which seemed to have arisen like a phoenix from its ashes and
the stone passage and stairs appeared as he termed it as white as a
cauliflower at the sight all this he was gratified and delighted
for he expected to find a heap ruins to reproach him he skipped or
rather vaulted up the stairs three or four at a stride with all the
gaiety a racehorse when first brought to the startingpost the
rapid movements a life in london at once astonished and enraptured
him nor did he delay his steps or his delight until he had reached
the topmost story when bursting open the door lie marched boldly into
the room here again he was at fault a female shriek assailed his ear
which stopped his course and looking around him he could not find from
whence the voice proceeded good god continued the same voice what
can be the meaning this intrusion begone rash man in the meantime
tom who was in a room just under the one into which he had
unfortunately made so sudden an entrance appeared at the door
what the devil is the matter now said tom when spying his cousin
in the centre the room without seeming to know whether to return or
remain he could not restrain his laughter tallyhoho looked up like one
in a dream then down then casting his eyes around him he perceived
in the corner peeping out from the bedcurtains in which she had
endeavoured to hide her almost naked person the head the old
housekeeper the picture was moving and at the same time laughable
the confusion bob the fright the housekeeper and the laughter 
tom were subjects for the pencil a hogarth
so said tom you are for springing game in all parts the house
and at all times too how came you here not by my appointment sir
replied the old lady who still remained rolled up in the curtain i
never did such a thing in all my born days i'm an honest woman and
mean to remain so i never was so ashamed in all my life
i believe the house is enchanted cried bob d me i never
seem to step without being on a barrel gunpowder ready to ignite
with the touch my foot i have made some cursed blunder again and
don't seem to know where i am
come come said dashall that won't do i'm sure you had some design
upon my housekeeper who you hear by her own account is a good woman
and won't listen to your advances
by this time the servants had arrived at the door and were alternately
peeping in wondering to see the two gentlemen in such a situation and
secretly giggling and enjoying the embarrassment the old woman
whose wig lay on the table and who was displaying her bald pate and
shrivelled features from the bedcurtains enveloped in fringe and
tassels which only served to render them still more ludicrous
bob affected to laugh said it was very odd he could not account for
it at all stammered out something like an apology begg'd pardon it
was a mistake he really took it for his own room he never was
so bewildered in his life was very sorry he should cause so much
alarm but really had no sort intention whatever
well said dashall the best reparation you can now make for your
intrusion is a speedy retreat time is escaping so come along and
taking him by the arm they walked down the stairs together and then
proceeded to refit without further obstruction in order to be ready
for sparkle who was expected every minute
the first day bob's residence in london had already been productive
 some curious adventures in which he unfortunately as he considered
had sustained the principal character a character not altogether
suitable to is inclinations or wishes though productive much
merriment to his ever gay and sprightly cousin who had witnessed the
embarrassment his pupil upon his first entrance into life with
ungovernable laughter it was to him excellent sport while it furnished
a good subject speculation and conversation among the servants below
but was not so well relished by the affrighted old housekeeper indeed
the abrupt entrance a man into her bedchamber had so deranged her
ideas that she was longer than usual in decking her person previous to
her reappearance the tender frame the old lady had been
subjected to serious agitations at the bare idea such a visit and
the probable imputations that might in consequence be thrown upon her
sacred and unspotted character nor could she for some time recover her
usual serenity
such was the situation the parties at the moment we are now
describing but as our heroes are preparing for an extensive actual
survey men manners and tidings we shall for the present leave them
in peace and quietness while we proceed to the next chapter
chapter vii
what shows and what sights what a round delights
you'll meet in the gay scene london
how charming to view amusements still new
twenty others you'll find soon as one's done
at the gay scene at court peers and gentry resort
in pleasure you'll never miss one day
there's the opera treat the parade in bond street
and the crowd in hyde park on a sunday
tom whose wardrobe was extensive found no difficulty and lost no
time in preparing for the promenade while on the other hand tallyhoho
was perplexed to know how to tog himself out in a way suitable to
make his appearance in the gay world fashion dashall had therefore
rapidly equipped himself when perceiving it was halfpast eleven
he was the more perplexed to account for the absence sparkle for
although it was an early hour yet upon such an occasion as that 
initiating a new recruit it was very extraordinary that he should not
have been prompt however he entered tallyhoho's room and found him
looking out the window in a posture rumination probably revolving
in his mind the events the morning
come said tom as he entered tis time to be on the move and if
sparkle don't show in a few minutes we'll set sail and call in upon him
at long's in bond street perhaps he is not well or something prevents
his appearance we'll make it in our way and we have a fine day before
us
i am at your service replied bob who could not help viewing the
elegance his cousin's appearance the style his dress and the
neatness with which his garments fitted him were all subjects 
admiration and formed so strong a contrast with his own as almost
to excite envy he had however attired himself in a way that befits a
fashionable country gentleman a green coat white waistcoat buckskin
breeches and boots over which a pair leggings appeared which
extended below the calf the leg and half up the thigh surmounted
with a lily shallow such was the costume in which he was destined to
show off and thus equipped after a few minutes they emerged from the
house in piccadilly on the proposed ramble and proceeded towards bond
street
the first object that took their particular attention was the burlington
arcade come said tom we may as well go this way and immediately
they passed the man in the goldlaced hat who guards the entrance to
prevent the admission boys and improper persons the display the
shops with the sun shining through the windows above afforded much for
observation and attracted bob from side to side to look to wonder and
admire but tom who was intent upon finding his friend sparkle urged
the necessity moving onward with more celerity lest he should begone
out and consequently kept drawing his cousin forward another and
a better opportunity will be afforded for explanation than the present
and as speed is the order the day i hope you will not prove
disorderly we shall soon reach long's and when we have sparkle with
us we have one the most intelligent and entertaining fellows in
the world he is a sort index to every thing and every body his
knowledge life and character together with a facetiousness 
whim and manner which he has in delineating them are what we call
in london prime and bang up to the mark there is scarcely a lane
court alley or street in the metropolis but what he knows from the
remotest corners ragfair to the open and elegant squares the
west even to hyde park corner memory mirth and magic seem at all
times to animate his tongue and as the song says
he is the hoy for bewitching em
whether goodhumour'd or coy
indeed he is the admiration all who know him wit whim frolic
and fun are constant companions with him and i really believe in a
dungeon or a palace he would always appear the same
by this time they had reached bond street in their way to which
each step they had taken the streets and avenues every description
appeared to bob to be crowded to an excess the mingling cries which
were vociferated around them produced in his mind uncommon
sensations the rattling the carriages the brilliance the shops
and the continual hum the passengers contributed to heighten the
scene
bond street said dashall is not one the most elegant streets
in the vicinity london but is the resort the most fashionable
people and from about two o'clock till five it is all bustle all
life every species fashionable vehicle is to be seen dashing
along in gay and gallant pride from two to five are the fashionable
shoppinghours for which purpose the first families resort to this
wellknown street others to shew their equipage make an assignation
or kill a little time which is as much a business with some as is the
more careful endeavours others to seize him in his flight and make
the most his presence the throng is already increasing the variety
richness and gaiety the shops in this street will always be
attractive and make it a popular rendezvous both sexes it will
shortly be as crowded as rag fair or the royal exchange and the magic
splendour has very peculiar properties
it makes the tradesman forget while he is cheating a lovely and
smiling duchess that in all probability her ladyship is endeavouring to
cheat him it makes the gay and airy the furrowed and painted lady 
the town forget that she must pay a visit to her uncle in order
to raise the wind before she can make her appearance at the theatre
at halfprice it makes the dashing prisoner forget that while he
is sporting his figure in the bangup style appearance he is only
taking his ride on a dayrule from the king's bench it makes the lord
who drives fourinhand forget his losses the night before at some 
the fashionable gaminghouses it makes one adventurer forget that the
clothes in which he expects to obtain respect and attention are more
than likely to be paid for in newgate another for a time forgets that
john doe and richard roe have expelled him from his
 my uncle is a very convenient and accommodating sort 
friend who lives at the sign the three balls indicative
 his willingness to lend money upon good security for the
payment enormous interest the original meaning the
sign has puzzled the curious and antiquarians and the only
probable meaning they can discover is that it implies the
chances are two to one against any property being redeemed
after being once committed to the keeping this tenderhearted
and affectionate relative
lodgings and a third that all his worldly possessions are not equal
to the purchase a dinner it is an ignis fatuus a sort magic
lantern replete with delusive appearances momentary duration an
escape to the regions noise tumult vanity and frivolity where the
realities life the circumstances and the situation the observer
are not suffered to intrude
but to be seen in this street at a certain hour is one the
essentials to the existence hautton it is the point attraction
for greetings in splendid equipages from the haughty bend or familiar
nod arrogance to the humble bow servility here mimicry without
money assumes the consequential air independence while modest merit
creeps along unheeded through the glittering crowd here all the senses
are tantalized with profusion and the eye is dazzled with temptation
for no other reason than because it is the constant business a
fashionable life not to live in but out self to imitate the
luxuries the affluent without a tithe their income and to
sacrifice morality at the altar notoriety
your description this celebrated street which i have heard so
much said tallyhoho is truly lively
but it is strictly true continued tom
they had now arrived at long's and found a barouche and four waiting at
the door upon entering the first person they met was lord cripplegate
whom they passed and proceeded to the coffeeroom in one the
boxes which tom immediately directed his cousin's attention to a
welldressed young man who was reading the newspaper and sipping his
coffee take notice him said tom
bob looked at him for a moment marked his features and his dress
which was in the extreme fashion while tom turning to one the
waiters enquired for his friend sparkle
he has not been here since yesterday morning said the waiter
i have been waiting for him these two hours exclaimed the young sprig
 fashion laying down the newspaper almost at the same moment and
must wait till he comes ah mr dashall how d'ye dovery glad to
see you left all well in the country i hope mr sparkle was to have
met me this morning at eleven precisely i should judge he is gone into
the country
it must have been late last night then said dashall for he
left us about halfpast ten and promised also to meet us again this
morning at eleven i can't think what can have become him but come
said he taking bob by the arm we must keep moving good morning good
morning and thus saying walked directly out the house turning to
the right again towards piccadilly
there is a remark made i think by goldsmith said tom that one half
 the world don't know how the other half lives and the man i spoke to
in the coffeeroom whose name i am unacquainted with though his person
is recognized by almost every body while his true character residence
and means subsistence remain completely in obscurity from what i
have seen him i judge is what may be termed a hanger on 
a hanger on said bob what can that mean i took him for a man 
property and high birth but i saw you take so little notice him
ah my good fellow i have already cautioned you not to be duped by
appearances a hanger on is a sort sycophant or toadeater
and in the coffeehouses and hotels london many such are to be
found men who can spin out a long yarn tell a tough story and
tip you a rum chant who invite themselves by a freedom address
bordering on impudence to the tables and the parties persons they
know by pretending to call in by mere accident just at the appointed
time by assuming great confidence great haste little appetite and
much business but at the same time requiring but little pressure to
forego them all for the pleasure the company present what he
can have to do with sparkle i am at a loss to conceive but he is an
insinuating and an intriguing sort fellow whom i by no means like
so i cut him
bob did not exactly understand the meaning the word cut and
therefore begged his cousin to explain
the cut said tom is a fashionable word for getting rid by rude
or any means any person whose company is not agreeable the art 
cutting is reduced to a system in london and an explanatory treatise
has been written on the subject for the edification the natives
but i am so bewildered to think what can have detained sparkle and
deprived us his company that i scarcely know how to think for a
moment on any other subject at present
 vide a small volume entitled the cutter
it is somewhat strange cried bob that he was not with you this
morning
there is some mystery in it said tom which time alone can unravel
but however we will not be deprived our intended ramble at this
moment they entered piccadilly and were crossing the road in their way
to st james's street when dashall nodded to a gentleman passing by on
the opposite side and received a sort half bow in return that
said tom is a curious fellow and a devilish clever fellow too for
although he has but one arm he is a man science
in what way enquired bob
he is a pugilist said tom one those courageous gentlemen who can
queer the daylight tap the claret prevent telling fibs and pop the
noddle into chancery and a devilish good hand he is i can assure you
among those who
can combat with ferocious strife
and beat an eye out or thump out a life
can bang the ribs in or bruise out the brains
and die like noble blockheads for their pains
illustration pages fives court
having but one arm course he is unable to figure in the
ring though he attends the mills and is a constant visitor at the
fives court exhibitions and generally appears a la beecher he prides
himself upon flooring a novice and hits devilish hard with the glove i
have had some lessons from this amateur the old english science and
felt the force his fist but it is a very customary thing to commence
in a friendly way till the knowing one finds an opportunity which he
cannot resist shewing the superiority he possesses so it was with
harry and me when he put on his glove i use the singular number
because he has but one hand whereon to place a glove withal come said
he it shall only be a little innocent spar i also put on a glove
for it would not be fair to attack a onearmed man with two and no one
ought to take the odds in combat to it we went and i shewed first
blood for he tapped the claret in no time
neat milling we had what with clouts on the nob home hits in
the breadbasket clicks in the gob and plumps in the daylight a
prettier treat between two johnny raws tis not easy to meet
i profited however by harry's lessons and after a short time was
enabled to return the compliment with interest by sewing up one his
glimmers 
this is st james's street continued he as they turned the corner
rather short in doing which somewhat animated by the description he
had just been giving tom's foot caught the toe a gentleman who
was mincing along the pathway with all the care and precision a
dancingmaster which had the effect bringing him to the ground in an
instant as effectually as a blow from one the fancy tom who had
no intention giving offence wantonly apologized for the misfortune
by i beg pardon sir while bob who perceived the poor creature was
unable to rise again and apprehending some broken bones assisted him
to regain his erect position the poor animal or nondescript yclept
dandy however had only been prevented the exercise its limbs by the
stiffness certain appendages without which its person could not be
complete the stays lined with whalebone were the obstacles to its
rising being however placed in its natural position he began in an
affected blustering tone voice to complain that it was d d odd
a gentleman could not walk along the streets without being incommoded
by puppies pulled out his quizzing glass and surveyed our heroes from
head to foot then taking from his pocket a smelling bottle which by
application to the nose appeared to revive him tom declared he was
sorry for the accident had no intention and hoped he was not hurt
this however did not appear to satisfy the offended dandy who turned
upon his heel muttering to himself the necessity there was preventing
drunken fellows from rambling the streets to the annoyance sober and
genteel people in the daytime
dashall who overheard the substance his ejaculation broke from the
arm bob and stepping after him without ceremony by a sudden wheel
placed himself in the front him so as to impede his progress a
second time a circumstance which filled mr fribble with additional
alarm and his agitation became visibly depicted on his countenance
what do you mean cried dashall with indignation taking the
imputation drunkenness at that early hour in dudgeon who and
what are you sir explain instantly or by the honour a
gentleman i'll chastise this insolence
 what are you is a formidable question to a dandy the
present day for
dandy's a gender the doubtful kind
a something nothing not to be defined
twould puzzle worlds its sex to ascertain
so very empty and so very vain
it is a fact that the following examination three 
these nondescripts took place at bow street a very short
time back in consequence a nocturnal fracas the report
was thus given
three young sprigs fashion in full dress somewhat
damaged and discoloured by a night's lodging in the cell 
a watchhouse were yesterday brought before mr birnie
charged with disorderly conduct in the streets and with
beating a watchman named lloyd
lloyd stated that his beat was near the piazza and at a
very late hour on thursday night the three defendants came
through covent garden singing and conducting themselves in
the most riotous manner possible they were running and
were followed by three others all in a most uproarious
state intoxication and he thought proper to stop them
upon which he was floored sanceremonie and when he
recovered his legs he was again struck and called a b y
charley and other ungenteel names he called for
the assistance some his brethren and the defendants
were with some trouble taken to the watchhouse they were
very jolly on the way and when lodged in durance amused
themselves with abusing the constable the night and took
especial care that no one within hearing the watchhouse
should get a wink sleep for the remainder the night
mr birnie well young gentleman what have you to say to
this the one who undertook to be spokesman threw himself
in the most familiar manner possible across the table and
having fixed himself perfectly at his ease he said the
fact was they had been dining at a tavern and were rather
drunk and on their way through the piazza they endeavoured
by running away to give the slip to their three companions
who were still worse than themselves the others however
called out stop thief and the watchman stopped them
whereat they naturally felt irritated and certainly gave
the watchman a bit a thrashing
mr birnie how was he to know you were not the thieves
he did quite right to stop you and i am very glad he has
brought you here pray sir what are you defendant i
am nothing sir mr birnie to another and what are
you defendant why sir i am i am sir nothing mr
birnie well this is very fine pray sir turning to
the third who stood twirling his hat will you do me the
favour to tell what you are
this gentleman answered in the same way i am as my
friends observed nothing
mr birnie well gentlemen i must endeavour to make
something you here gaoler let them he locked up and i
shall not part with them until i have some better account 
their occupations
we have heard it asserted that nine tailors make a man how
many dandies professing to be nothing may be required to
accomplish the proposed intention making something may
perhaps by this time be discovered by the worthy
magistrate we however suspect he has had severe work it
leave me alone exclaimed the almost petrified dandy
not till you have given me the satisfaction i have a right to demand
cried tom i insist upon an explanation and apology or demand your
card who are you sir that's my address instantly handing him a
card i am not to be played with nor will i suffer your escape after
the insulting manner in which you have spoken with impunity
though not prepared for such a rencontre the dandy who now perceived
the inflexible temper tom's mind and a crowd people gathering
round him determined at least to put on as much the character a
man as possible and fumbled in his pocket for a card at length finding
one he slipped it into tom's hand oh sir said he if that's the
case i'm your man demise how when or where you please pon
honor then beckoning to a hackney coach he hobbled to the door
and was pushed in by coaches who immediately mounted the box and
flourishing his whip soon rescued him from his perilous situation and
the jeers the surrounding multitude
tom who in the bustle the crowd had slipped the card his
antagonist into his pocket now took bob's arm and they pursued their
way down st james's street and could not help laughing at the affair
but tallyhoho who had a great aversion to duelling and was thinking 
the consequences bit his lips and expressed his sorrow at what
had occurred he ascribed the hasty imputation drunkenness to the
irritating effects the poor creature's accident and expressed his
hope that his cousin would take no further notice it tom however
on the other hand ridiculed bob's fears told him it was a point
 honour not to suffer an insult in the street from any man nor would
he besides the charge drunkenness from such a thing as that is not
to be borne d n it man drunkenness in the early part the day
is a thing i abhor it is at all times what i would avoid if possible
but at night there may be many apologies for it nay in some cases even
to avoid it is impossible the pleasures society are enhanced
by it the joys love are increased by the circulation the
glass harmony conviviality and friendship are produced by it though i
am no advocate for inebriety and detest the idea the beast
who clouds his reason by the light day
and falls to drink an early and an easy prey
well said bob i cannot help thinking this poor fellow who has
already betrayed his fears will be inclined to make any apology for his
rudeness tomorrow
if he does not said tom i'll wing him to a certainty a
jackanapes a puppy a manmilliner perhaps a thing shreds and
patches he shall not go unpunished i promise you so come along we
will just step in here and i'll dispatch this business at once i'll
write a challenge and then it will be off my hands and so saying
they entered a coffeehouse where calling for pen ink and paper tom
immediately began his epistle shrewdly hinting to his cousin that he
expected he would act as his second it will be a fine opportunity for
introducing your name to the gay world the newspapers will record your
name as a man ton let us see now how it will appear on last
the honourable tom dashall attended by his cousin robert tallyhoho esq
 belleville hall met ah by the bye let us see who he is here he
felt in his pocket for the card
bob however declared his wish to decline obtaining popularity by being
present upon such an occasion and suggested the idea his calling
upon the offender and endeavouring to effect an amicable arrangement
between them
hallo exclaimed tom with surprise as he drew the card from his
pocket and threw it on the table ha ha ha look at that
tallyhoho looked at the card without understanding it what does it
mean said he
mean replied tom why it is a pawnbroker's duplicate for a
hunting watch deposited with his uncle this morning in st martin's
lane for two pounds laughable enough well you may dismiss your fears
for the present but i'll try if i can't find my man by this means if
he is worth finding at all events we have found a watch
bob now joined in the laugh and having satisfied the waiter they
sallied forth again
just as they left the coffeehouse do you see that gentleman in the
blue great coat arm in arm with another that is no other than the
you would scarcely conceive by his present appearance that
he has commanded armies and led them on to victory and that having
retired under the shade his laurels he is withering them away
leaf by leaf by attendance at the hells the metropolis his
unconquerable spirit still actuating him in his hours relaxation it
is said that the immense sum awarded to him for his prowess in war
has been so materially reduced by his inordinate passion for play that
although he appears at court and is a favourite the demon poverty
stares him in the face but this is a vile world and half one hears is
not to be believed he is certainly extravagant fond women and fond
 wine but all these foibles are overshadowed with so much glory as
scarcely to remain perceptible here is the palace said tom directing
his cousin's attention to the bottom the street
bob was evidently struck at this piece information as he could
discover no mark grandeur in its appearance to entitle it to the
dignity a royal residence
it is true said tom the outside appearance is not much in its
favour but it is venerable for its antiquity and for its being till
lately the place at which the kings this happy island have held their
courts on the site that palace originally stood an hospital
founded before the conquest for fourteen leprous females to whom eight
brethren were afterwards added to assist in the performance divine
service
very necessary said bob and yet scarcely sufficient
 hells the abode or resort blacklegs or gamblers
where they assemble to commit their depredations on the
unwary but these we shall have occasion to enlarge
elsewhere
you seem to quiz this palace and are inclined to indulge your wit
upon old age in it was surrendered to henry viii and he erected
the present palace and enclosed st james's park to serve as a place
 amusement and exercise both to this palace and whitehall but it
does not appear to have been the court the english sovereigns during
their residence in town till the reign queen ann from which time it
has been uniformly used as such
it is built brick and that part which contains the state
apartments being only one story high gives it a regular appearance
outside the staterooms are commodious and handsome although there is
nothing very superb or grand in the decorations or furniture
the entrance to these rooms is by a staircase which opens into the
principal court which you now see at the top the staircase are
two rooms one on the left called the queen's and the other the king's
guardroom leading to the stateapartments immediately beyond the
king's guardroom is the presencechamber which contains a canopy
and is hung with tapestry and which is now used as a passage to the
principal rooms
there is a suite five rooms opening into each other successively
fronting the park the presencechamber opens into the centre room
which is denominated the privychamber in which is a canopy 
floweredcrimson velvet generally made use for the king to receive
the quakers
on the right are two drawingrooms one within the other at the upper
 the further one is a throne with a splendid canopy on which the
kings have been accustomed to receive certain addresses this is called
the grand drawingroom and is used by the king and queen on certain
state occasions the nearer room being appropriated as a kind 
antechamber in which the nobility c are permitted to remain while
their majesties are present in the further room and is furnished with
stools sofas c for the purpose there are two leveerooms on the
left the privychamber on entering from the king's guardroom and
presencechamber the nearer one serving as an antechamber to the
other they were all them formerly meanly furnished but at the
time the marriage our present king they were elegantly fitted
up the walls are now covered with tapestry very beautiful and rich
colours tapestry which although it was made for charles had
never been used having by some accident lain unnoticed in a chest till
it was discovered a short time before the marriage the prince
the canopy the throne was made for the latequeen's birthday the
first which happened after the union great britain and ireland it
is made crimson velvet with very broad gold lace embroidered with
crowns set with fine and rich pearls the shamrock emblematical the
irish nation forms a part the decorations the british crown and
is executed with great taste and accuracy
the grand drawingroom contains a large magnificent chandelier 
silver gilt but i believe it has not been lighted for some years and
in the grand leveeroom is a very noble bed the furniture which is
 spitalfields manufacture in crimson velvet it was first put up with
the tapestry on the marriage the present king then prince wales
it is upon the whole an irregular building chiefly consisting 
several courts and alleys which lead into the park this however is
the age improvement and it is said that the palace will shortly
be pulled down and in the front st james's street a magnificent
triumphal arch is to be erected to commemorate the glorious victories
 the late war and to form a grand entrance to the park
the duke york the duke clarence the king's servants and many
other dignified persons live in the stableyard
in the stableyard said bob dignified persons reside in a
stableyard you astonish me
it is quite true said tom and remember it is the stableyard a
king
i forgot that circumstance said bob and that circumstances alter
cases but whose carriage is this driving with so much rapidity
that is his highness the duke york most likely going to pay a visit
to his royal brother the king who resides in a palace a little further
on which will be in our way for it is yet too early to see much in
the park so let us proceed i am anxious to make some inquiry about
my antagonist and therefore mean to take st martin's lane as we go
along
with this they pursued their way along pall mall the rapidity tom's
movements however afforded little opportunity for observation or remark
till they arrived opposite carlton house when he called his
cousin's attention to the elegance the new streets opposite to it
that said he is waterloo place which as well as the memorable
battle after which it is named has already cost the nation an immense
sum money and must cost much more before the proposed improvements
are completed it is however the most elegant street in london the
want uniformity the buildings has a striking effect and gives it
the appearance a number palaces in the time queen elizabeth
there were no such places as pall mall st james'sstreet piccadilly
nor any the streets or fine squares in this part the town that
building at the farther is now the british fireoffice and has a
pleasing effect at this distance the cupola on the left belongs to a
chapel the interior which for elegant simplicity is unrivalled to
the left the centre building is a circus and a serpentine street
not yet finished which runs to swallow street and thence directly
to oxford road where another circus is forming and is intended to
communicate with portland place by which means a line street
composed all new buildings will be completed this dull looking
place turning to carlton house although it is the townresidence
 our king i shall say nothing at present as i intend devoting a
morning along with you to its inspection the exterior has not the
most lively appearance but the interior is magnificent during this
conversation they had kept moving gently on
illustration pages the kings levee
bob was charmed with the view down waterloo place
that said his cousin pointing to the arcade at the opposite corner
 pall mall is the italian operahouse which has recently assumed
its present superb appearance and may be ranked among the finest
buildings in london it is devoted to the performance italian operas
and french ballets is generally open from december to july and
is attended by the most distinguished and fashionable persons the
improvements in this part are great that church which you see in the
distance over the tops the houses is st martin's in the fields
in the fields inquired bob what then are we come to the the
town
ha ha ha cried tom the no no i was going to say
there is no to it no we have not reached any thing like the
centre
blood an owns moderation and blarney said an irishman at that
moment passing them with a hod mortar on his shoulder towards the
new buildings and leaving an ornamental patch as he went along on bob's
shoulder but i'll be after tipping turnips l to any b dy
rogue that's tip to saying black's the white the blue part pat
murphy's eye and for that there matter dropping the hod mortar
almost on their toes at the same time and turning round to bob by the
powers i ax the jontleman's pardon tho he's not the first jontleman
that has carried mortar where is that big bullyfaced blackguard
that i'm looking after during this he brushed the mortar off tallyhoho's
coat with a snap his fingers regardless where or on whom he
distributed it
the offender it seemed had taken flight while pat was apologizing and
was no where to be found
why what's the matter inquired tom you seem in a passion
och not in the least bit your honour i'm only in a d d rage by
the mug my mother arn't it a great shame that a jontleman 
ireland can't walk the streets london without having potatoes and
buttermilk throned in his gums hitching up the waistband his
breeches it won't do at all at all for pat its a reflection on my own
native land where
is hospitality
all reality
no formality
there you ever see
the free and easy
would so amaze ye
you'd think us all crazy
for dull we never be
these lines sung with an irish accent to the tune morgan rattler
accompanied with a snapping his fingers and concluded with a
something in imitation 
 tipping turnips this is a phrase made use among the
rigging fraternity to signify a turnup which is to
knock down
an irish jilt were altogether so truly characteristic the
nation to which he belonged as to afford our heroes considerable
amusement tom threw him a halfcrown which he picked up with more
haste than he had thrown down the mortar in his rage
long life and good luck to the jontleman said pat sure enough
i won't be after drinking health and success to your honour's pretty
picture and the devil pitch into his own cabin the fellow that would
be after picking a hole or clapping a dirty patch on the coat st
patrick whiskey for ever your honour huzza
a drop good whiskey
would make a man frisky
by this time a crowd was gathering round them and tom cautioned bob ina
whisper to beware his pockets this piece advice however came
too late for his blue bird's eye wipe l had taken flight
what said bob is this done in open day are you all right and
tight elsewhere said tom if you are toddle on and say nothing about
it open day continued he aye the system rigging 
 blue bird's eye wipe a blue pocket handkerchief with
white spots
 a cant term for all sorts thieving the life the
celebrated george barrington old bailey notoriety is
admirably illustrative this art which by a more recent
development hardy vaux appears to be almost reduced to
a system notwithstanding the wholesomeness our laws and
the vigilance our police in their administration however
incredible it may appear such is the force habit and
association the latter notwithstanding he was detected and
transported contrived to continue his depredations during
his captivity returned at the expiration his term to
his native land and his old pursuits was transported a
second time suffered flogging and imprisonmeets without
correcting what cannot but be termed the vicious
propensities his nature he generally spent his mornings
in visiting the shops jewellers watchmakers
pawnbrokers c depending upon his address and appearance
and determining to make the whole circuit the metropolis
and not to omit a single shop in either those branches
this scheme he actually executed so fully that he believes
he did not leave ten untried in london for he made a point
 commencing early every day and went regularly through
it taking both sides the way his practice on entering a
shop was to request to look at gold seals chains
brooches rings or any other small articles value
and while examining them and looking the shopkeeper in the
face he contrived by sleight hand to conceal two or
three sometimes more as opportunities offered in the
sleeve his coat which was purposely made wide in this
practice he succeeded to a very great extent and in the
course his career was never once detected in the fact
though on two or three occasions so much suspicion arose
that he was obliged to exert all his effrontery and to use
very high language in order as the cant phrase is to
bounce the tradesman out it his fashionable appearance
and affected anger at his insinuations always had the
effect inducing an apology and in many such cases he has
actually carried away the spoil notwithstanding what passed
between them and even gone so far as to visit the same shop
again a second and a third time with as good success as at
first this with his nightly attendance at the theatres and
places public resort where he picked pockets watches
snuffboxes c was for a length time the sole business
 his life he was however secured after secreting himself
for a time convicted and is now transported for life ashe
conceives sold by another celebrated prig whose real
name was bill white but better known by the title coney
beau
will be acted on sometimes by the very party you are speaking
to the expertness with which it is done is almost beyond belief
bob having ascertained that his handkerchief was the extent his loss
they pursued their way towards charing cross
a line street is intended continued tom to be made from the
opera house to terminate with that church and here is the king's mews
which is now turned into barracks
stop thief stop thief was at this moment vociferated in their ears
by a variety voices and turning round they perceived a welldressed
man at full speed followed pretty closely by a concourse people ina
moment the whole neighbourhood appeared to be in alarm the upstairs
windows were crowded with females the tradesmen were at their
shopdoors the passengers were huddled together in groups inquiring 
each other what is the matter who is it which is him what has he
done while the pursuers were increasing in numbers as they went the
bustle the scene was new to bob charing cross and its vicinity was
all in motion
come said tom let us see the this they are sure to nab l
my gentleman before he gets much
 nabbed or nibbled secured or taken
farther so let us brush on then pulling his cousin by the
arm they moved forward to the scene action
as they approached st martin's lane the gathering the crowd which
was now immense indicated to tom a capture
button up said he and let us see what's the matter
arrah be easy cried a voice which they instantly recognized to be no
other than pat murphy's i'll hold you my dear till the night after
doomsday though i can't tell what day the year that is where's the
man wit the gouldlaced skullcap sure enough i thought i'd be up wi
you and so now you see i'm down upon you
at this moment a streetkeeper made way through the crowd and tom
and bob keeping close in his rear came directly up to the principal
performers in this interesting scene and found honest pat murphy
holding the man by his collar while he was twisting and writhing to get
released from the strong and determined grasp the athletic hibernian
pat no sooner saw our heroes than he burst out with a lusty arrow
arrow there's the sweetlooking gentleman that's been robbed by a dirty
spalpeen that's not worth the tail a rotten redherring i'll give
charge dis here pick'd whalebone a dead donkey that walks about in
god's own daylight darting his fingers wit what don't belong to him at
all at all so sure as the devil's in his own house and that's london
you've had your pocket pick'd my darling and that's news well worth
hearing addressing himself to dashall
by this harangue it was pretty clearly understood that murphy had been
in pursuit the pickpocket and tom immediately gave charge
the man however continued to declare he was not the right
person that so help him g d the irishman had got the wrong
bull by the tail that he was a b dy snitch and that he would
sarve him out that he wished
 brush be off
 snitch a term made use by the lightfingered tribe
to signify an informer by whom they have been impeached or
betrayed so a person who turns king's evidence against his
accomplices is called a snitch
 serve him out to punish or be revenged upon any person
for any real or supposed injury
he might meet him out st giles's and he would wake him
with an irish howl 
 wake with an irish howl an irish wake which is no
unfrequent occurrence in the neighbourhood st giles's
and saffron hill is one the most comically serious
ceremonies which can well be conceived and certainly
baffles all powers description it is however
considered indispensable to wake the body a deceased
native the sister kingdom which is by a sort mock
lying in state to which all the friends relatives and
fellow countrymen and women the dead person are
indiscriminately admitted and among the low irish this duty
is frequently performed in a cellar upon which occasions
the motley group assembled hibernian would form a
subject for the pencil the most able satirist
upon one these occasions when murtoch mulrooney who had
suffered the sentence the law by the common hangman fora
footpad robbery an englishman was induced by a friend 
the deceased to accompany him and has left on record the
following account his entertainment
when we had descended says he about a dozen steps we
found ourselves in a subterraneous region but fortunately
not uninhabited on the right sat three old bawds drinking
whiskey and smoking tobacco out pipes about two inches
long by which means i conceive their noses had become
red and swearing and blasting between each puff i was
immediately saluted by one the most sober the ladies
and invited to take a glass the enlivening nectar and
led to the bed exactly opposite the door where murtoch was
laid out and begged to pray for the repose his precious
should this however i declined alleging that as the
parsons were paid for praying it was their proper business
at this moment a coarse female voice exclaimed in a sort 
yell or irish howl arrah by jesus and why did you die
honey sure enough it was not for the want milk meal
or toes
in a remote corner the room or rather cellar sat three
draymen five his majesty's body guards four sailors
six haymakers eight chairmen and six evidence makers
together with three bailiffs followers who came by turns
to view the body and take a drop the cratur to drink
repose to the should their countryman and to complete the
group they were attended by the journeyman jack ketch the
noise and confusion were almost stupefying there were
praying swearing cryinghowling smoking and drinking
at the head the bed where the remains murtoch were
laid was the picture the virgin mary on one side and
that st patrick on the other and at the feet was
depicted the devil and some his angels with the blood
running down their backs from the flagellations which they
had received from the disciples ketigern whether the
blue devils were flying around or not i could not exactly
discover but the whiskey and blue ruin were evidently
powerful in their effects
one was swearing a second counting his beads a
third descanting on the good qualities his departed
friend and about to try those the whiskey a fourth
evacuating that load with which he had already overloaded
himself a fifth declaring he could carry a fare hear
mass knock down a member parliament murder a peace
officer and after all receive a pension and while the
priest was making an assignation with a sprightly female
sprig shelalah another was genteelly picking his pocket
i had seen enough and having no desire to continue in such
company made my escape with as much speed as i could from
this animated group persons assembled as they were upon
so solemn an occasion
with conversation this kind the party were amused up st
martin's lane and on the remainder the road to bowstreet followed
by many persons some whom pretended to have seen a part the
proceedings and promised to give their evidence before the magistrate
who was then sitting
on arriving in bow street they entered the brown bear a
publichouse much frequented by the officers and in which is a
strongroom for the safe custody prisoners where they were shewn
into a dark backparlour as they termed it and the officer proceeded
to search the man in custody when lo and behold the handkerchief was
not to be found about him
pat d d the devil and all his works swore by the fiery furnace 
beelzebub and that's the devil's own bedchamber that was the man
that nibbled the jontleman's dive and must have tinged away the
wipe or else what should he bolt for that he was up to the
rum slum 
 a former landlord the house facetiously christened it
the russian hotel and had the words painted under the sign
 bruin
 nibbled the jontleman's dive picked the gentleman's
pocket
 dined away the wipe passed away the handkerchief to
another to escape detection this is a very common practice
in london two or three in a party will be near without
appearing to have the least knowledge or connexion with
each other and the moment a depredation is committed by
one he transfers the property to one his pals by whom
it is conveyed perhaps to the third who decamps with it to
some receiver who will immediately advance money upon it
while if any suspicion should fall upon the first the
second will perhaps busy himself in his endeavours to secure
the offender well knowing no proof possession can be
brought against him
 bolt run away try to make an escape
 rum slum gammon queer talk or action in which some
fraudulent intentions are discoverable or suspected
and down upon the kiddies and sure enough you're boned 
my dear boy
some the officers came in and appeared to know the prisoner well
as if they had been acquainted with each other upon former official
business but as the lost property was not found upon him it was the
general opinion that nothing could be done and the accused began to
exercise his wit upon murphy which roused pat's blood
for the least thing you know makes an irishman roar
at length upon charging him with having been caught bluepigeon
flying pat gave him the lie in his teeth swore he'd fight him for
all the blunt he had about him which to be sure said he is
but a sweet pretty halfacrown and be d d to you good luck
to it here goes throwing the halfcrown upon the floor which the
prisoner attempted to pick up but was prevented by pat's stamping his
foot upon it while he was doffing his jacket exclaiming
arrah be after putting your dirty fingers in your pocket and don't
spoil the king's picture by touching it devil burn me but i'll mill
your mug to muffin dust before i'll give up that beautiful looking
bit so tip us your mauley and no more blarney
 down upon the kiddies to understand the arts and
manouvres thieves and sharpers
 boned taken or secured
s blue pigeon flying the practice stealing lead from
houses churches or other buildings a species 
depredation very prevalent in london and its vicinity and
which is but too much encouraged by the readiness with which
it can be disposed to the plumbers in general
 blunt a flash term for money
 doffing his jacket taking off his jacket
 mill your mug to muffin dust the peculiarity the irish
character for overstrained metaphor may perhaps in some
degree account for the hibernian's idea beating his head
to flour though he was afterwards inclined to commence his
operations in the true style and character the prize
ring where
men shake hands before they box then give each other
plaguy knocks with all the love and kindness a brother
 tip us your manley give me your hand honour is so sacred
a thing with the irish that the rapid transition from a
violent expression to the point honour is no uncommon
thing amongst them and in this instance it is quite clear
that although he meant to mill the mug his opponent to
muffin dust he had a notion the thing and intended to
do it in an honourable way
during this conversation the spectators who were numerous were
employed in endeavouring to pacify the indignant hibernian who by this
time had buffet it or in other words peeled in prime twig fora
regular turn to all was noise and confusion when a new group
 persons entered the room another capture had been made and another
charge given it was however with some difficulty that honest pat murphy
was prevailed upon to remain a little quiet while one the officers
beckoned dashall out the room and gave him to understand that the
man in custody just brought in was a wellknown pal the one
first suspected though they took not the least notice each other
upon meeting in the mean time another officer in the room had been
searching the person the last captured from whose bosom he drew the
identical handkerchief bob and the irishman recollected seeing him
in the crowd opposite the opera house
this cleared up the mystery in some degree though the two culprits
affected a total ignorance each otho what i said
to the blind man then go and look for him old chap says
i ha ha ha that's your sort my boy keep it up keep
it up d me that's the worst it i always turn
sick when i think a parson i always do and my brother
he is a parson too and he hates to hear any body swear so
you know i always swear like a trooper when i am near him
on purpose to roast him i went to dine with him one day
last week and there was my sisters and two or three more
 what you call your modest women but i sent em all from
the table and then laugh'd at em for i loves fun and
that was fun alive and so there was nobody in the room
but my brother and me and i begun to swear most sweetly i
never swore so well in all my life i swore all my new
oaths it would have done you good to have heard me swear
till at last my brother looked frightened and d me that
was good fun at last he lifted up his hands and eyes to
heaven and calls out o tempore o mores but i was not to
be done so oh oh brother says i what you think to
frighten me by calling all your family about you but i
don't care for you nor your family neither so stow it
i'll mill the whole troop only bring your tempore and mores
here that's all let us have fair play i'll tip em the
gas in a flash lightning i'll box em for five pounds
d me here where's tempore and mores where are they
my eyes how he did stare when he see me ready for a set to
i never laugh'd so in my life he made but two steps out 
the room and left me master the field what d'ye
think that for a lark eh keep it up keep it up d
me says i so i sets down to the table drank as much as i
could then i mix'd the heeltaps all in one bottle and
broke all the empty ones then bid adieu to tempore and
mores and rolled home in a hackneycoach in prime and
plummy order d me
coming along piccadilly last night after leaving you i was overtaken
at the corner rupertstreet by our old collegecompanion harry
farewell pursuing his way to the hummums where it seems he has taken
up his abode harry you remember never was exactly one us he
studies too much and pores everlastingly over musty old volumes 
law cases blackstone's commentaries and other black books to qualify
himself for the black art and as fit and proper person to appear at
the bar the length time that had elapsed since our last meeting was
sufficient inducement for us to crack a bottle together so taking
his arm we proceeded to the place destination where we sat talking
over past times and indulging our humour till halfpast one o'clock
when i sallied forth on my return to long's having altogether abandoned
my original intention calling in goldensquare at the corner 
leicestersquare my ears were assailed with a little the night
music the rattles were in full chorus and the charleys in prime
twig were mustering from all quarters
illustration pages tom and bob catching a charley napping
the street was all alive and i made my way through the crowd to the
immediate scene action which was rendered peculiarly interesting by
the discovery a dainty bit female beauty shewing fight with half
a dozen watchmen in order to extricate herself from the grasp these
guardians our peace she was evidently under the influence 
the bacchanalian god which invigorated her arm without imparting
discretion to her head and she laid about her with such dexterity that
the old files were fearful losing their prey but the odds were
fearfully against her and never did i feel my indignation more aroused
than when i beheld a sturdy ruffian aim a desperate blow at her head
with his rattle which in all probability had it taken the intended
effect would have sent her in search that peace in the other world
 which she was experiencing so little in this it was not possible
for me to stand by an idle spectator the destruction a female
who appeared to have no defender whatever might be the nature the
offence alleged or committed i therefore warded off the blow with my
left arm and with my right gave him a wellplanted blow on the conk
which sent him piping into the kennel in a moment i was surrounded and
charged with a violent assault upon the charley and interfering with
the guardians the night in the execution their duty a complete
diversion took place from the original object their fury and in the
bustle to secure me the unfortunate girl made her escape where to or
how heaven

only knows upon finding this i made no resistance but marched
boldly along with the scouts to st martin's watchhouse where we
arrived just as a hackney coach drew up to the door
take her in d n her eyes she shall stump up the rubbish 
before i leave her or give me the address her flash covey 
and so here goes by this time we had entered the watchhouse where
i perceived the awful representative justice seated in an arm chair
with a good blazing fire smoking his pipe in consequential ease
a crowd charleys with broken lanterns broken heads and other
symptoms a row together with several casual spectators had gained
admittance when jarvis entered declaring by g he wouldn't be
choused by any wh re or cull in christendom and he would make em
come down pretty handsomely or he'd know the reason why and so please
your worship sir then turning round hallo said he sam what's
become that there woman eh what you've been playing booty eh and
let her escape the man to whom this was intended to be addressed did
not appear to be present as no reply was made however the case was
briefly explained
but by g i won't put any thing in sam's vay again cried
jarvey for my own part as i knew nothing the occurrences
adverted to i was as much in the dark as if i had gone home without
interruption the representations the charleys proved decisive
against me in vain i urged the cause humanity and the necessity
i felt protecting a defenceless female from the violence 
accumulating numbers and that i had done no more than every man ought
to have done upon such an occasion old puff and swill the lord
 the night declared that i must have acted with malice
aforethought that i was a pal in the concern and that i had been
instrumental in the design effecting a rescue and after a very
short deliberation he concluded that i must be a notorious rascal and
desired me to make up my mind to remain with him for the remainder 
the night not relishing this i proposed to send for bail assuring him

find money

attendance in the morning but was informed it could not be
accepted as it was clearly made out against me that i had committed
a violent breach the peace and nothing at that time could be
produced that would prove satisfactory under these circumstances and
partly induced by a desire to avoid being troublesome in other quarters
i submitted to a restraint which it appeared i could not very well
avoid and taking my seat in an armchair by the fireside i soon fell
fast asleep from which i was only aroused by the occasional entrances
and exits the guardians until between four and five o'clock when
a sort general muster the charleys took place and each one
depositing his nightly paraphernalia proceeded to his own habitation
finding the liberation others from their duties would not have the
effect emancipating me from my confinement which was likely to
be prolonged to eleven or perhaps twelve o'clock i began to feel
my situation as a truly uncomfortable one when i was informed by the
watchhouse keeper who resides upon the spot that he was going to
turn in that there was fire enough to last till his wife turn'd
out which would be about six o'clock and as i had the appearance a
gentleman if there was any thing i wanted she would endeavour to make
herself useful in obtaining it but lord said he there is no such
thing as believing any body nowadays there was such sets out and
such manoeuvring that nobody knew nothing nobody
i am obliged to you my friend said i for this piece 
information and in order that you may understand something the
person you are speaking to beyond the mere exterior view here is
halfacrown for your communication
why sir said he laying on at the same moment a shovel coals
this here makes out what i said don't you see said i that are
gentleman is a gentleman every inch him says i as don't want
nothing at all no more nor what is right and if so be as how he's got
himself in a bit a hobble i knows very well as how he's got
the tip in his pocket and doesn't want for spirit to pull it
out perhaps you might like some breakfast sir
 turn in going to bed this is a term most in use among
seafaring men
 tip is synonymous with blunt and means money
why yes said i for i began to feel a little inclined that way
o my wife sir said he will do all you want when she rouses
herself
i suppose continued i you frequently have occasion to accommodate
persons in similar situations
lord bless you yes sir and a strange set rum customers we have
too sometimes why it was but a few nights ago we had em stowed here
as thick as three in a bed we had em all upon the hop you never
see'd such fun in all your life and this here place was as full 
curiosities as peacock's at exeter change or barleyfair show em up
here all alive alive o
indeed said i feeling a little inquisitive on the subject and how
did this happen
why it was a romish piece business altogether there was a large
party dancing fashionables all met together for a little jig in st
martin's lane and a very pretty medley there was them the fiddlers
wagged their elbows and the lads and lasses their trotters till about
one o'clock when just as they were in the midst a quadrille in
burst the officers and quickly changed the tune the appearance 
these gentlemen had an instantaneous effect upon all parties present
the cause their visit was explained and the whole squad taken into
custody to give an account themselves and was brought here in
hackneycoaches the delicate miss and her assiduous partner who a
short time before had been all spirits and animation were now sunk in
gloomy reflections upon the awkwardness their situation and many 
our inhabitants would have fainted when they were informed they would
have to appear before the magistrate in the morning but for the
welltimed introduction a little drap the cratur which an irish
lady axed me to fetch for her but the best the fun was that in the
group we had a lord and a parson for the dignity the one and the
honour the other they were admitted to bail lord have mercy upon
us said the parson amen said the lord and this had the desired
effect upon the constable the night for he let them off on the sly
you understand but my eyes what work there was in the morning sixteen
harvey full live lumber
 hop a dance
were taken to bowstreet in a nice pickle you may be sure
dancingpumps and silkstockings after setting in the watchhouse all
night and surrounded by lots people that hooted and howled as the
procession passed along in good style they were safely landed at the
brown bear from which they were handed over in groups to be examined
by the magistrate when the men were discharged upon giving satisfactory
accounts and the women after some questions being put to them you see
all this took place because they were dancing in an unlicensed room it
was altogether a laughable setout as ever you see'd the dandy and
the dandyzettes the exquisite the shorten the ladies maid and the
prentice boys my lord and his reverence mingled up higgledypiggledy
pigs in the straw with bowstreet officers runners and
watchmen ladies squalling and fainting men swearing and almost
fighting it would have been a pleasure to have kick'd up a row that
night a purpose to get admission you would have been highly amused
i'll assure you good morning sir and thus saying he turned the lock
upon me and left me to my meditations in about a couple hours
the old woman made her appearance and prepared me some coffee and at
eleven o'clock came the constable the night to accompany me before
the magistrate
aware that the circumstances were rather against me and that i had no
right to interfere in other persons business or quarrels i consulted
him upon the best mode making up the matter for although i had
really done no more than becomes a man in protecting a female i had
certainly infringed upon the law in effecting the escape a person in
custody and consequently was liable to the penalty or penalties in such
cases made and provided on our arrival at the brown bear i was met
by a genteellooking man who delivered me a letter and immediately
disappeared upon breaking the seal i found its contents as follows
dear sir although unknown to me i have learned enough your
character to pronounce you a trump a prime cock and nothing but a good
one i am detained by john doe and richard roe with their d d fieri
facias or i should be with you however i trust you will excuse the
liberty i take in requesting you will make use the enclosed for the
purpose shaking yourself out the hands the scouts and
their pals we shall have some opportunities meeting when i will
explain in the mean time believe me i am
your's truly
tom
with this advice so consonant with my own opinion i immediately
complied and having satisfied the brokenheaded charley and paid all
expences incurred i was induced to walk into the office merely to give
a look around me when by a lucky chance i saw you enter and thus you
have a full true and particular account the peregrinations your
humble servant
listening with close attention to this narrative sparkle's all other
subjects had escaped observation till they found themselves in the
strand
whither are we bound inquired sparkle
on a voyage discoveries replied dashall and we just wanted you
to act as pilot
what place is this inquired bob
that continued sparkle is somersethouse it is a fine old
building it stands on the banks the thames raised on piers and
arches and is now appropriated to various public offices and houses
belonging to the various offices the government
the terrace which lies on the river is very fine and may be well
viewed from waterloo bridge the front in the strand you perceive
has a noble aspect being composed a rustic basement supporting a
corinthian order columns crowned with an attic in the centre and at
the extremities with a balustrade the south front which looks into the
court is very elegant in its composition
the basement consists nine large arches and three in the centre
open forming the principal entrance and three at each filled with
windows the doric order are adorned with pilasters entablatures
and pediments on the keystones the nine arches are carved in alto
relievo nine colossal masks representing the ocean and the eight main
rivers england viz thames humber mersey dee medway tweed
tyne and severn with appropriate emblems to denote their various
characters
over the basement the corinthian order consists ten columns upon
pedestals having their regular entablature it comprehends two
floors and the attic in the centre the front extends over three
intercolomniations and is divided into three parts by four colossal
statues placed on the columns the order it terminates with a
group consisting the arms the british empire supported on one
side by the genius england and by fame sounding the trumpet on the
other these three open arches in the front form the principal entrance
to the whole the structure and lead to an elegant vestibule
decorated with doric columns
the terrace which fronts the thames is spacious and commands a
beautiful view part the river including blacksmiths waterloo
and westminster bridges it is reared on a grand rustic basement
having thirtytwo spacious arches the arcade thus formed is judiciously
relieved by projections ornamented with rusticated columns and the
effect the whole the terrace from the water is truly grand and
noble there is however at present no admission for the public toit
but in all probability it will be open to all when the edifice is
completed which would form one the finest promenades in the world
and prove to be one the first luxuries the metropolis
that statue in the centre is a representation our late king george
the third with the thames at his feet pouring wealth and plenty from
a large cornucopia it is executed by bacon and has his characteristic
cast expression it is in a most ludicrous situation being placed
behind and on the brink a deep area
in the vestibule are the rooms the royal society the society 
antiquarians and the royal academy arts all in a very grand and
beautiful style over the door the royal academy is a bust michael
angelo and over the door leading to the royal society and society 
antiquarians you will find the bust sir isaac newton
the governmentoffices to which this building is devoted are objects
 great astonishment to strangers being at once commodious and
elegant and worthy the wealth the nation to which they belong the
hall the navy office is a fine room with two fronts one facing the
terrace and river and the other facing the court on the right is the
stampoffice it consists a multitude apartments the room in
which the stamping is executed is very interesting to the curious on
the left you see the payoffice the navy
the principal thing to attract notice in this edifice is the
solidity and completeness the workmanship in the masonry and indeed
in every other part
after taking a rather prolonged view this elegant edifice they again
sallied forth into the strand mingling with all the noise and bustle
 a crowded street where by turns were to be discovered rustling each
other parsons lawyers apothecaries projectors excisemen organists
picturesellers bear and monkeyleaders fiddlers and bailiffs the
barber and the chimneysweeper were however always observed to be
careful in avoiding the touch each other as if contamination must bethe
inevitable consequence
my dear fellow exclaimed a tall and welldressed person who dragged
the honourable tom dashall on one side you are the very person i
wanted i'm very glad to see you in town again but i have not a moment
to spare the bloodhounds are in pursuit this term will be ended
in two days then comes the long vacation liberty without hiring
a horse you understand was devilishly afraid being nabb'd just
now should have been dished if i had lend me five shillings come
make haste
five shillings diddler when am i to be paid you remember when i
grow rich was the reply
know yes i know all about it but no matter i'm not going to settle
accounts just now so don't detain me i hate debtor and creditor
fine sport tomorrow eh shall be at the ring in cog take no
notice disguised as a quaker obadiah lankloaks d d large beaver
hat and hide my physog lend me what silver you have and be quick
about it for i can't stay thank you you're a d a good fellow
tom a trump shall now pop into a hack and drive into another
county thank ye good day by by
during this harangue while tost was counting his silver the ingenious
mr diddler seized all he had and whipping it speedily into his pocket
in a few minutes was out his sight
sparkle observing dashall looking earnestly after diddler approached
and giving him a lusty slap on the shoulder ha ha ha exclaimed he
what are you done again
i suppose so said dashall confound the fellow he is always
borrowing i never met him in my life but he had some immediate
necessity or other to require a loan a little temporary supply as he
calls it
i wonder said sparkle that you are so ready to lend after such
frequent experience how much does he owe you
heaven only knows continued tom for i do not keep account against
him i must even trust to his honour so it is useless to stand here
losing our time come let us forward
with all my heart said sparkle and with permission i propose a
visit to the bonassus a peep at st paul's and a chop at dolly's
this proposition being highly approved they continued their
walk along the strand towards temple bar and in a few minutes were
attracted by the appearance men dressed in the garb the yeomen 
the guards who appeared active in the distribution handbills and
surrounded a house on the front which appeared a long string high
and distinguished names as patrons and patronesses the celebrated
animal called the bonassus crossing the road in their approach to
the door tallyhoho could not help admiring the simple elegance a
shopfront belonging to a grocer whose name is peck
very handsome and tasty indeed replied sparkle that combination 
marble and brass has a light and elegant effect it has no appearance 
being laboured at the inhabitant the house i believe is a foreigner
i think an italian but london boasts some the most elegant shops
in the world and by this time they entered the opposite house
chapter 
in london my life is a ring delight
in frolics i keep up the day and the night
i snooze at the hummums till twelve perhaps later
i rattle the bell and i roar up the waiter
your honour says he and he makes me a leg
he brings me my tea but i swallow an egg
for tea in a morning's a slop i renounce
so i down with a glass good right cherrybounce
with swearing tearing ranting jaunting slashing
smashing smacking cracking rumbling tumbling
laughing quaffing smoking joking swaggering
staggering
so thoughtless so knowing so green and so mellow
this this is the life a frolicsome fellow
upon entering the house and depositing their shilling each to
view this newly discovered animal from the appalachian mountains 
america and being supplied with immense long bills descriptive his
form and powers come along said sparkle let us have a look at the
most wonderful production nature only seventeen months old five
feet ten inches high and one the most fashionable fellows in the
metropolis
it should seem so said tallyhoho by the long list friends and
visitors that are detailed in the commencement the bill fare
perhaps said tom there are more bon asses than one
very likely continued sparkle but let me tell you the allusion in
this case does not apply for this animal has nothing the donkey
about him and makes no noise as you will infer from the following
lines in the bill
as the bonassus does not roar
his fame is widely known
for no dumb animal before
has made such noise in town
at this moment the barking a dog assailed their ears and
suspended the conversation passing onward to the den the bonassus
they found a darkfeatured gentleman middling stature with his hair
whiskers and ears so whitened with powder as to form a complete
contrast with his complexion and a black silk handkerchief which he wore
round his neck holding a large browncoloured dog by the collar in
order to prevent annoyance to the visitors
d n the dog exclaimed he although he is the best tempered
creature in the world he don't seem to like the appearance the
bonassus and espying sparkle ha my dear fellow how are you i
have not seen you for a long while
why sir d n ll i am happy to say i never was better in my
life allow me to introduce you to my two friends the hon mr dashall
and robert tallyhoho sir d n ll harlequin
the mutual accompaniments such an introduction having passed among
them the knight who was upon the moment departure as they entered
expressed his approbation the animal he had been viewing and
lugging his puppy by one hand and his cudgel in the other wished them
a good morning
there is an eccentric man title continued sparkle
i should judge said bob there was a considerable portion 
eccentricity about him by his appearance is he a baronet
a baronet replied sparkle no no he is no other than a quack
doctor 
 all the subjects that afford opportunities for the
satiric pen in the metropolis perhaps there is none more
abundant or prolific than that quackery dr johnson
observes that cheats can seldom stand long against
laughter but if a judgment is really to be formed from
existing facts it may be supposed that times are so
materially changed since the residence that able writer
in this sublunary sphere that the reverse the position
may with greater propriety be asserted for such is the
prevailing practice the present day that according to
the opinion thousands there is nothing to be done
without a vast deal more profession and pretence than
actual power and he who is the best able to bear laughing
at is the most likely to realize the hopes he entertains 
obtaining celebrity and having his labours crowned with
success nothing can be more evident than this in the
medical profession though there are successful quacks 
all kinds and in all situations to be found in london
this may truly be called the age quackery from the
abundance impostors every kind that prey upon society
and such as cannot or will not think for themselves ought
to be guarded in a publication this nature against the
fraudulent acts those persons who make it their business
and profit to deteriorate the health morals and amusements
 the public but in the present instance we are speaking
 the medical quack only than which perhaps there is none
more remarkable
the race bosses brodrums solomon perkins claimants
c is filled by others equal notoriety and no doubt 
equal utility the cerfs the curries the laments the
ruspinis the coopers and monroe are all equally entitled
to public approbation particularly if we may credit the
letters from the various persons who authenticate the
miraculous cures they have performed in the most inveterate
we hail almost said the most impossible cases if those
persons are really in existence and who can doubt it they
certainly have occasion to be thankful for their escapes
and we congratulate them for in our estimation quack
doctors seem to consider the human frame merely as a subject
for experiments which if successful will secure the
reputation the practitioner the acquisition fame and
fortune is in the estimation these philosophers cheaply
purchased by sacrificing the lives a few the vulgar
to whom they prescribe gratis and the slavish obedience 
some patients to the doctor is really astonishing it is
said that a convalescent at bath wrote to his physician in
london to know whether he might eat sauce with his pork
but we have not been able to discover whether he expected an
answer gratis that would perhaps have been an experiment
not altogether grateful to the doctor's feelings
the practice advertising and billing the town has become
so common that a man scarcely opens a coalshed or a
potatoesstall without giving due notice it in the
newspapers and distributing handbills and frequently with
great success but our doctors who make no show their
commodities have no mode making themselves known without
it hence the quantity bills thrust into the hand the
passenger through the streets london which divulge the
almost incredible performances their publishers a highsounding
name such as the chevalier de diamant the
chevalier de rushing or the medical board well bored behind
and before are perhaps more necessary with a few paper
puffs as palpable hits my lord than either skill or
practice to obtain notice and secure fame
the chevalier de claimant who was originally a boxmaker
and a man genius considering boxmaking a plebeian
occupation was for deducing a logical position not exactly
perhaps by fair argument but at all events through the
teeth and was determined although he could not like dr
n mend the apology his friends at least to give
them an opportunity for plenty jawwork with this
laudable object in view he obtained a patent for making
artificial teeth mineral paste and in his advertisements
condescended not to prove their utility as substitutes for
the real teeth when decayed or wanting this was beneath
his notice and would have been a piece mere plebeian
quackery unworthy his great genius but absolutely
assured the world that his mineral teeth were infinitely
superior to any production nature both for mastication
and beauty how this was relished we know not but he
declared and he certainly ought to know that none but
silly and timid persons would hesitate for one moment to
have their teeth drawn and substitute his minerals and it
is wonderful to relate that although his charges were
enormous and the operation as may be supposed not the
most pleasant yet people could not resist the ingenious
chevalier's fascinating and drawing puffs in consequence 
which he soon became possessed a large surplus 
capital with which he determined to speculate in the funds
for this purpose he employed old tom bish the stockbroker
to purchase stock for the amount but owing to a sudden
fluctuation in the market a considerable depreciation took
place between the time purchase and that payment a
circumstance which made the chevalier grin and show his
teeth determining however not to become a victim to the
fangs bulls and bears but rather to dive like a duck he
declared the bargain was not legal and that he would not be
bound by it bish upon this occasion proved a hardmouthed
customer to the man teeth and was not a quiet subject to
be drawn but brought an action against the mineral monger
and recovered the debt tom's counsel in stating the case
observed that the defendant would find the law could bite
sharper aud hold tighter than any teeth he could make and
so it turned out
the chevalier de r sp ni is another character who has cut
no small figure in this line but has recently made his
appearance in the gazette not exactly on so happy an
occasion as such a circumstance would be to his brother
chip dr d n ll now we suppose sir francis though
perhaps equally entitled to the honour knighthood the
chevalier has for some years looked royalty in the face by
residing opposite carlton house and taken every precaution
to let the public know that such an important public
character was there to be found by displaying his name as
conspicuously as possible on brass plates c so that the
visitors to carlton house could hardly fail to notice him as
the second greatest character that great neighbourhood
but what could induce so great a man to sport his figure in
the gazette is as unaccountable as the means by which he
obtained such happy celebrity had it occurred immediately
after the war it might have been concluded without much
stretch imagination that the chevalier who prides
himself on his intimacy with all the great men the day
had through the friendship the duke wellington made
a contract for the teeth and jawbones all who fell at
the battle waterloo and that by bringing to market so
great a stock at one time the article had fallen in value
and left the speculating chevalier so great a loser as to
cause his bankruptcy whether such is the real cause or not
it is difficult to ascertain what could induce the chevalier
to descend from his dealings with the head to dabble with
lower commodities
among other modes obtaining notoriety usually resorted
to by empiric the chevalier used to job a very genteel
carriage and pair but his management was so excellent that
the expenses his equipage were very trifling for as it
was not intended to run but merely to stand at the door
like a barker at a broker's shop or a directionpost he
had the loan on very moderate terms the jobmaster taking
into account that the wind the cattle was not likely to
be injured or the wheels rattled to pieces by velocity or
smashed by any violent concussion
the chevalier had a son who unfortunately was not endowed
by nature with so much ambition or information as his
father for frequently when the carriage has been standing
at the door he has been seen drinking gin most cordially
with coaches without once thinking the evils example
or recollecting that he was one the family papa used to
be very angry on these occasions because as he said it
was letting people know that coaches was only hired as job
and not as a family domestic
for the great benefit and advantage the community
medical boards have recently been announced in various parts
 the metropolis where according to the assertions the
principals in their advertisements every disease incident
to human nature is treated by men skilful practice and
among these truly useful establishments those drs
cooper munro and co charlotte house blacksmiths and
woodstockhouse oxfordroad are not the least conspicuous
who these worthies are it is perhaps difficult to
ascertain one thing however is certain that sir
f s c e d n ll med is announced as treasurer
therefore there can be no doubt but that all is fair aboveboard
for
brutus is an honourable man
so are they all all honourable men
and where so much skill derived from experience is
exercised it cannot be doubted but great and important
benefits may result to a liberal and enlightened people 
the establishment itself we are informed by a friend that
having occasion to call on the treasurer upon some
business the door was opened by a coppercoloured servant
a goodlooking young indian not a fuscus hydaspes but a
serving man good appearance who ushered him up stairs
and introduced him to the front room on the first floor
where all was quackery bronze and brass an electrical
machine images pictures and diplomas framed and glazed
and a table covered with books and papers in a short time
a person very imposing appearance entered the room with
his hair profusely powdered and his person from his chin
to his toes enveloped in a sort plaid roquelaure who
apologizing for the absence the doctor began to assure
him his being in the entire confidence the board and
in all probability would have proceeded to the operation 
feeling the pulse in a very short time had not the visitor
discovered in the features this disciple aesculapius a
person he had known in former times why good god
cried he is that you what have you done with the magiclantern
and the lecture on heads am i right or am i in
fairyland calling him by his name it was in vain to
hesitate it was impossible to escape the discovery was
complete it was plain however that the dealer in magical
delusions had not altogether given up the art 
legerdemain which perhaps he finds the most profitable 
the two
 the worthy knight himself and perhaps the coopers and
munro have been consumed by the electrical fluid their
own board much might be said he is the inventor a lifepreserver
with which it may be fairly presumed he has
effected valuable services to his country by the
preservation royalty as a proof deserving the honour
he has obtained he is patriotic and independent masonic
and benevolent a great admirer fancy horses and fancy
ladies a curer incurables and has recently published
one the most extraordinary memoirs that has ever been
laid before the public embellished with two portraits
which the two is most interesting must be left to the
discrimination those who view them it must however be
acknowledged that after reading the following extract
ingratitude is not yet eradicated from our nature since
notwithstanding he has obtained the dignified appellation 
sir francis the gazette says that in future no improper
person shall be admitted to the honour knighthood inconsequence
 two surreptitious presentations lately the
one an med the other frc surgeons particularly if it
were possible that this gentleman may be one the persons
alluded to for what says the memoir
the utility sir francis's invention being thus fully
established and its ingenuity universally admired it
excited the interest the first characters among the
nobility and an introduction to court was repeatedly
offered to sir francis on this account after a previous
communication with one the royal family and also with
the secretary state on the th june last he had the
honour being presented to his majesty who justly
appreciating the merit the discovery was pleased to
confer upon him the honour knighthood
thus it is pleasing in the distribution honours by the
hand the sovereign to mark where they are conferred on
real merit this is the true intention their origin but
it has been too often departed from and they have been
given where no other title existed than being the friend 
those who had influence to gain the royal ear from the
above statement it will be seen this honour was conferred
on sir francis by his majesty for an invention which has
saved since its discovery the lives many hundreds and
which may be considered as having given the original idea to
the similar inventions that have been attempted since that
time its utility and importance we have also seen
acknowledged and rewarded by the two leading societies in
this country and perhaps in europe viz the royal humane
and the society arts the sovereign therefore was only
recognizing merit which had been previously established and
the honour knighthood to the credit the individual
was conferred by his majesty in the most liberal and
handsome manner without any other influence being used by
sir francis than simply preferring the claim
thus the subject knighthood is to be nursed and as the
doctor and the nurse are generally to be recognized
together no one can read this part the memoir without
exclaiming well done nussey but why not gazetted after
this liberal and handsome manner being rewarded or why
an allusion to two surreptitious presentations the names 
which two persons so pointedly omitted cannot well be
misunderstood this is but doing things by halves though no
such an observation can be applied to the proceedings 
charlottehouse where cooper munro and co being well
explained means two or three persons viz a black a white
man and a mahoganycoloured knight a barber by trade and
a skinner by company a dealer in mercurial a puff by
practice and an advertiser well versed in all the arts 
his prototype a practitioner in panegyric the puff direct
the puff preliminary the puff collateral the puff
collusive and the puff oblique or puff by implication
whether this will apply to sir charles this or not is
perhaps not so easy to ascertain but as birds a feather
like to flock together so these medical knights in
misfortune deserve to be noticed in the same column
although the one is said to be a shaver and the other a
quaker it seems they have both been moved by the same
spirit and both follow a good way off the profession 
medicine
among the various improvements these improving times for
we are still improving notwithstanding complaint a learned
little devil inflated with gas has suggested a plan for
the establishment a medical assuranceoffice where
person and property might be insured at so much per annum
and the advantages to be derived from such an institution
would be that instead the insurance increasing with
years it would grow less and less how many thousand
grateful patients would it relieve annually but we fear it
would be a daily source sorrow to these knightly
medical and would by them be considered a devilish hard
case
but hush here is other company and i will give you an account him
as we go along
they now attended the keeper who explained the age height weight
species size power and propensities the animal and then departed
on their road towards temple bar on passing through which they were
overtaken again by sir francis in a gig drawn by a duncoloured
horse with his puppy between his legs and a servant by his side and
immediately renewed the previous conversation
there he goes again said sparkle and a rare fellow he is too
i should think so said bob he must have quacked to some good
purpose to obtain the honour knighthood
not positively that continued sparkle for to obtain and to
deserve are not synonymous and if report say true there is not much
honour attached to his obtaining it
in the modesty fearful duty
i read as much as from the rattling tongue
 saucy and audacious eloquence
love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
at least speak most to my capacity
and according to my humble conception he who talks much about himself
or pays others to talk or write about him is generally most likely to
be least deserving public patronage for if a man possesses real and
evident abilities in any line profession the public will not belong
in making a discovery its existence and the bounty as is most
usually the case would quickly follow upon the heels approbation
but many a meritorious man in the metropolis is pining away his
miserable existence too proud to beg and too honest to steal while
others with scarcely more brains than a sparrow by persevering ina
determination to leave no stone unturned to make themselves appear
ridiculous as a first step to popularity and having once excited
attention even though it is merely to be laughed at by the thinking
part mankind he finds it no great difficulty to draw the money out
 their pockets while their eyes are riveted on a contemplation his
person or conduct and there are not wanting instances effrontery
that have elevated men little or no capacity to dignified situations
if report say true the present secretary the admiralty who is
admirable for his poetry also was originally a hairdresser residing
somewhere in blackfriar's or westminsterroad but then you must
recollect he was a man who knew it was useless to lose a single
opportunity and probably such has been the case with sir daniel
harlequin who from keeping a small shop in tapping making a blaze
upon the water about his lifepreserver marrying a wife with a red
face and a full pocket retired to a small cottage at mile and
afterwards establishing a medical board has got himself dubbed a
knight to be sure he has had a deal puffing and blowing work to get
through in his progress which probably accounts for his black looks
not a little increased by the quantity powder he wears but what have
we here finding the bustle the streets considerably increased after
passing temple bar
some political bookseller or other in all probability said
tom i'll step forward and see and in passing through the numerous
body persons that crowded on every side the whole party was
separated bob who had hung a little back while his two friends rushed
forward was lingering near the corner the temple he was beckoned by
a man across the way to whom he immediately went
do you happen to want a piece fine india silk handkerchiefs sir
i have some in my pocket that i can recommend and sell cheap for money
must be had but only keep it to yourself because they are smuggled
goods the best quality and richest pattern during this opening
speech he was endeavouring to draw tallyhoho under the archway 
bellyard when sparkle espying him ran across to him and taking him
by the arm come along said he and if you don't take yourself off
instantly i'll put you in custody shaking his stick at the other
all this was like hebrew to bob who for his part really conceived the
poor fellow as he termed him might be in want money and compelled
to dispose his article for subsistence
ha ha ha cried sparkle i see you know nothing about them these
are the locusts the town at this moment they were joined by the
hon tom dashall
egad continued sparkle i just saved your cousin from being
trepanned and sent for a soldier
tallyhoho appeared all amazement
what cried tom in the wars venus then i suppose i know he has a
fancy for astronomy and probably he was desirous taking a peep into
shirelane where he might easily find the sun moon and seven stars
ha ha ha replied sparkle not exactly so but i rescued him from
the hands a buffer who would
 buffers miscalled duffers persons who adopt a species 
swindling which is rather difficult detection though it
is daily practised in london the term buffer takes its
derivation from a custom which at one time prevailed 
carrying bandanas garnets french stockings and silk 
various kinds next the shirts the sellers so that upon
making a sale they were obliged to undress in order to come
at the goods or in other words to strip to the skin or
buff it by which means they obtained the title buffers
this trade if it may be so termed is carried on in a
genteel manner the parties go about from house to house
and attend publichouses inns and fairs pretending to
sell smuggled goods such as those already mentioned and by
offering their goods for sale they are enabled by practice
to discover the proper objects for their arts
buffers or duffers who are not rogues in the strict sense
 the word only offer to sell their goods to the best
advantage and by this means evade the detection the
police but are equally subversive or destructive common
honesty under a cloak or disguise for if they can persuade
any person that the article offered is actually better or
cheaper than any other person's they are doing no more than
every tradesman does but then as they pay no rent or taxes
to the state the principal objection to them lies in the
mode operation and an overstrained recommendation 
their goods which are always according to their account
 the most superior quality and they have a peculiar
facility discovering the novice or the silly to whom
walking up with a serious countenance and interesting air
they broach the pleasing intelligence that they have on
sale an excellent article well worth their attention giving
a caution at the same time that honour and secrecy must be
implicitly observed or it may lead to unpleasantness to
both parties by these means persons from the country are
frequently enticed into publichouses to look at their
goods and if they do not succeed in one way they are
almost sure in another by having an accomplice who will
not fail to praise the articles for sale and propose some
gambling scheme by which the party is plundered his
money by passing forged banknotes base silver or copper
in the course their dealings
doubtless have fleeced him in good style if he could only have
induced him to attend to his story
the mob you see collected there said the hon tom dashalll is
attracted by two circumstances money's new coronation crop just
launched and a broken image a highlander at the door a
snuffshop each them truly important and interesting course the
elevation one man and the destruction another the poor scotchman
seems dreadfully bruised and i suppose is now under the doctor's hands
for he has two or three plasters on his face
yes continued sparkle he has been out on a spree had a bit a
turnup and been knock'd down
upon hearing this conversation tallyhoho could not help inquiring into
the particulars
why the facts are simply as follows continued
 spree a bit fun or a frolicsome lark
sparkle in london as you perceive tradesmen are in the habit
 exhibiting signs the business or profession in which they are
engaged the pawnbroker decorates his door with three gold balls the
barber in some places though it is a practice almost out date
hangs out a long pole the goldbeater an arm with a hammer in the
act striking the chemist a head glauber or aesculapius the
tobacconist a roll tobacco and late it has become customary
for these venders pulverised atoms called snuff to station a wooden
figure a highlander in the act taking a pinch hardham's or
highdried as a sort inviting introduction to their counters and
a few nights back a scotchman returning from his enjoyments at a
neighbouring tavern stopped to have a little friendly chat with this
gentleman's highlander and by some means or other i suppose a quarrel
ensued upon which the animated young scotchman took advantage his
countryman floored him broke both his arms and otherwise did him
considerable bodily injury the effects which are still visible
and johnny bull who is fond a little gapeseed is endeavouring to
console him under his sufferings
very kind him indeed replied bob
at any rate said tom the tobacconist will have occasion to be
grateful to the highlanders for some portion his popularity
 it is matter astonishment to some but not less true
that many tradesmen in the metropolis have to ascribe both
fame and fortune to adventitious circumstances it is said
that hardham fleet street had to thank the celebrated
comedian foote who in one his popular characters
introducing his snuffbox offered a pinch to the person he
was in conversation with on the stage who spoke well it
and inquired where he obtained it why at hardham's to
be sure and to this apparently trifling circumstance
hardham was indebted for his fortune
the importance a highlander to a snuffshop will appear
by a perusal the following fact
a very respectable young man a clerk in the office an
eminent solicitor was recently brought before mr alderman
atkins upon the charge being disorderly the prisoner
it seemed on his return home from a social party where he
had been sacrificing rather too freely to the jolly god was
struck with the appearance a showy wooden figure a
highlander at the door mr micklan's snuffshop no 
fleet street the young attorney who is himself a
scotchman must needs claim acquaintance with his
countryman he chucked him familiarly under the chin called
him a very pretty fellow and in the vehemence his
affection embraced him with so much violence as to force
him from his station mr micklan ran to the assistance 
his servant and in the scuffle the unfortunate highlander
had both his arms dislocated the frill that adorned his
neck damaged besides other personal injuries which his
living countryman not being in the humour to atone for mr
mickle gave him in charge to the watchman before the
magistrate in the morning the young man appeared heartily
sick his folly and perfectly willing to make every
reparation but complained the excessive demand which he
stated to be no less than thirteen guineas mr micklan
produced the remains the unfortunate highlander who
excited a compound fracture both arms with a mutilation
 three or four fingers and such other bodily wounds as
to render his perfect recovery so as to resume his
functions at mr micklan's door altogether hopeless the
highlander the complainant stated cost him thirteen
guineas and was entirely new the sum might seem large for
the young gentleman to pay for such a frolic but it would
not compensate him for the injury he should sustain by the
absence the figure for however strange it might appear
he did not hesitate to say that without it he should not
have more than half his business since he had stationed it
at his door he had taken on an average thirty shillings a
day more than he had done previous to exhibiting his
attractions
there being no proof a breach the peace mr alderman
atkins advised the gentleman to settle the matter upon the
best terms he could they withdrew together and on their
return the echo appears ignorant and
unsuspicious
 lusty drunk
 toddle to toddle is to walk slowly either from
infirmity or choice come let us toddle is a very
familiar phrase signifying let us be going
desirous seeing an to this bit gig come along said
sparkle they'll all be in prime twig presently and we shall have some
fun
i'm the boy for a bit a bobbery
nabbing a lantern or milling a pane
a jolly good lark is not murder or robbery
let us be ready and nimble
hark said he there's a fiddlescraper in the house here goes and
immediately they entered
they had no occasion to repent their movements for in one corner
 the taproom sat billy waters a wellknown character about town
a black man with a wooden leg was fiddling to a slaughterman from
fleetmarket in wooden shoes who deck'd with all the paraphernalia 
his occupation a greasy jacket and nightcap an apron besmeared with
mud blood and grease nearly an inch thick and a leathern girdle
from which was suspended a case to hold his knives and his sleeves
tuck'd up as if he had but just left the slaughterhouse was dancing in
the centre to the infinite amusement the company which consisted 
an old woman with periwinkles and crabs for sale in a basket a porter
with his knot upon the table a fustian with his broadflapped hat and
his bell by his side an irish hodman and two poor girls who appeared
to be greatly taken with the black fiddler whose head was decorated
with an oilskinned cock'd hat and a profusion many coloured
feathers on the other side the room sat a young man 
shabbygenteel appearance reading the newspaper with close attention
and purring forth volumes smoke limping billy and mother mapps were
immediately known and room was made for their accommodation while the
fiddler's elbow and the slaughterman's wooden shoes were kept in motion
max l was the order the day and the sluice in good
request mother mapps was made easy by being informed the streetkeeper
had her valuables in charge which limping billy promised he would
redeem bring us a
 max a very common term for gin
 sluice a ginshop or publichouse so denominated from
the lower orders society sluicing their throats as it
were with gin and probably derived from the old song
entitled the christening little joey formerly sung
by jemmy dodd facetious memory
and when they had sluiced their gobs
with striving to excel wit
the lads began to hang their nobs
and lip their grows the velvets
nobs heads
 grows originally a dutch word meaning wives or girls
velvet the tongue
noggin white tape and fill me a pipe said he d n
my eyes i knowe as how it you'd be all right enough i never gets in
no rows whatever without getting myself out again come ould chap
vet your vistle and tip it us rum go it my kiddy that are's just vat
i likes 
vat's the reason i an't to have a pipe said mother mapps
lord bless your heart said the donkeydriver if i did'nt forget
you never trust me here landlord a pipe for this here lady
which way did the bull run said the irishman
bl st me if i know replied limping billy for i was a
looking out for my own ass let's have the sprig shelalah ould
blackamoor come tune up
the old woman being supplied with a pipe and the fiddler having joined
his nerves with a glass blue ruin to it they went some singing
some whistling and others drumming with their hands upon the table
while tom bob and sparkle taking a seat at the other side 
the room ordered a glass brandy and water each and enjoyed the
merriment the scene before them perhaps more than those actually
engaged in it bob was alive to every movement and every character for
it was new and truly interesting and kept growing more so for in a
few minutes limping billy and mother mapps joined the slaughterman in
the dance when nothing could be more grotesque and amusing their pipes
in their mouths clapping hands and snapping fingers formed a
curious accompaniment to the squeaking the fiddle the broad grin 
the dustman and the preposterous laugh the
 white tape also a common term for gin particularly among
the ladies
 ould chap or ould boy familiar terms address among
flash lads being a sort contraction old acquaintance
or old friend
 blue ruin gin
irishman at the feelers in the centre heightened the picture more
gin more music and more tobacco soon ad a visible effect upon the
party and reeling became unavoidable the young man reading the paper
found it impossible to understand what he was perusing and having
finished his pipe and his pint made his exit appearing to have no
relish for the entertainment and perhaps heartily cursing both the
cause and the effect still however the party was not reduced in
number for as one went out another came in
this new customer was a younglooking man bearing a large board on a
high pole announcing the residence a bugdestroyer in the strand
his appearance was grotesque in the extreme and could only be equalled
by the eccentricities his manners and conversation he was dressed
in a brown coat close buttoned over which he had a red camlet or stuff
stout apparently the offcast some theatrical performer but with
a determination to appear fashionable for
folks might as well be dead nay buried too
as not to dress and act as others do
he wore mustachios a pair green spectacles and his whole figure was
surmounted with a furcap taking a seat directly opposite our party
at the same table bring me a pint said he and then deliberately
searching his pockets he produced a short pipe and some tobacco with
which he filled it you see said he i am obliged to smoke according
to the doctor's orders for an asthma so i always smokes three pipes a
day that's my allowance but i can eat more than any man in the room
and can dance sing and act nothing conies amiss to me all the
players takes their characters from me
after this introduction you are a clever fellow i'll be bound for
it said dashall
o yes i acts richard the third sometimes sometimes macbeth and
tom thumb i have played before mr kean then i acted richard the
third give me a horse starting into the middle the room no
stop not so let me see let me see how is it ah this is the
way give me a horse oh oh oh then you know i dies and down he
fell on the floor which created a general roar laughter while
billy waters struck up see the conquering hero conies to the
inexpressible delight all around him their feet and hands all going
at the same time
mother mapps dropp'd her pipe and d d the weed it made her sick
she said
limping billy was also evidently in queerstreet 
come said sparkle won't you have a drop more
thank ye sir was the reply and sparkle intent upon having his
gig out ordered a fresh supply which soon revived the fallen hero 
bosworthfield and richard was himself again
now said he i'll sing you a song and immediately commenced as
follows
my name's hookey walker i'm known very well
in acting and eating i others excel
the playerfolks all take their patterns from me
and a nice pattern too don't you see don't you see
oh glancing at his fingers it will do it will do
at cheltenham born i was left quite forlorn
when my father was dead and my mother was gone
so i came up to london a nice little he
and a nice pattern too don't you see don't you see
oh it will do it will do
a courting i went to a girl in our court
she laugh'd at my figure and made me her sport
i was cut to the soul so said i on my knee
i'm a victim love don't you see don't you see
oh it won't do it won't do
now all day i march to and fro in the street
and a candle sometimes on my journey i eat
so i'll set you a pattern if you'll but agree
and a nice pattern too you shall see you shall see
oh it will do it will do
this song which he declared was all made out his own head was
sung with grotesque action and ridiculous grimace intended no doubt in
imitation mr wilkinson in his inimitable performance this strange
piece whimsicality the dancing party was knock'd up and were sobbing
their holly half asleep and half awake on the table bowing as
it were to the magnanimous influence
 sobbing their holly laying their heads
 old tom the dustman and the irishman laugh'd heartily
and das hall tallyhoho and sparkle could not resist the impulse
to risibility when they contemplated the group before them the
bugdestroyer munched a candle and sluiced his greasy
chops with jacky almost as fast as they could supply him
with it when sparkle perceiving the boy was still at the door with the
runaway ass
come said he we'll start em off home in high style here you mr
bugman can you ride
ride aye to be sure i can any mr ashley's horses as well as the
champion england was the reply
 old tom it is customary in publichouses and ginshops
in london and its vicinity to exhibit a cask inscribed with
large letters old tom intended to indicate the best gin in
the house
 munched eat
 sluiced washed see sluice
 chops the mouth
 jacky a vulgar term for gin
 any person would almost suspect that hookey had been
reading the newspapers by this allusion but that certainly
could not be the case for spurning all education in early
life this representative the immortal bard this
character characters from shakespeare could neither read
nor write but made all he acted as he said from his own
head however it may fairly be presumed that in the course
 his travels during the day he had heard something the
champion intended to appear at the approaching coronation
 whom the following account has recently been circulated
through the daily press and with his usual consistency
conceived his own innate abilities equal to those which
might be acquired by mr dymocke though his claims were not
equally honourable or advantageous
mr dymocke the nephew the gentleman who is a
clergyman entitled by hereditary right to do the service 
the champion to his majesty is still in hopes he may be
permitted to act under his uncle's nomination although he
wants a few months being age a petition is before the
king on the subject and mr dymocke by constant practice
at ashley's hidingschool is endeavouring to qualify
himself for the due fulfilment the office on thursday
lie went through his exercise in a heavy suit armour with
great celerity the horse which will be rode by the champion
has been selected from mr ashley's troop it is a fine
animal piebald black and white and is regularly
exercised in the part he will have to perform
walk in walk in ladies and gentlemen just going to begin come mr
merryman all ready ladies and gentlemen please to observe this here
horse is not that there horse
so we laugh at john bull a little
come then continued sparkle another glass halfacrown to
ride to the bottom the lane and up holboruhill on that donkey at the
door and you shall be our champion
a bargain a bargain said the assumed hookey walker rubbing the
tallow from his gills 
here goes then said sparkle then slipping halfacrown into the
boy's hand desiring him to run as far as the travelleroffice in
fleetstreet and get him a newspaper promising to take care his
ass till his return the lad nibbled the bait and was off in a pig's
whisper sparkle called to tom and bob and putting them up to
his scheme hookey was quickly mounted while dashall and his cousin
assisted by the hibernian and dustho succeeded in getting mother mapps
out who was placed in the front the champion astride with her face
towards him and limping billy who though beat to a stand still 
was after some difficulty lifted up behind hookey was then supplied
with his board the pole which he placed on his foot in the manner
 a spear or lance then giving the irishman and the dustman some
silver to act as supporters or esquires one on each side they
proceeded along shoelane preceded by billy waters flourishing his
woodenleg and feathers and fiddling as he went the irishman roaring
out with stentorian lungs
sure won't you hear
what roaring cheer
was spread at paddy's wedding o
and how so gay
they spent the day
from the churching to the bedding o
first in hand came father quires
with the bride's daddy the bailey o
while all the way to church the pipes
struck up a jilt so gaily o
kim ap be after sitting fast in the front there old mapps or
you'll make a mudlark yourself the dustman rang his bell and thus
accompanied with an immense assemblage boys girls men women and
 gills the mouth
 pig's whisper a very common term for speed
 beat to a dead stand still means completely unable to
assist himself
children collected from all the courts and alleys in the
neighbourhood joining in a chorus shouts that rent the air poor
balaam continued to bear his load while our party after watching them
till nearly out sight passed down harpalley into fleetmarket and
turning to the right very soon regained fleetstreet laughing heartily
at the bull's cookery mackarel buttered with brickdust and very
well satisfied with their spree
engaged in conversation upon this adventure they found nothing 
interest or amusement to attract their notice till they arrived at the
warehouse the london genuine tea company except merely remarking the
grand appearance st paul's from that situation
genuine tea said bob what can that mean is tea any thing but tea
to be sure it is said sparkle or has been any thing but teal
strongly marking the latter part the
 tea and coffee the adulteration articles human food
is a practice the most nefarious description and cannot
be too strongly deprecated although it has been carried to
an alarming extent there is scarcely an article ordinary
consumption but has been unlawfully adulterated and in many
cases rendered injurious by the infamous and fraudulent
practice interested persons bread which is considered
to be the staff life and beer and ale the universal
beverage the people this country are known to be
frequently mixed with drugs the most pernicious quality
gin that favourite and heartinspiring cordial the lower
orders society that it may have the grip or the
appearance being particularly strong is frequently
adulterated with the decoction long pepper or a small
quantity aquafortis a deadly poison sugar has been
known to be mixed with sand and tobacco for the publichouses
undergoes a process for making it strong and
intoxicating but the recent discovery the nefarious
practice adulterating tea and coffee articles the
most universal and extensive consumption deserves
particular reprehension
tea has been adulterated by the introduction dried sloe
leaves the practice is not very new but its extensive
adoption and the deleterious properties ascribed to them by
physicians have been at length successfully exposed by
the conviction many the venders so it is hoped as
to prevent a repetition the crime the sloe leaf though
a spurious commodity when sold as tea might afford a
harmless vegetable infusion and be recommended to the poor
and frugal as a cheap succedaneum for the chinese vegetable
the establishment the genuine tea company on ludgatehill
originated in the recent discoveries promising to sell
nothing but the unadulterated tea and it is sincerely to be
hoped has done some good
sentence as he spoke it horsebeans have been converted to
coffee and sloeleaves have been transformed into tea hog's lard has
been manufactured for butter an ingenious gentleman wishes to persuade
us periwinkles are young lobsters and another has proposed to
extract sugar and some say brandy out peashells london is the
mart for inventions and discoveries all kinds and every one its
inhabitants appears to have studied something the art legerdemain
to catch the eye and deceive the senses
wonderful exclaimed bob
not more wonderful than true continued sparkle invention is always
on the stretch in london here we have castiron bridges a castiron
sugarhouse
 sparkle appears to have been rather sceptical on the
subject periwinkles being young lobsters though the
opinion is not very new a gentleman whose indefatigable
research appears to be deserving encouragement and
support has recently issued the following advertisement
inviting the curious and the learned to inspect the result
 his discoveries which seems at least to warrant
something more than conjecture
j leghorn having in his possession some specimens which
prove in his opinion a circumstance before suggested but
treated by the scientific as a vulgar error any known
naturalist willing to view them by noticing by letter
within a week may have j c attend with his specimens the
subject is a curious change in the formation lobsters
from various species the winkle the winkle being
considered the larva
the only advantage j c desires from the communication is
the credit advancing his proofs and the stimulating
further enquiry a line addressed to j leghorn
architectural engraver no chapmanstreet blackroad
islington will have immediate attention
it is sincerely to be hoped that proper notice will be taken
 this advertisement for in times general scarcity like
the present such a discovery might be turned to great
national advantage by the establishment proper depots
for the cultivation lobsters as we have preserves for
game c
 castiron has become an object general utility the
southwark or new london bridge consists three arches the
centre which is a span feet and the other two 
feet each the vauxhall bridge consists nine arches over
a width feet and it is a fact that a sugarhouse is
building with castiron floors windowframes and rafters
to prevent fire castiron holds fire and resists fire but
it is probable that all its properties and powers are not
yet discovered and that we may some day or other witness
the ascension a castiron balloon inflated with steam
coaches running and barges packets and sailingboats navigated
by steam st paul's as you perceive without its ball smoke
burning itself and money burning men's consciences
well done sparkle cried tom your ideas seem to flow like gas
touch but the valve and off you go and you are equally diffusive for
you throw a light upon all subjects
bob was now suddenly attracted by a full view himself and his friends
at the further everington's
 steam here is a subject that evaporates as we approach
it soars beyond finite comprehension and appears to be
inexhaustible every thing is done by it machinery every
kind is set in motion by it a newspaper the most
extensive circulation in the kingdom is printed by it and
the paper supplied sheet by sheet to receive the impression
tobacco is manufactured and sausagemeat cut by steam
nay a celebrated vender the latter article had asserted
that his machinery was in such a state progressive
improvement that he had little doubt before long making
it supply the demands his customers and thereby save the
expense a showman but it is much to be regretted his
apparatus made sausagemeat him before the accomplishment
 his project
considering the increasing and by some philosophers almost
overwhelming population the country at the present
moment it is certainly an alarming circumstance that when
employment is so much required mechanical science should so
completely supersede it to the injury thousands
independent the many who have lost their lives by the
blowing up steamengines it is a malady however which
must be left to our political economists who will
doubtless at the same time determine which would prove the
most effectual remedy the recommendation mr malthus to
condemn the lower orders to celibacy the jack tars to a
good war or the ministers to emigration
 if an estimate the wealth or poverty the nation
were to lie formed from the appearance the houses in the
metropolis no one could be induced to believe that the
latter had any existence among us the splendour and taste
 our streets is indescribable and the vast improvements
in the west are equally indicative the former
the enormous increase rents for shops particularly in
the leading thoroughfares london may in a great measure
be attributed to the linendrapers the usual method
practised by some these gentry is to take a shop in the
firstrate situation pull down the old front and erect a
new one regardless expense a good outside being
considered the first and indispensable requisite this is
often effected either upon credit with a builder or if
they have a capital a few hundreds it is all exhausted
in external decorations goods are obtained upon credit and
customers procured by puffing advertisements and exciting
astonishment at the splendid appearance the front thus
the concern is generally carried on till the credit obtained
has expired and the wonder and novelty the concern has
evaporated when the stock is sold off at per cent
under prime cost for the benefit the creditors this is
so common an occurrence that it is scarcely possible to
walk through london any day in the year without being
attracted by numerous linendrapers shops whose windows
are decorated with bills indicating that they are actually
selling off under prime cost as the premises must be
cleared in a few days
the most elegant shop this description in the metropolis
is supposed to be one not a hundred miles from ludgatehill
the front and fitting up which alone is said to have cost
several thousand pounds the interior is nearly all 
lookingglass with gilt moulding even the ceiling is
lookingglass from which is appended splendid cutglass
chandeliers which when lighted give to the whole the
brilliance enchantment however it is not very easy to
form an idea what is sold for with the exception a
shawl or two carelessly thrown into the window there is
nothing to be seen the stock being all concealed in
drawers cupboards c except the decorations and the
dandy shorten who parade up and down in a state ecstasy
at the reflection their own pretty persons from every
part the premises
this concealment the stock has occasioned some laughable
occurrences it is said that a gentleman from the country
accidentally passing took it for a lookingglass
manufactory and went in to inquire the price a glass
the shorten gathered round him with evident surprise
assured him his mistake and directed him to go to
blades lower down the hill the countryman was not
disconcerted but after surveying them somewhat minutely
informed them it was glass he wanted not cutlery but as
for blades he thought there were enow there for one street
at least
another is said to have been so pleased with a row 
grotesque indianchina jars which embellish one side the
entrance and which he mistook for pots de chambre that
after returning home and consulting his rib he sent an
order per post for one the most elegant pattern to be
forwarded to him
there is a similar shop to this though on a smaller scale
to be seen in a great leading thoroughfare at the west 
 the town the owner which from his swarthy complexion
and extravagant mode dress has been denominated the
black prince a name by which he is well known in his own
neighbourhood and among the gentlemen the cloth this
dandy gentleman who affects the dress and air a military
officer has the egregious vanity to boast that the numerous
families rank and fashion who frequent his shop are
principally attracted to view his elegant person and seems
to consider that upon this principally depends the success
 his trade
 a large glassmanufacturer
 shop and without observing the other persons about him saw
himself surrounded with spectators unconscious being in their
company he look'd up he look'd down he gazed around him and all was
inconceivable light tom's allusion to the gas flashed upon him in a
moment what what is this said he where in the name wonder am
i a flash lightning could not have operated more suddenly upon him
why said sparkle don't you see
you are not here for you are there
pointing to his reflection in the lookingglass
egad said bob under evident surprise and perhaps not without
some apprehension they were playing tricks with him i wish you would
explain is this a drawingroom or is it the phantasmagoria we have
heard so much in the country
no no it is not the phantasmagoria but it forms a part 
metropolitan magic which you shall be better acquainted with before we
part that is no other than a linendraper's shop papered as
an irishman one day remarked void nothing at all at all but
lookingglass my dear one the most superb things the kind that
perhaps ever was seen but come i perceive it is getting late let us
proceed directly to dolly's take our chop then a rattler and hey
for the spell
bob appeared almost to be spellbound at the moment and as they moved
onward could not help casting
one longing lingering look behind
 rattler a coach
 spell the playhouse so denominated from its variety 
attractions both before and behind the curtain

to drurylane 
now said the hon tom dashall i shall introduce you to a new scene
in real life well worth your close observation we have already taken
a promiscuous ramble from the west towards the east and it has afforded
some amusement but our stock is abundant and many objects curiosity
are still in view
yes yes continued sparkle every day produces novelty for although

nature
by this time they had alighted and were entering the house the rapid
succession carriages arriving with the company the splendour the
equipages the general elegance the dresses and the blazing the
lamps alternately became objects attraction to bob whose eyes were
kept in constant motion while a bill the play for covent garden or
drury lane still resounded in their ears
illustration pages drury lane theatre
on arriving at the boxlobby tom who was well known was immediately
shewn into the centre box with great politeness by the boxkeeper
the second scene the tragedy being just over the appearance the
house was a delicious treat to bob whose visual orbs wandered more
among the delighted and delightful faces which surrounded him than to
the plot or the progress the performances before him it was a scene
 splendour which lie had not the least conception and sparkle
perceiving the principal objects attraction could not resist the
impulse to deliver in a sort halfwhisper the following lines
when woman's soft smile all our senses bewilders
and gilds while it carves her dear form on the heart
what need has new drury carvers and gilders
with nature so bounteous why call upon art
 the boxkeeper to a public theatre has many duties to
perform to the public his employer and himself but
perhaps in order to be strictly correct we ought to have
reversed the order in which we have noticed them since 
the three the latter appears to be the most important at
least in his consideration for he takes care before the
commencement the performance to place one his
automaton figures on the second row every box which
commands a good view the house who are merely intended
to sit with their hats off and to signify that the two
first seats are taken till the conclusion the second
act and so in point fact they are taken by himself for
the accommodation such friends as he is quite aware are
willing to accommodate him with a quid pro quo 
how well would our actors attend to their duties
our house save in oil and our authors in wit
in lieu yon lamps if a row young beauties
glanc'd light from their eyes between us and the pit
the apples that grew on the fruittree knowledge
by woman were pluck'd and she still wears the prize
to tempt us in theatre senate or college
i mean the loveapples that bloom in the eyes
there too is the lash which all statutes controlling
still governs the slaves that are made by the fair
for man is the pupil who while her eye's rolling
is lifted to rapture or sunk in despair
tallyho eagerly listened to his friend's recitation lines so
consonant with his own enraptured feelings while his cousin dashall was
holding a conversation in dumbshow with some person at a distance
who was presently recognized by sparkle to be mrs g den a
wellknown frequenter the house
come said he i see how it is with tom you may rely upon it he
will not stop long where he is there is other game in view he has but
little taste for tragedy fiction the realities life are the objects
 his regard
tis a fine tragedy continued he addressing himself to tom
yes yes replied the other i dare say it is but upon my soul
i know nothing about it that is i have seen it before and i mean to
read it
bless my heart said a fat lady in a back seat what a noise them
are gentlemen does make they talk so loud there ant no such thing
as seeing what is said i wonder they don't make these here boxes more
bigger for i declare i'm so scrooge i'm all in a fanny did you bring
the umbrella for fear it should rain as we goes home
hush mother said a plumpfaced little girl who sat along side 
her don't talk so loud or otherwise every body will hear you instead
 the performers and that would be quite preposterous
don't call me prosperous miss because you have been to school and
learnt some edification you thinks you are to do as you please with
me
 mrs g den a dashing cyprian the first order well
known in the house a fine wellmade woman always ready
for a lark and generally well togged
this interesting conversation was interrupted by loud
vociferations bravo bravo from all parts the house as the
dropscene fell upon the conclusion the second act the clapping 
hands the whistling and noise that ensued for a few minutes appeared
to astonish tallyhoho i don't much like my seat said dashall no
said sparkle i did not much expect you would remain long you are a
mighty ambitious sort fellow and i perceive you have a desire to be
exalted
i confess the situation is too confined replied tom come it is
excessively warm here let us take a turn and catch a little air
the house was crowded in every part for the announcement a new
tragedy from the pen lord byron particularly under the circumstances
 its introduction to the stage against the expressed inclination 
its author the
 at an early hour on the evening this tragedy was first
produce at drury lane handbills were plentifully
distributed through the theatre which the following is a
copy
the public are respectfully informed that the
representation lord byron's tragedy the doge venice
this evening takes place in defiance the injunction from
the lord chancellor which was not applied for until the
remonstrance the publisher at the earnest desire the
noble author had failed in protecting that drama from its
intrusion on the stage for which it was never intended
this announcement had the effect exciting public
expectation beyond its usual pitch upon such occasions the
circumstances were somewhat new in the history the drama
the question being whether a published flay could be
legally brought on the stage without the consent or rather
we should say in defiance the author we are not aware
whether this question has been absolutely decided but this
we do know that the piece was performed several nights and
underwent all the puffing the adventurous manager as
well as all the severity the critics the newspapers 
the day were filled with histories and observations upon it
no subject engrossed the conversation the polite and
playgoing part the community but lord byron the doge 
venice and mr ellison they were all praised and
plastered exalted and debased acquitted and condemned
but it was generally allowed on all hands that the printed
tragedy contained many striking beauties notwithstanding
its alleged resemblance to venice preserved we are
however speaking the acted tragedy and the magnanimous
manager who with such promptitude produced it in an altered
shape and having already alluded to the theatrical puffing
so constantly resorted to upon all occasions we shall drop
the curtain upon the subject after merely remarking that
the times the same day has been known to contain the
manager's puff declaring the piece to have been
received with rapturous applause in direct opposition
to the editor's critique which as unequivocally pronounced
its complete failure
will its publisher and the injunctions the lord
chancellor were attractions no ordinary nature and
 injunction the word injunction implies a great deal and
has in its sound so much the terrific as in many
instances to paralyze exertion on the part the supposed
offending person or persons it has been made the instrument
 artful designing and malicious persons aided by
pettifogging or pretended attorneys to obtain money for
themselves and clients by way compromise and in numerous
instances it is well known that fear has been construed into
actual guilt injunctions are become so common that even
penny print sellers have lately issued threats and promised
actual proceedings against the venders articles said to
be copies from their original drawings and even carried it
so far as to withhold kind souls the execution their
promises upon the payment a l from those who were
easily to be duped having no inclination to encounter the
glorious uncertainty the law or no time to spare for
litigation we have recently been furnished with a curious
case which occurred in utopia where it appears by our
informant that the laws hold great similarity with our own
a certain house considerable respectability had imported
a large quantity welsh cheese which were packed in
wooden boxes and offered them for sale a great rarity in
utopia as double gloucester
it is said that two a trade seldom agree how far the
adage may apply to utopia will be seen in the sequel a
tradesman residing in the next street a short time after
received an importation from gloucester the favourite
double production that place packed in a similar way
and as was very natural for a tradesman to do at least we
know it is so here the latter immediately began to vend
his cheese as the real double gloucester this was an
offence beyond bearing the high court equity was moved
similar we suppose to our high court chancery to
suppress the sale the latter but as no proof 
deception could be produced it was not granted this only
increased the flame already excited in the breasts the
first importers every effort was made use to find a good
and sufficient excuse to petition the court again and at
length they found out one the craft to swear that as the
real gloucester had been imported in boxes a similar
shape make and wood it was quite evident that the
possessor must have bought similar cheeses and was imposing
on the public to their great disadvantage notwithstanding
they could not find a similarity either taste smell or
appearance in the mean time the real gloucester cheese
became a general favourite with the inhabitants utopia
and upon this though slender ground the innocent tradesman
was served with a process enjoining him not to do that
which poor man he never intended to do and besides if he
had the people that country were not such ignoramuses as
to be so deceived it was merely to restrain him from
selling his own real double gloucester as their welsh
cheeses purporting as they did to be double gloucester
or mixing them together than which nothing could be
further from his thoughts and charging him at the same
time with having sold his cheeses under their name but the
most curious part the business was the real cheeseman
brought the investigation before the court cheeses in boxes
were produced and evidence was brought forward when as
the charges alleged could not be substantiated the
restraint was removed and the three importers welsh
cheese hung their heads and retired in dudgeon
the hon tom availed himself the circumstance to leave the box
though the truth was there were other attractions a more enlivening
cast in his view
come said he we shall have a better opportunity seeing the
house and its decorations by getting nearer to the curtain besides
ave shall have a bird'seye view the company in all quarters from
the seat the gods to the pit
the influx company it being the time halfprice and the
rush and confusion which took place in all parts at this moment were
indescribable jumping over boxes and obtaining seats by any means
regardless politeness or even decorum bucks and bloods warm
from the pleasures the bottle dashing belles and flaming beaux
squabbling and almost fighting rendered the amusements before the
curtain a momentary interest which appeared to obliterate the
recollection what they had previously witnessed in the mean time
the gods in the gallery issued forth an abundant variety discordant
sounds from their elevated situation growling bears grunting 
hogs braying donkeys gobbling turkeys hissing geese
the catcall and the loud shrill whistle were heard in one mingling
concatenation excellent imitation and undistinguished variety during
which tom led the way to the upper boxes where upon arriving he
was evidently disappointed at not meeting the party who had been
seen occupying a seat on the left side the house besides having
sacrificed a front seat to be now compelled to take one at the very
back part a side box an exchange by no means advantageous for a view
 the performance however this was compensated in some degree by a
more extensive prospect round the house and his eyes were seen moving
in all directions without seeming to know where to fix while sparkle
and bob were attracted by a fight in the gallery between a soldier and
a gentleman's servant in livery for some supposed insult offered
to the companion the latter and which promised serious results
from the repeated vociferations those around them throw em
over throw em over while the gifts the gods were plentifully
showered down upon the inhabitants the lower regions in the shape
 orangepeelings apples c the drawing up the curtain however
seemed to have some little effect upon the audience and in a moment the
babel tongues was changed into a pretty general cry down down
in the front hats off silence c which at length subsided in every
quarter but the gallery where still some muttering and murmuring were
at intervals to be heard
one fiddle will
produce a tiny flourish still
sparkle could neither see nor hear the performance tom was wholly
engaged in observing the company and bob alternately straining his neck
to get a view the stage and then towards the noisy inhabitants 
the upper regions we dined at the hummums said a finicking little
gentleman just below him bill and i and harry drank claret like
fishes harry was halfsprung fell out with a parson about chopping
logic you know harry's father was a butcher and used to chopping
so it was all prime the parson wouldn't be convinced though harry
knock'd down his argument with his knuckles on the table almost hard
enough to split it it was a bangup lark harry got in a passion
doffed his toggery and was going to show fight so then the parson
sneak'd off such a bit gig
silence there behind
so then continued the dandy we went to the billiardrooms in fleet
street played three games diddled the flats bilk'd the marker and
bolted i say when did you see dolly
 to the frequenters drurylane theatre who occasionally
lounge away a little their time between the acts in
sipping sodawater negus c the party here alluded to
cannot but be well known we mean particularly the laffing
boys and the lads the village we are aware that
fictitious names are assumed or given to the ladies 
saloon notoriety originating in particular circumstances
and we have reason to believe that dolly k ally has been
so denominated from the propensity she almost invariably
manifests painting as remarked particularly by one 
the parties in conversation
last night replied the other she'll be here
presently d nd fine girl ain't she
very well said the first a nice plump face but then she paints
so d n ably i hate your painted dolly give me natural flesh and
blood polly h ward for me
gallows tom will speak to you in plain terms if you trespass there
my boy you know he has outgeneral's the captain in that quarter and
came off victorious so 
come said sparkle let us adjourn into the saloon for heaven
knows it is useless staying here and taking their arms they
immediately left the box
the theatre continued he is a sort enchanted island where
nothing appears as it really is nor what it should be in london it is
a sort timekiller or exchange looks and smiles it is frequented
by persons all degrees and qualities whatsoever here lords come
to laugh and be laughed at knights to learn the amorous smirk and

this house was built upon a grand and extensive scale designed and
executed under the inspection mr bent wyatt the architect whose

is altogether a masterpiece art and an ornament to the metropolis
you perceive the interior is truly delightful and the exterior presents
the idea solidity and security it affords sitting room for

 it appears that the adoption fictitious names is not
wholly confined to the female visitors these regions

and is a sort general friend at all times full fun
fire and spirit we have not been able to discover whether
he holds any official situation under government though it
is generally believed he is safely anchored under the croup

so than to his own and we should judge from what is to be
inferred from the conversation overheard that he is the

atlantic first blazed forth to astonish the world beneath this roof
old drury immortalized the name garrick and has also established the
fame mr kean and the house at the present moment has to boast a

come along come along said tom interrupting him leave these
explanations for another opportunity here is the saloon now for a peep
at old particulars there is no seeing nor hearing the play i have no
inclination for histories i am just alive for a bit gig
on entering the saloon bob was additionally gratified at viewing
the splendour its decorations the arched ceiling the two massy
corinthian columns vera antique and the ten corresponding
pilasters on each side struck him as particularly beautiful and he was
for some moments lost in contemplation while his friends sparkle and
tom were in immediate request to receive the congratulations their
acquaintance
where the d l have you been to was the first question addressed
to dashall rusticating i suppose to the serious loss all polished
society
you are right in the first part your reply said tom but as i
conceive not exactly so in the inference you draw from it
modesty by jove well done dashall this travelling appears to improve
your manners wonderfully and i dare say if you had staid away another
month your old friends would not have known you
this created a laugh among the party which roused bob from his reverie
who turning round rather hastily trod with considerable force upon
the gouty toe an old debauchee in spectacles who in the height
 ecstasy was at that moment entering into a treaty amity with a
pretty rosyfaced little girl and chucking her under the
 the names ellison pope johnston powell dowton

chin as a sort preliminary to be succeeded by a ratification
for in all probability gratification was out the question however
this might be the pain occasioned by the sudden movement tallyhoho
who had not yet learned to trip it lightly along the mutton walk 
induced the sufferer to roar out most lustily a circumstance which
immediately attracted the attention every one in the room and in a
moment they were surrounded by a group lads and lasses
illustration pages tom and bob at drury lane
upon my soul sir stammered out bob i beg your pardon i i did
not mean 
oh oh oh continued the gouty amoroso mother k p came
running like lightning with a glass water the frail sisterhood
were laughing nodding whispering and winking at each other while
st ns who pick'd up the spectacles the unfortunate victim 
the gout had dropp'd swore that fellow in the green coat and white
hat ought to be sent to some dancingschool to learn to step without
kicking people's shins
another declared he was a johnnyraw just catched and what could be
expected
tom who however kept himself alive to the passing occurrences
stepping up to bob was immediately recognized by all around him and
passing a significant wink declared it was an accident and begged to
assist the old buck to a seat which being accomplished he declared
he had not had his shoe on for a week but as he found himself able to
walk he could not resist the temptation taking a look around him
over a bottle wine the unpleasant impressions made by this
unfortunate occurrence appeared to be removed in the mean time tom
received a hundred congratulations and salutations while sparkle after
a glass or two was missing
dashall informed the friends around him that his cousin was a pupil 
his and begged to introduce him
 mutton walk a flash term recently adopted to denominate
the saloon
 a well known fruitwoman who is in constant attendance
well acquainted with the girls and their protectors and
ready upon all occasions to give or convey information for
the benefit both parties
 st ns a very pretty roundfaced young ladybird 
rather small figure inclining to be lusty
 johnny raw a country bumpkin
as a future visitor to this gay scene this had an instantaneous
effect upon the trading fair ones who began immediately to throw out
their lures one declared he had a sweet pretty brooch another that
she knew he was a trump by the cut his jib a third that he look'd
like a gentleman for she liked the make his mug a fourth that his
hat was a very pretty shaped one although it was a radical colour
and while tom and the ladybirdl were soothing the pains the
greyheaded wanton bob was as busily employed in handing about the
contents the bottle a second and a third succeeded and it was nota
little astonishing to him that every bottle improved his appearance
for though not one his admirers remained long with him yet the
absence one only brought another equally attracted by his look and
manner every one declared he was really a gentleman in every respect
and in the course their short parley did not fail to slip a card
into his hand by this time he began to grow chatty and was enabled
to rally in turn the observations they made he swore he lov'd them all
round and once or twice hummed over
dear creatures we can't do without them
they're all that is sweet and seducing to man
looking sighing about and about them
we doat on them do for them all that we can
the play being over brought a considerable influx company into
the saloon the regular copies paired off with their caresses and the
moving panorama elegance and fashion presented a scene that was truly
delightful to bob
the ladybird who had been so attentive to the gouty customer now
wished him a good night for said she there is my friend and so i
am off this seemed only to increase the agony his already agonized
toe notwithstanding which he presently toddled off and was seen no
more for the evening
what's become sparkle enquired tom stole away was the reply
tipp'd us the double has he said dashall well what think you 
drurylane
 ladybird a dashing cyprian
 the term friend is in constant use among accessible
ladies and signifies their protector or keeper
tis a very delightful tragedy indeed but performed in the most
comical manner i ever witnessed in my life
pshaw said bob very few indeed except the critics and the plebs
come here to look at the play they come to see and be seen
egad then said bob a great many have been gratified tonight and
perhaps i have been highly honoured for every person that has passed me
has complimented me with a stare
which course you did not fail to return
certainly not and upon my soul you have a choice show fruit here
yes continued tom london is a sort hothouse where fruit is
forced into ripeness by the fostering and liberal sun folly sooner
than it would be if left to its natural growth here however you
observe nothing but joyful and animated features while perhaps the
vulture misery is gnawing at the heart i could give you histories 
several these unfortunates
 a life prostitution is a life fraught with too many
miseries to be collected in any moderate compass the mode
in which they are treated by parties who live upon the
produce their infamy the rude and boisterous nay often
brutal manner in which they are used by those with whom they
occasionally associate and the horrible reflections 
their own minds are too frequently and too fatally
attempted to be obliterated by recourse to the bacchanalian
fount reason becomes obscured and all decency and
propriety abandoned passion rules predominantly until it
extinguishes itself and leaves the wretched victim early
delusion vitiated both in body and mind to drag on a
miserable existence without character without friends and
almost without hope there is unfortunately however no
occasion for the exercise imagination on this subject
the annals our police occurrences furnish too many
examples actual circumstances deeply to be deplored and
we have selected one a most atrocious kind which recently
took place and is recorded as follows
prostitution 
an unfortunate girl apparently about eighteen years 
age and the most interesting and handsome person but
whose attire indicated extreme poverty and distress applied
to the sitting magistrate richard bimie esq under the
following circumstances it appeared from the statement
that she had for the last three weeks been living at a house
 ill fame in exeterstreet strand kept by a man named
james locke this wretch had exacted the enormous sum 
three guineas per week for her board and lodging and inconsequence
 her not being able to pay the sum due for the
last week he threatened to strip her her cloaths and
turn her naked into the street this threat he deferred
executing until yesterday morning having in the mean time
kept her locked up in a dark room without any covering
whatever when in lieu her cloaths he gave her the
tattered and loathsome garments she then appeared in which
were barely sufficient to preserve common decency and then
brutally turned her into the street being thus plunged into
the most abject wretchedness without money or friends to
whom she could apply in her present situation her bodily
strength exhausted by the dissipated life she had led and
rendered more so by a long abstinence from food her spirits
broken and overcome by the bitter and humiliating
reflection that her own guilty conduct debarred her from
flying to the fostering arms affectionate parents whom
she had loaded with disgrace and misery and the now
inevitable exposure her infamy it was some time ere her
wandering senses were sufficiently composed to determine
what course she should pursue in the present emergency when
she thought she could not do better than have recourse to
the justice her country against the villain lock who had
so basely treated her and after extreme pain and
difficulty she succeeded in dragging her enfeebled limbs to
the office during the detail the foregoing particulars
she seemed overwhelmed with shame and remorse and at times
sobbed so violently as to render her voice inarticulate her
piteous case excited the attention and sympathy all
present and it was much to the general satisfaction that
mr bimie ordered humphrey one the conductors the
patrol to fetch lock to the office on being brought there
the necessary proceedings were gone into for the purpose 
indicting the house as a common brothel
it was afterwards discovered that this unhappy girl was 
the most respectable parents and for the last six years had
been residing with her aunt about three months ago some
difference having arisen between them she absconded taking
with her only a few shillings and the clothes she then
wore the first night her remaining from home she went to
drurylane theatre and was there pick'd up by a genteel
woman dressed in black who having learned her situation
enticed her to a house in hartstreet coventgarden where
the ruin the poor girl was finally effected it was not
until she had immersed herself in vice and folly that she
reflected on her situation and it was then too late to
retract and after suffering unheard miseries was in
the short space three months reduced to her present
state wretchedness
the worthy magistrate ordered that proper care should betaken
 the girl which was readily undertaken on the part
 the parish
the prisoner set up a defence in which he said a friend
 the girl's owed him l and that he detained her clothes
for it but was stopped by mr bimie
he at first treated the matter very lightly but on
perceiving the determination on the part the parish to
proceed he offered to give up the things this however he
was not allowed to do
who are exercising all their arts to entrap customers apparently full
 life and vivacity who perhaps dare not approach their homes
without the produce their successful blandishments but this is not a
place for moralizing a truce to old care and the blue devils come on
my boy let us take a turn in the lobby
banish sorrow griefs a folly
saturn bend thy wrinkled brow
get thee hence dull melancholy
mirth and wine invite us now
love displays his mine treasure
comus brings us mirth and song
follow follow follow pleasure
let us join the jovial throng
upon this they adjourned to the lobby where a repetition similar
circumstances took place with only this difference that tally ho
having already been seen in the saloon and now introduced leaning upon
the arm his cousin the enticing goddesses pleasure hung
around them at every step every one anxious to be foremost in their
assiduities to catch the newcomer's smile and the odds were almost a
cornucopia to a cabbagenet that bob would be hook'd
tom was still evidently disappointed and after pacing the lobby once or
twice and whispering bob to make his observations the subject future
inquiry they returned to the saloon where sparkle met them almost out
 breath declaring he had been hunting them in all parts the house
for the last half hour
tom laugh'd heartily at this and complimented sparkle on the ingenuity
with which he managed his affairs but i see how it is said he and
i naturally suppose you are engaged
suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind and i perceive clearly that
you are only disappointed that you are not engaged where are all your
golden dreams now
pshaw there is no such thing as speaking to you said tom rather
peevishly without feeling a lash like a cartwhip
 this was a touch the satirical which it appears did not
exactly suit the taste dashall as it applied to the
ladybird who had attracted his attention on entering the
house
merely in return continued sparkle for the genteel not to
say gentle manner in which you handle the horsewhip
there is something very mulish in all this said bob interrupting the
conversation i don't understand it
nor i neither said tom leaving the arm his cousin and stepping
forward
this hasty dismissal the subject under debate had been occasioned by
the appearance a lady whose arm tom immediately took upon leaving
that his cousin a circumstance which seemed to restore harmony to
all parties tallyhoho and sparkle soon joined them and after a few turns
for the purpose seeing and being seen it was proposed to adjourn
to the oystershop directly opposite the front the theatre and with
that view they in a short time departed but not without an addition 
two other ladies selected from the numerous frequenters the saloon
most whom appeared to be well known both to tom and sparkle
the appearance the outside was very pleasing the brilliance the
lights the neat and cleanly style in which its contents were displayed
seemed inviting to appetite and in a very short time a cheerful repast
was served up while the room was progressively filling with company
and mother p was kept in constant activity
bob was highly gratified with the company and the manner in which they
were entertained
a vast crowd dashing young beaux and elegantly dressed belles
calling about them for oysters lobsters salmon shrimps bread
and butter sodawater gingerbeer c kept up a sort running
accompaniment to the general conversation in which they were engaged
when the mirth and hilarity the room was for a moment delayed upon
the appearance a dashing blade who seemed as he entered to say to
himself
plebeians avaunt i have altered my plan metamorphosed completely
behold a fine man that is throughout town i am grown quite the rage
the meteor fashion the buck the age
he was dressed in the extreme fashion and seemed desirous 
imparting the idea his great importance to all around him he had
a lightcoloured greatcoat with immense mother o pearl buttons
and double capes buff or petersham breeches and coat 
skyblue his hat cocked on one side and stout groundashen stick
in his hand it was plain to be seen that the juice the grape had
been operative upon the upper story as he reeled to the further 
the room and calling the attendant desired her to bring him a bottle
 sodawater for he was lusty by g d then throwing himself
into a box which he alone occupied he stretched himself at length on
the seat and seemed as if he would go to sleep
that said sparkle is a distinguished member the tilbury club and
is denominated a ruffian a kind character that gains ground as to
numbers over the exquisite but he is very different in polish
 a partiality to these coloured habits is undoubtedly
intended to impress upon the minds plebeian beholders an
exalted idea their own consequence or to prove perhaps
that their conceptions are as superior to common ones as the
sky is to the earth
 the variety denominations that have at different times
been given to drunkenness forms an admirable specimen 
ingenuity well worthy remark the derivation lusty we
believe is from a very common expression that a drunken
man votes for washington but perhaps it would be rather
difficult to discover the origin many terms made use 
to express a jolly good fellow and no flincher under the
effects good fellowship it is said that he is drunk
intoxicated fuddled muddled flustered rocky reply
tipsy merry halfbooty topheavy chuckfull cupsprung

in the higher circles a ruffian is one the many
mushroomproductions which the sun prosperity brings to life stout
in general is his appearance but dame nature has done little for him
and fortune has spoilt even that little to resemble his groom and his
coachman is his highest ambition he is a perfect horseman a perfect
whip but takes care never to be a perfect gentleman his principal
accomplishments are sporting swaggering milling drawing and
greeking he takes the ribands in his hands mounts his box with
missus by his side all right ya hip my hearties drives his empty
mail with four prime tits cuts out a johnnyraw shakes his head and
lolls out his tongue at him and if he don't break his own neck gets
safe home after his morning's drive
he is always accompanied by a brace at least dogs in his morning
visits and it is not easy to determine on these occasions which is the
most troublesome animal the two the biped or the quadruped
this description caused a laugh among the ladybirds who thought it
vastly amusing while it was also listened to with great attention by
tallyhoho
the hon tom dashall in the mean time was in close conversation with his
mott in the corner the box and was getting as sparkle observed
rather nutty in that quarter the globe
the laugh which concluded sparkle's account the tilburyclub man
roused him from his sleep and also attracted the attention tom and
his inamorata

whom or whence the word originated but we recollect some
lines an old song in which the term is made use viz
when first i saw this flaming mutt
twas at the sign the pewter pot
we call'd for some purl and we had it hot
with gin and bitters too
 nutty amorous
 an elegant and expressive term for the eyes
this was followed immediately by the rattling an engine with
two torches accompanied by an immense concourse people following it
at full speed past the window
it is well lit by jove said the sleeper awake where ever it is
and with that he tipp'd the slavey a tanner and muzzled
the noise and confusion outside the house completely put a stop to
all harmony and comfort within
it must be near us said tom
it is covent garden theatre in my opinion said sparkle
bob said nothing but kept looking about him in a sort
 wild surprise
however said tom wherever it is we must go and have a peep
you are a very gallant fellow truly said one the bewitches i
thought 
and so did i said tom but rest the babe the time it shall
come never mind we won't be disappointed but here said he as i
belong to the tip and toddle club i don't mean to disgrace my calling
by forgetting my duty and slipping a something into her hand her note
was immediately changed into
well i always thought you was a trump and i likes a man that behaves
like a gentleman
something the same kind was going on between the other two which
proved completely satisfactory
so then mr author it seems you have raised a fire to stew the
oysters and leave your readers to feast upon the blaze
hold for a moment and be not so testy and for your satisfaction i can
solemnly promise that if the oysters are stewed you shall have good
and sufficient notice the moment they are to be on table but bless
my heart how the fire rages i can neither spare time nor wind to
parley a moment longer tom and bob have already started off with the
velocity a racehorse and if i lose them i should cut but a poor
figure with my readers afterward
pray sir can you tell me where the fire is really sir i don't
know but i am told it is somewhere by whitechapel
 slaveys servants either sex
 tanner a flash term for a sixpence
could you inform me madam whereabouts the fire is
westminster road sir as i am informed westminster and
whitechapel some little difference opinion i find as usual however
i have just caught sight tom and he's sure to be on the right scent
so adieu mr reader for the present and have no doubt but i shall
soon be able to throw further light on the subject
chapter xi
some folks in the streets by the lord made me stare
so comical droll is the dress that they wear
for the gentlemen's waists are atop their backs
and their large cassock trowsers they tit just like sacks
then the ladies their dresses are equally queer
they wear such large bonnets no face can appear
it puts me in mind now don't think i'm a joker
 a coalscuttle stuck on the head a poker
in their bonnets they wear green leaves such a power
it puts me in mind a great cauliflower
and their legs am sure must be ready to freeze
for they wear all their petticoats up to their knees
they carry large bags full trinkets and lockets
cause the fashion is now not to wear any pockets
while to keep off the flies and to hide from beholders
a large cabbagenet is thrown over their shoulders
in a moment all was consternation confusion and alarm the
brilliant light that illuminated the surrounding buildings presented
a scene dazzling splendour mingled with sensations horror
not easily to be described the rattling engines the flashing 
torches and the shouting thousands by whom they were followed and
surrounded all combined to give lively interest to the circumstance
it was quickly ascertained that the dreadful conflagration had taken
place at an extensive timberyard within a very short distance 
the theatres situated as it were nearly in the centre between covent
garden and drury lane men women and children were seen running in
all directions and report with his ten thousand tongues here found an
opportunity for the exercise them all assertion and denial followed
each other in rapid succession while the flames continued to increase
our party being thus abruptly disturbed in their anticipated enjoyments
bade adieu to their doxies
 doxies a flash term frequently made use to denominate
ladies easy virtue
and rushed forward to the spot where they witnessed the devouring
ravages the yet unquenched element consuming with resistless force
all that came in its way
button up said tom and let us keep together for upon these
occasions
the scamps the pads the diversity are all upon the lay
the flash molishers in the vicinity drury lane were out in
parties and it was reasonable to suppose that where there was so much
heat considerable thirst must also prevail consequently the sorceries
were all in high request every one those in the neighbourhood being
able to boast overflowing houses without any imputation upon their
veracity we say nothing elegant genteel or enlightened audiences
so frequently introduced in the bills from other houses in the
neighbourhood even the doorways were block'd up with the collectors
and importers information prognostications as to how and where it
began how it would and the property that would be consumed were
to be met at every corner snuffy tabbies and booty kids some giving
way to jocularity and others indulging in lamentations
hot hot hot all hot said a black man as he pushed in and out
among the crowd with hoot awa the deil tak your soul mon don't
you think we are all hot enough gin ye bring more hot here i'll crack
your croon i've been roasting alive for the last half poor an want to
be ganging but i can't get out
hot hot hot all hot ladies and gentlemen said the dingy dealer
in delicacies and almost as soon disappeared among the crowd where he
found better opportunities for vending his rarities
lumps pudding said tom jerking tallyhoho by the arm what do you
think a slice here's accommodation for you all hot ready dress'd
and well done
egad said bob i think we shall be well done ourselves presently
keep your hands out my pockets you lousy beggar
 scamps highwaymen
 pads footpads
 divers pickpockets
 the lay upon the lookout for opportunities for the
exercise their profession
 flash polishes a term given to low prostitutes
said a tall man standing near them or b me if i don't mill
you
you mill me why you don't know how to go about it mr bully brag and
i doesn't care half a garden for you you go for to say as how i 
take that then said the other and gave him a floored but he was
prevented from falling by those around him
the salute was returned in good earnest and a random sort fight
ensued the accompaniments this exhibition were the shrieks the
women and the shouts the partisans each the bruisers the
cries go it little one stick to it tip it him serve him
out ring ring give em room foul foul fair fair c at this
moment the firemen who had been actively engaged in endeavours to
subdue the devouring flames obtained a supply water the engines
were set to work and the foreman directed the pipe so as to throw the
water completely into the mob which had collected round them this had
the desired effect putting an to the squabble and dispersing
a large portion the multitude at least to some distance so as to
leave good and sufficient room for their operations
the devil take it cried sparkle i am drench'd
ditto repeated said tom
curse the fellow cried bob i am stopped
never mind continued tom
 by fellowship in woe
scarce half our pain we know
since we are all in it there is no laughing allowed
in a short time the water flowed through the street in torrents the
pumping the engines and the calls the firemen were all
the noises that could be heard except now and then the arrival 
additional assistance
bob watched minutely the skill and activity those robust and hardy
men who were seen in all directions upon the tops houses c near
the calamitous scene giving information to those below and he was
astonished to see the rapidity with which they effected their object
having ascertained as far as they could the extent the damage
and that no lives were lost tom proposed a move and sparkle gladly
seconded the motion for said he i am so wet though i cannot
complain being cold that i think i resemble the fat man who
seemed something like two single gentlemen roll'd into one and who
after half a year's baking declared he had been so cursed hot he was
sure he'd caught cold so come along
past twelve o'clock said a charley about three parts sprung and
who appeared to have more light in his head than he could shew from his
lantern
stop thief stop thief was vociferated behind them and the night
music the rattles were in immediate use in several quarters a rush 
the crowd almost knock'd bob off his pins and he would certainly have
fell to the ground but his nobly came with so much force against the
breadbaskets the groggy guardian the night that he was turn'd
keel upwards and rolled with his lantern staff and rattle into
the overflowing kennel a circumstance which perhaps had really no
bad effect for in all probability it brought the sober senses the
charley a little more into action than the juice the juniper had
previously allowed he was dragged from his birth and his coat which
was the blanket kind brought with it a plentiful supply the
moistening fluid being literally sous'd from head to foot
bob fished for the darker the musical instrument and the
post honour alias the supporter peace but he was not yet
complete for he had dropped his canistercap which was at length
found by a flash polished and drawn from the pool full water who
appeared to know him and swore he was one the best fellows on any 
the beats round about and that they had got hold a fireprigger
and bundled him off to st giles's watchhouse because he was
bolting with a bag togs 
 nob the head
 breadbasket the stomach
 keel upwards originally a sea phrase and most in use
among sailors c
 darker generally made use to signify a dark lantern
 musical instrument a rattle
 post honour or supporter his peace stick or
cudgel
 canistercap hat
 firetrigger no beast prey can be more noxious to
society or destitute feeling than those who plunder the
unfortunate sufferers under that dreadful and destructive
calamity fire the tiger who leaps on the unguarded
passenger will fly from the fire and the traveller shall be
protected by it while these wretches who attend on fires
and rob the unfortunate sufferers under pretence 
coming to give assistance and assuming the style and manner
 neighbours take advantage distress and confusion
such wretches have a more eminent claim to the detestation
 society than almost any other those who prey upon it
 bundled took or conveyed
the feeble old scout shook his dripping wardrobe d d the
water and the booty kid that wallowed him into it but without appearing
to know which was him till bob stepped up and passing some silver into
his manley told him he hoped he was not hurt and our party then moved
on in the direction for russelstreet coventgarden when sparkle again
mentioned his wet condition and particularly recommended a glass 
cognac by way preventive from taking cold a good motion well made
said tom and here we are just by the harp where we can be fitted to
a shaving so come along
having taken this as sparkle observed very necessary precaution
they pursued their way towards piccadilly taking their route under the
piazzas coventgarden and thence up jamesstreet into longacre
where they were amused by a circumstance no very uncommon kind in
london but perfectly new to tallyhoho two charleys had in close custody
a sturdy young man who was surrounded by several others and was
taking him to the neighbouring watchhouse what is the matter said
tom
oh tis only a little bit a dead bodysnatcher said one the
guardians he has been up to the resurrection rig here continued
he i've got the bonebasket
 resurrection rig this subject though a grave one has
been treated by many with a degree comicality calculated
to excite considerable risibility a late well known
humorist has related the following anecdote
some young men who had been out upon the spree returning
home pretty well primed after drinking plentifully found
themselves so dry as they passed a public house where they
were well known they could not resist the desire they had
 calling on their old friend and taking a glass brandy
with him by way finish as they termed it and finding
the door open though it was late were tempted to walk in
but their old friend was out temper what is the
matter matter enough replied boniface here have i
got an old fool a fellow occupying my parlour dead drunk
and what the devil to do with him i don't know he can
neither walk nor speak
oh said one the party who knew that a resurrection
doctor resided in the next street i'll remove that
nuisance if that's all you have to complain only lend
me a sack and i'll sell him
a sack was produced and the bacchanalian who
almost appeared void animation was without much
difficulty thrust into it give me a lift said the
frolicsome blade and away he went with the load on
arriving at the doctor's door he pulled the night bell
when the assistant made his appearance not unaccustomed to
this sort nocturnal visitant
holding up a bag and it was taken off his shoulder as he went
along mercerstreet so he can't say nothing at all
i have brought you a subject all right
come in what is it a man or a woman
a man
down with him that corner d n it i was fast asleep
call for the sack in the morning will you for i want to get to bed
with all my heart
then going to a drawer and bringing the customary fee here said hebe
quick and be off this was exactly what the other wanted and having
secured the rubbish the door was shut upon him this however
was no sooner done than the booty kid in the sack feeling a sudden
internal turn the contents his stomach which brought with it a
heaving fell from the upright situation in which he had been placed
on the floor this so alarmed the young doctor that he ran with all
speed after the vender and just coming up to him at the corner the
street
why said he you have left me a living man
never mind replied the other kill him when you want him and
making good use his heels he quickly disappeared
a comedian some celebrity but who is now too old for theatrical
service relates a circumstance which occurred to him upon his first
arrival in town
having entered into an engagement to appear upon the boards one 
the london theatres he sought the metropolis some short time before the
opening the house and conceiving it necessary to his profession
to study life real life as it is he was accustomed to mingle
promiscuously in almost all society with this view he frequently
entered the tap rooms the lowest public houses to enjoy his pipe and
his pint keeping the main object always in view
to catch the manners living as they rise
calling one evening at one these houses not far from drury lane he
found some strapping fellows engaged in conversation interlarded with
much flash and low slang but decently dressed he mingled in a sort 
general dialogue with them on the state the weather politics c
after sitting some time in their company and particularly noticing
their persons and apparent character
come bill it is time to be off it is getting rather
darkish ah very well replied the other let us have
another quart and then i am your man for a bit a lark
by this time they had learned that the comedian was but
newly arrived in town and he on the other hand was desirous
 seeing what they meant to be up to after another quart
they were about to move when said one to the other as weare
only going to have a stroll and a bit fun perhaps
that there young man would like to join us
ah what say you sir have you any objection but perhaps
you have business on hand and are engaged 
no i have nothing particular to do was the reply very
well then if you like to go with us we shall be glad 
your company
well said he i don't care if i do spend an hour with
you and with that they sallied forth
after rambling about for some time in the vicinity 
tottenham court road shewing him some the squares c
describing the names streets squares and buildings
they approached st giles's and leading him under a
gateway stop said one we must call upon jack you know
for old acquaintance sake and gave a loud knock at the
door which being opened without a word they all walked in
and the door was instantly lock'd he was now introduced to
a man squalid appearance with whom they all shook hands
the mode introduction was not however so satisfactory
a description as had been expected being very laconic and
conveyed in the following language we have got him
yes yes it is all right come jack serve us out some
grog and then to business
the poor comedian in the mean time was left in the utmost
anxiety and surprise to form an opinion his situation
for as he had heard something about trepanning pressing
c he could not help entertaining serious suspicion that he
should either be compellet to serve as a soldier or a
sailor and as he had no intention to gain a name in arms
they were neither them suitable to his inclinations
come said one walk up stairs and sit down jack bring
the lush and up stairs they went
upon entering a gloomy room somewhat large with only a
small candle he had not much opportunity discovering
what sort a place it was though it looked wretched
enough the grog was brought here's all round the gravestone
said one come drink away my hearty don't be
alarm'd we are rum fellows and we'll put you up to a rigor
two we are got a rum covey in the corner there and you
must lend us a hand to get rid him then holding up the
light what was the surprise the poor comedian to espy a
dead body a man you can help us to get him away and
by g you shall too it's no use to flinch now
a circumstance this kind was new to him so that his
perplexity was only increased by the discovery but he
plainly perceived by the last declaration that having
engaged in the business it would be no use to leave it
half done he therefore remained silent upon the subject
drank his grog when jack came up stairs to say the cart was
ready
lend a hand said one them let us get our load downstairs
come my master turn to with a good heart all's
right
with this the body was conveyed down stairs
at the back the house was a small yard separated from a
neighbouring street by a wall a signal was given by someone
on the other side which was understood by those within
it was approaching nine o'clock and a dark night come
said one them mount you to the top the wall and
ding the covey over to the carcasscarter this being
complied with the dead body was handed up to him which was
no sooner done than the carman outside perceiving the
watchman approach it won't do said he and giving a
whistle drove his cart with an assumed air carelessness
away while the poor comedian who had a new character to
support in which he did not conceive himself well up
was holding the dead man on his lap with the legs projecting
over the wall it was a situation the utmost delicacy and
there was no time to recast the part he was therefore
obliged to blunder through it as well as he could the
perspiration the living man fell plentifully on the
features the dead as the charley approached in a position
to pass directly under him those inside had sought the
shelter the house telling him to remain quiet till the
old scout was gone by now although he was not fully
acquainted with the consequences discovery he was
willing and anxious to avoid them he therefore took the
advice and scarcely moved or breathed past nine o'clock
said the watchman as he passed under the legs the dead
body without looking up though he was within an inch 
having his castor brushed off by them being thus relieved
he was happy to see the cart return he handed over the
unpleasant burthen and as quick as possible afterwards
descended from his elevated situation into the street
determining at all hazards to see the result this to him
extraordinary adventure with this view he followed the cart
at a short distance keeping his eye upon it as he went
along and in one the streets leading to long acre he
perceived a man endeavouring to look into the back part 
the cart but was diverted from his object by one the men
who had introduced him to the house while another the
confederates snatched the body from the cart and ran withall
speed down another street in an opposite direction this
movement had attracted the notice the watchman who
being prompt in his movements had sprung his rattle upon
this and feeling himself too heavily laden to secure his
retreat the fellow with the dead man perceiving the gate 
an area open dropped his burden down the steps shamed the
gate after him and continued to fly but was stopped at the
 the street in the mean time the charley in pursuit
had knock'd at the door the house where the stolen goods
as he supposed were deposited
 a cant phrase for money
it was kept by an old maiden lady who upon discovering the
dead body a man upon her premises had fainted in the
watchman's arms the detection the running
resurrectionist was followed by a walk to the watchhouse
where his companions endeavoured to make it appear that they
had all been dining at wandsworth together that he was not
the person against whom the hue and cry had been raised but
old noose l said it wouldn't do and he was therefore
detained to appear before the magistrate in the morning the
comedian who had minutely watched their proceedings took
care to be at bowstreet in good time where he found upon
the affidavits two his comrades who swore they had
dined together at wandsworth their pal was liberated
 the constable the night
bob could not very well understand what was the meaning this
lingo he was perfectly at a loss to comprehend the terms peabody
snatching and the resurrection rig the crowd increased as they went
along and as they did not exactly relish their company sparkle led
them across the way and then proceeded to explain
why said sparkle the custom deadbody snatching has become
very common in london and in many cases appears to be winked at by the
magistrates for although it is considered a felony in law it is also
acknowledged in some degree to be necessary for the surgeons in
order to have an opportunity obtaining practical information it is
however at the same time a source no slight distress to the parents
and friends the parties who are dragg'd from the peaceful security 
the tomb the resurrectionmen are generally well rewarded for their
labours by the surgeons who employ them to procure subjects they are
for the most part fellows who never stick at trifles but make a decent
livelihood by moving off if they can not only the bodies but coffins
shrouds c and are always upon the lookout wherever there is a
funeral nay there have been instances in which the bodies have been
dug from their graves within a few hours after being deposited there
it is a shameful practice said bob and ought not to be tolerated
however nor can i conceive how with the apparent vigilance the
police it can be carried on
nothing more easy said sparkle where the plan is well laid these
fellows when they hear a passingbell toll skulk about the parish from
alehouse to alehouse till they can learn a proper account 
what the deceased died what condition the body is in c with which
account they go to a resurrection doctor who agrees for a price
which is mostly five guineas for the body a man and then bargain
with an undertaker for the shroud coffin c which perhaps with a
little alteration may serve to run through the whole family
and is it possible said bob that there are persons who will enter
into such bargains
no doubt it nay there was an instance a man really selling his
own body to a surgeon to be appropriated to his own purposes when dead
for a certain weekly sum secured to him while living but in robbing
the churchyards there are always many engaged in the rig for notice is
generally given that the body will be removed in the night to which the
sexton is made privy and receives the information with as much ease ashe
did to have it brought his price being a guinea for the use the
grubbing irons adjusting the grave c this system is generally
carried on in little country churchyards within a few miles london
a hackneycoach or a cart is ready to receive the stolen property and
there cannot be a doubt but many these depredations are attended with
success the parties escaping with their prey undetected nay i know
 an instance that occurred a short time back a young man who was
buried at wesley's chapel on which occasion one the mourners a
little more wary than the rest could not help observing two or three
rough fellows in the ground during the ceremony which aroused his
suspicion that they intended after interment to have the body his
departed friend this idea became so strongly rooted in his mind that
he imparted his suspicions to the remainder those who had followed
him himself and another therefore determined if possible to satisfy
themselves upon the point by returning in the dusk the evening to
reconnoitre they accordingly proceeded to the spot but the gates being
shut one them climbed to the top the wall where he discovered
the very parties he had before noticed in the act wrenching open
the coffin here they are said he hard at it as i expected but
before he and his friend could get over the wall the villains
effected their escape leaving behind them a capacious sack and all the
implements their infernal trade they secured the body had it
conveyed home again and in a few days reburied it in a place 
greater security
bob was surprised at this description the resurrectionrig but was
quickly drawn from his contemplation the depravity human nature
and what he could not help thinking the dirty employments life by
a shouting apparently from several voices as they passed the 
st martin's lane it came from about eight persons who appeared to be
journeymen mechanics with pipes in their mouths some them rather
meritorious who as they approached broke altogether into the
following
song
i'm a frolicsome young fellow i live at my ease
i work when i like and i play when i please
i'm frolicsome goodnatured i'm happy and free
and i care not a jot what the world thinks me
with my bottle and glass some hours i pass
sometimes with my friend and sometimes with my lass
i'm frolicsome goodnatur'd i'm happy and free
and i don't care one jot what the world thinks me
by the cares the nation i'll ne'er be perplex'd
i'm always goodnatur'd e'en though i am vex'd
i'm frolicsome goodhumour'd i'm happy and free
and i don't care one d n what the world thinks me
 a circumstance very similar to the one here narrated by
sparkle actually occurred and can be well authenticated
 meritorious noisy
 this song is not introduced for the elegance its
composition but as the author has actually heard it in the
streets at the flight night or the peep day sung in
full chorus as plain as the fumes the pipes and the
hiccups would allow the choristers at those hours to
articulate and as it is probably the effusion some
shipmate in unison with the sentiments many it forms
part real life deserving being recorded in this work
particular trades have particular songs suitable to the
employment in which they are engaged which while at work
the whole the parties will join in in spitalfields
bethnalgreen c principally inhabited by weavers it is
no uncommon thing to hear twenty or thirty girls singing
with their shuttles going the death barbary allen there
was an old astrologer mary's dream or death and the lady
and we remember a watchmaker who never objected to hear his
boys sing but although he was himself a loyal subject he
declared he could not bear god save the king and upon being
ask'd his reason why said he it is too slow for as the
time goes so the fingers move give us drops brandy 
or go to the devil and shake yourself then i shall have
some work done
this song which was repeated three or four times was continued
till their arrival at newportmarket where the songsters divided our
party pursued their way through coventrystreet and arrived without
further adventure or interruption safely at home sparkle bade them
adieu and proceeded to bondstreet and tom and bob sought the repose
 the pillow
it is said that music hath charms to sooth the savage breast and it
cannot but be allowed that the yo heave ho our sailors or the
sound a fiddle contribute much to the speed weighing anchor
it is an indisputable fact that there are few causes which more
decidedly form or at least there are few evidences which more clearly
indicate the true character a nation than its songs and ballads it
has been observed by the learned selden that you may see which way the
wind sets by throwing a straw up into the air when you cannot make the
same discovery by tossing up a stone or other weighty substance thus it
is with songs and ballads respecting the state public feeling when
productions a more elaborate nature fail in their elucidations so
much so that it is related a great statesman who was fully convinced
 the truth the observation that he said give me the making 
the national ballads and i care not who frames your laws every day's
experience tends to prove the power which the sphereborn sisters 
harmony voice and verse have over the human mind i would rather
says mr sheridan have written glover's song hosier's ghost than
the annals tacitus

o what a town what a wonderful metropolis
sure such a town as this was never seen
mayor common councilmen citizens and populace
wand'ring from poplar to burnham green

poets jews and gentlemen apothecaries mountebanks
there's bethlehem hospital and there the picture gallery
and there's sadler's wells and there the court chancery
o such a town such a wonderful metropolis
sure such a town as this was never seen
o such a town and such a heap carriages
sure such a motley group was never seen
such a swarm young and old burying and marriages
all the world seems occupied in ceaseless din
there's the bench and there's the bank now only take a peep at her
and there's rag fair and there the eastlondon theatre
there's st james's all so fine st giles's all in tatters
where fun and frolic dance the rig from saturday to saturday
o what a town what a wonderful metropolis
sure such a town as this was never seen
a short time after this day's ramble the hon tom dash all and his
friend tallyhoho paid a visit to the celebrated tattersall's
illustration page tattersall's
this said tom is a great scene action at times and you will
upon some occasions find as much business done here as there is on
change the dealings however are not so fair though the profits
are larger and if you observe the characters and the visages the
visitants it will be found it is most frequently attended by turfjews
and greeks any man indeed who dabbles in horsedealing must like
a gamester be either a rook or a pigeon for horsedealing is a
species gambling in which as many
 turfjews and greeks gamblers at races trottingmatches
c
 rooks and pigeons are frequenters gaminghouses the
former signifying the successful adventurer and the latter
the unfortunate dupe
depredations are committed upon the property the unwary as in
any other and every one engaged in it thinks it a meritorious act to
dupe his chapman even noblemen and gentlemen who in other
transactions life are honest will make no scruple cheating you in
horsedealing nor is this to be wondered at when we consider that
the lord and the baronet take lessons from their grooms jockeys or
coachmen and the nearer approach they can make to the appearance
and manners their tutors the fitter the pupils for turfmen or
gentlemen dealers for the school in which they learn is such
a description that dereliction principle is by no means
surprising fleecing each other is an everyday practice every one
looks upon his fellow as a bite and young men fashion learn how to
buy and sell from old whips jockeys or rum ostler whose practices
have put them up to every thing and by such ruffian preceptors are
frequently taught to make three quarters or seventyfive per cent
profit which is called turning an honest penny this though frequently
practised at country fairs c by horsejobbers c is here executed
with all the dexterity and art imaginable for instance you have
a distressed friend whom you know must sell you commiserate his
situation and very kindly find all manner faults with his horse and
buy it for half its value you also know a greenhorn and an extravagant
fellow to whom you sell it for twice its value and that is the neat
thing again if you have a horse you wish to dispose the same
school will afford you instruction how to make the most him that is
to say to conceal his vices and defects and by proper attention to put
him into condition to alter his whole appearance by hogging cropping
and docking by patching up his broken knees blowing gunpowder in his
dim eyes bishoping blistering c so as to turn him out in good twig
scarcely to be known by those who have frequently seen and noticed him
besides which at the time sale one these gentry will aid and
assist your views by pointing out his recommendations in some such
observations as the following
there's a horse truly good and well made
there's the appearance a fine woman broad breast round hips and
long neck
there's the countenance intrepidity and fire a lion
there's the eye joint and nostril an ox
there's the nose gentleness and patience a lamb
there's the strength constancy and foot a mule
there's the hair head and leg a deer
there's the throat neck and hearing a wolf
there's the ear brush and trot a fox
there's the memory sight and turning a serpent
there's the running suppleness and innocence the hare
and if a horse sold for sound wind limb and eyesight with all the
gentleness a lamb that a child might ride him with safety should
afterwards break the purchaser's neck the seller has nothing to do with
it provided he has received the bit but laughs at the do 
nay they will sometimes sell a horse warranted to go as steady as ever
a horse went in harness to a friend assuring him at the same time that
he has not a fault any kind that he is good as ever shoved a head
through a horsecollar and if he should afterwards rear up in the gig
and overturn the driver into a ditch shatter the concern to
pieces spill ma'am and kill both her and the child promise the
conscientious horsedealer has nothing to do with all this how could
he help it he sold the horse for a good horse and a good horse he was
this is all in the way fair dealing again if a horse is sold as
sound and he prove brokenwinded lame or otherwise not worth
one fortieth part the purchasemoney still it is only a piece 
jockeyship a fair manouvre affording opportunities merriment
a very laudable sort company said bob
it is rather a mixed one replied tom it is indeed a complete
mixture all conditions ranks and orders society but let us take
a peep at some them do you observe that stout fellow yonder with
a stick in his hand he has been a daisykicker and by his arts and
contrivances having saved a little money is now a regular dealer and
may generally be seen here on selling days
daisykicker said bob i don't comprehend the term
then i will explain was the reply daisytickets are ostler
belonging to large inns who are known to each other by that title and
you may frequently hear them
 bit a cant term for money
 do any successful endeavour to overreach another is by
these gentlemen call'd a do meaning so and so has been
done
ask when did you sell your daisykicker or grogram for these
terms are made use among themselves as cant for a horse do you also
observe he is now in close conversation with a person who he expects
will become a purchaser
and who is he
he is no other than a common informer though in high life keeps his
carriage horses and servants lives in the first style he is shortly
to be made a consul and perhaps an ambassador afterwards the first
is to all intents and purposes a lord trade and his excellency
nothing more than a titled spy in the same way as a bailiff is a
follower the law and a man out livery a knight's companion or a
nobleman's gentleman
their attention was at this moment attracted by the appearance two
persons dressed in the extreme fashion who upon meeting just by
them caught eagerly hold each other's hand and they overheard
the following why bill how am you my hearty where have you
been trotting your galloper what is you after how's harry and
ben haven't seen you this blue moon
all tidy was the reply ben is getting better and is going to sport
a new curricle which is now building for him in long acre as soon ashe
is recovered
why what the devil's the matter with him eh
nothing any consequence only he got milled a night or two ago about
his blown he had one his ribs broke sprained his right wrist and
sports a painted peeper upon the occasion that's all
why you know he's no bad cock at the fancy and won't put up with any
gammon
no but he was lusty and so he got queer but i say have you sold
your bay
no d n me i can't get my price
why what is it you axes
only a hundred and thirty got by agamemnon lord it's no price at
all cheap as dirt but i say bill
 blue moon this is usually intended to imply a long time
 painted peeper a black eye
 axes among the swell lads and those who affect the
characters knowing coveys there is a common practice 
endeavouring to coin new words and new modes expression
evidently intended to be thought wit and this affectation
frequently has the effect creating a laugh
how do you come on with your grey and the piebald poney
all right and regular my boy matched the poney for a light curricle
and i swapped the grey for an entire horse such a rum one when
will you come and take a peep at him all bone fine shape and action
figure beyond compare i made a rare good chop it
i'm glad to hear it i'll make a survey and take a ride with you the
first leisure day but i'm full business no time to spare i say
are you a dealer
no no it won't do i lost too much at the derby besides i must go
and drive my girl out avait that's the time day my boys so
good by but if you should be able to pick up a brace clever
pointers a prime spaniel or a greyhound to match smut i'm your
man buy for me and all's right price you know is out the
question i must have them if they are to be got so look out bid and
buy but mind nothing but prime will do for me that's the time day
you know d n me so good by i'm off and away he went
some great sporting character i suppose said bob plenty money
no such thing said tom drawing him on one side you will hardly
believe that bill is nothing more than a showman to a linendraper
recently discharged for mal practices and the other has been a waiter
at a tavern but is now out place and they are both upon the
sharp lookout to gammon the flats the former obtains his present
livelihood by gambling spends the most his time in playing cards
with greenhorns always to be picked up at low flash houses at fairs
races millingmatches c and is also in the holy keeping the
castoff mistress a nobleman whose family he was formerly in as a
valetdechambre the other pretends to teach sparring in the city
and occasionally has a benefit in the minores duke's place and the
fives court
they talk it well however said bob
 snapped exchanged
 that's the time day that's your sort that's the
barber keep moving what am you after what am you up to
there never was such times that's the dandy go along bob
c are expressions that are frequently made use by the
people the metropolis and indeed fashion seems almost to
have as much to do with our language as with our dress or
manners
words are but wind many a proud word comes off a weak stomach
was the reply and you may almost expect not to hear a word truth in
this place which may be termed the sporting repository it is the grand
mart for horses and for other fashionable animals for expensive asses
and all sorts sportingdogs townpuppies and secondhand
vehicles here bets are made for races and fights matches are made up
here bargains are struck and engagements entered into with as much
form regularity and importance as the progress parliamentary
proceedings points doubt upon all occasions jockeyship are
decided here and no man fashion can be received into what is termed
polished society without a knowledge this place and some the
visitors the proceedings however are generally so managed that the
ostler the jockeys the grooms and the dealers come best off from
a superiority knowledge and presumed judgment they have a method 
patching up deep matches to diddle the dupes and to introduce throws
over doubles double doubles to ease the heavy pockets their
burdens the system puffing is also as much in use here as among the
lotteryoffice keepers the quack doctors or the auctioneers and
the knowing ones by an understanding amongst each other sell their
cattle almost for what they please if it so happens they are not
immediately in want the ready which by the way is an article
too frequently in request and here honest poverty is often obliged to
sell at any rate while the rich blackleg takes care only to sell to
a good advantage making a point at the same time not only to make the
most his cattle but also his friend or acquaintance
liberal and patrioticminded men said bob it is a noble society
and well worthy cultivation
it is fashionable society at least continued tom and deserving 
observation for it is fraught with instruction
i think so indeed was the reply but i really begin to suspect that
i shall scarcely have confidence to venture out alone for there does
not appear to be any part your wonderful metropolis but what is
infested with some kind shark or other
it is but too true and it is therefore the more necessary to make
yourself acquainted with them it is rather a long lesson but really
deserving being learnt you
 the ready money
perceive what sort company you are now in as far as may be
judged from their appearances but they are not to be trusted for i
doubt not but you would form erroneous conclusions from such premises
the company that assembles here is generally composed a great variety
 characters the idler the swindler the dandy the exquisite the
fullpursed young peer the needy sharper the gaudy pauper and the
aspiring schoolboy anxious to be thought a dealer and a judge the
article before him looking at a horse with an air importance and
assumed intelligence bidding with a trembling voice and palpitating
heart lest it should be knock'd down to him do you see that dashing
fellow nearly opposite to us in the green frockcoat topboots and
spurs do you mark how he nourishes his whip and how familiar he seems
to be with the knowing old covey in brown
yes i suppose he is a dealer
you are right he is a dealer but it is in man's flesh not horseflesh
he is a bum trap in search some friend
 bum trap a term pretty generally in use to denominate a
bailiff or his follower they are also called bodysnatches
the ways and means made use by these gentry to
make their captions are innumerable they visit all places
assume all characters and try all stratagems to secure
their friends in order that they may have an opportunity 
obliging them which they have a happy facility in doing
provided the party can bleed free among others the
following are curious facts
a gentleman who laboured under some peculiar difficulties
found it desirable for the sake his health to retire into
the country where he secluded himself pretty closely from
the vigilant anxieties his friends who were in search 
him and had made several fruitless attempts to obtain an
interview the traps having ascertained the place his
retreat from which it appeared that nothing but stratagem
could draw him a knowing old snatch determined to effect
his purpose and succeeded in the following manner
one day as the gentleman came to his window he discovered a
man seemingly in great agitation passing and repassing
at length however he stopped suddenly and with a great
deal attention fixed his eyes upon a tree which stood
nearly opposite to the window in a few minutes he returned
to it pulled out a in which he read for a few
minutes and then drew forth a rope from his pocket with
which he suspended himself from the tree the gentleman
eager to save the life a fellowcreature ran out and cut
him down this was scarcely accomplished before he found
the man whom he had rescued as he thought from death
slapped him on the shoulder informed him that he was his
prisoner and in return robbed him his liberty
another these gentry assumed the character a poor
cripple and stationed himself as a beggar sweeping the
crossing near the habitation his shy cock who
conceiving himself safe after three days voluntary
imprisonment was seized by the supposed beggar who threw
away his broom to secure his man
yet notwithstanding the many artifices to which this
profession is obliged to conform itself it must be
acknowledged there are many them who have hearts that
would do honour to more exalted situations especially when
we reflect that in general whatever illiberality or
invective may be cast upon them they rarely if at all
oppress those who are in their custody and that they
frequently endeavour to compromise for the debtor or at
least recommend the creditor to accept those terms which
can be complied with
bleed free
or other with a writ in his pocket these fellows have some
protean qualities about them and as occasion requires assume all
shapes for the purpose taking care their customers they are
however a sort necessary evil the old one in brown is a wellknown
dealer a deep old file and knows every one around him he is up to the
sharps down upon the flats and not to be done but in looking round
you may perceive men booted and spurred who perhaps never crossed
a horse and some with whips in their hands who deserve it on their
backs they hum lively airs whistle and strut about with their
quizzingglasses in their hands playing a tattoo upon their boots and
shewing themselves off with as many airs as if they were real actors
engaged in the farce that is to say the buyers and sellers when in
truth they are nothing but loungers in search employment who
may perhaps have to count the trees in the park for a dinner without
satisfying the cravings nature dining as it is termed with duke
humphrey others perhaps who have arrived in safety are almost afraid
to venture into the streets again lest they should encounter those foes
to liberty john doe and richard roe
if i do may i be the remainder the sentence was lost by the
speaker removing in conversation with another when tom turn'd round
o said tom i thought i knew who it was that is one the greatest
reprobates in conversation that i ever met with
and who is he
why i'll give you a brief sketch him continued dashall it is
said and i fancy pretty well known that he has retired upon a
small property how acquired or accumulated i cannot say but he has
married a barmaid very beautiful features and elegant form having
been brought up to the bar she is not unaccustomed to confinement but
he has made her an absolute prisoner for he shuts her up as closely as
if she were in a monastery he never dines at home and she is left incomplete
solitude he thinks his game all safe but she has sometimes
escaped the vigilance her gaoler and has been seen at places distant
from home
 it is related this gentleman whose severity and
vigilance were so harshly spoken that one day at table
a dashing young military officer who while he was
circulating the bottle was boasting among his dissipated
friends his dexterity in conducting the wars venus
that he had a short time back met one the most lovely
creatures he ever saw in the king's road but he had
learned that her husband so strictly confined and watched
her that there was no possibility his being admitted to
her at any hour
behave handsome and i'll put you in possession a gun
that shall bring the game down in spite locks bolts and
bars or even the vigilance the eyes argus himself
how d me if i don't stand a ten pound note
how why easy enough i've a plan that cannot but succeed
down with the cash and i'll put you up to the scheme
no sooner said than done and he pocketed the ten pound
note
now said the hoary old sinner little suspecting that he
was to be the dupe his own artifice you get the husband
invited out to dinner have him well ply'd with wine by your
friends you assume the dress a postman give a
thundering rap at her door which always denotes either the
arrival some important visitor or official communication
and when you can see her flatter lie and swear that her
company is necessary to your existence that life is a
burden without her tell her you know her husband is
engaged and can't come that he is dining out with some
jolly lads and can't possibly be home for some hours fall
at her feet and say that having obtained the interview
you will not leave her your friends in the mean time must
be engaged in making him as drunk as a piper that's the way
to do it and if you execute it as well as it is plann'd
the day's your own
bravo bravo echoed from every one present
it was a high thing the breach thus made the hornwork was
soon to be carried and there could be no doubt a safe
lodgement in the covertway
the gay militaire met his inamorata shortly afterwards in
chelseafields and after obtaining from her sundry
particulars inquiry as to the name her husband c
he acquainted her with his plan the preliminaries were
agreed upon and it was determined that the maidservant
who was stationed as a spy upon her at all times should be
dispatched to some house in the neighbourhood to procure
change while the man letters was to be let in and
concealed and upon her return it was to be stated that the
postman was in a hurry could not wait and was to call
again this done he was to make his escape by a ropeladder
from the window as soon as the old one should be heard upon
the stairs which it course was presumed would be at a
late hour when he was drunk
the train having been thus laid old vigilance dined out
and expected to meet the colonel but being disappointed
and suspicious at all times for
suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind
the utmost endeavours the party to make him drunk proved
ineffectual he was restless and uncomfortable and he could
not help fancying by the visible efforts to do him up that
some mischief was brewing or some hoax was about to be
played off he had his masterkey in his pocket and retired
early
his lady whose plan had succeeded admirably at home was
fearful having the door bolted till after twelve lest
the servant's suspicions should be aroused in the inhabitants our
own sphere action and i trust we shall all become better known to
each other
this piece information appeared to be truly acceptable to all
parties young mortimer was a goodlooking and well made young man his
features were animated and intelligent his manners polished though
not quite so unrestrained as those which are to be acquired by an
acquaintance with metropolitan associations
i am happy said he to be introduced to any friends your's and
shall be proud to number them among mine
you may replied sparkle with great safety place them on your list
though you know i have already made it appear to you that friendship is
a term more generally made use than understood in london
for what is friendship but a name
a charm which lulls to sleep
a shade that follows wealth and fame
and leaves the wretch to weep
and love is still an emptier sound
the modern fair one's jest
on earth unseen or only found
to warm the turtle's nest
these sentiments are excellently expressed said tom pinching him by
the arm and i suppose in perfect consonance with your own
sparkle felt the rebuke look'd down and seem'd confused but in a
moment recovering himself
not exactly so replied he but then you know and i don't
mind confessing it among friends though you are aware it is very
unfashionable to acknowledge the existence any thing the kind i
am a pupil nature
you seem to be in a serious humour all at once said young mortimer
can't help it continued sparkle for
let them all say what they will
nature will be nature still
and that usurper or i should rather say would be usurper fashion
is in no way in alliance with our natures i remember the old duchess 
marlborough used to say that to love some persons very much and to
see often those we love is the greatest happiness i can enjoy but
it appears almost impossible for any person in london to secure such an
enjoyment and i can't help feeling it
by the look and manner with which this last sentiment was uttered tom
plainly discovered there was a something labouring at his heart which
prompted it moralizing said he ah charley you are a happy
fellow i never yet knew one who could so rapidly change from grave to
gay from lively to severe and for the benefit our friends i can't
help thinking you could further elucidate the very subject you have so
feelingly introduced
you are a quiz said sparkle but there is one thing to be said
i know you and have no great objection to your hits now and then
provided they are not knock down blows
but said mortimer what has this to do with friendship and love i
thought you were going to give something like a london definition the
terms
why said sparkle in london it is equally difficult to get to love
any body very much or often to meet those that we love there are such
numbers acquaintances such a constant succession engagements 
one sort or other such a round delights that the town resembles
vauxhall where the nearest and dearest friends may walk round and round
all night without once meeting for instance at dinner you should see a
person whose manners and conversation are agreeable and pleasing to you
you may wish in vain to become more intimate for the chance is that
you will not meet so as to converse a second time for many months
for no one can tell when the dicebox society may turn up the same
numbers again i do not mean to infer that you may not barely see the
same features again it is possible that you may catch a glimpse them
on the opposite side pall mall or bondstreet or see them near
to you at a crowded rout without a possibility approaching
it is from this cause that those who live in london are so totally
indifferent to each other the waves follow so quick that every vacancy
is immediately filled up and the want is not perceived the wellbred
civility modern times and the example some very popular people
it is true have introduced a shaking hands a pretended warmth a
dissembled cordiality into the manners the cold and warm alike
the dear friend and the acquaintance yesterday consequently we
continually hear such conversation as the following ah how d'ye do
i'm delighted to see you how is mrs m 
she's very well thank you has she any increase in family any
increase why i've only been married three months i see you are talking
 my former wife bless you she has been dead these three years or
ah my dear friend how d'ye do you have been out town some time
where have you been in norfolk no i have been two years in india
this description a friendly salutation appeared to interest and
amuse both talltho and mortimer tom laughed shrugged up his shoulders
acknowledged the picture was too true and sparkle continued
and thus it is that ignorant one another's interests and
occupations the generality friendships london contain nothing
more tender than a visiting card nor are they much better indeed they
are much worse if you renounce the world and determine to live only
with your relations and nearest connexions for if you go to see them
at one o'clock they are not stirring at two the room is full 
different acquaintances who talk over the occurrences the last
night's ball and course are paid more attention to than yourself
at three they are out shopping at four they are in this place dashing
among the pinks from which they do not return till seven then they are
dressing at eight they are dining with two dozen friends at nine and
ten the same at eleven they are dressing for the ball and at twelve
when you are retiring to rest they are gone into society for the
evening so that you are left in solitude you soon begin again to try
the world and we will endeavour to discover what it produces
the first inconvenience a london life is the late hour a
fashionable dinner to pass the day in fasting and then sit down to a
great dinner at eight o'clock is entirely against the first dictates 
common sense and common stomachs but what is to be done he who rails
against the fashion the times will be considered a most unfashionable
dog and perhaps i have already said more than sufficient to entitle me
to that appellation
don't turn king's evidence against yourself said tom for if you
plead guilty in this happy country you must be tried by your peers
nay said mortimer while fashion and reason appear to be in such
direct opposition to each other i must confess their merits deserve
to be impartially tried though i cannot for one moment doubt but the
latter must ultimately prevail with the generality however her dictates
may be disregarded by the votaries the former
you are a good one at a ramble said tom and not a bad one in a
spree but i cannot help thinking you are rambling out your road
you seem to have lost the thread your subject and having been
disappointed with love and friendship you are just going to sit down to
dinner
pardon me replied sparkle i was proceeding naturally and not
fashionably to my subject but i know you are so great an admirer 
the latter that you care but little about the former
hit for hit said tom but go on you are certainly growing old
sparkle at all events you appear very grave this morning and if
you continue in this humour long i shall expect you are about taking
orders
there is a time for all things but the time for that has not yet
arrived
well then proceed without sermonizing
i don't like to be interrupted replied sparkle and there is yet
much to be said on the subject i find there are many difficulties
to encounter in contending with sin
by this time they were at the gate where finding the curricle and the
nags all in readiness sparkle and mortimer were soon horsed and tom
and bob seated in the curricle they proceeded to richmond taking
surveys the scenery on the road and discoursing on the usual topics
 such a journey which being foreign to the professed intention 
this work are omitted suffice it to say they returned refreshed from
the excursion and parted with a promise to meet again at nine o'clock
in grosvenor square
egad said dashall as they entered the diningroom there is
something very mysterious in all this sparkle has hitherto been the
life and soul society he seems to be deeply smitten with this young
lady miss mortimer and promises fairly by his manner to prove a
deserter from our standard and to inlist under the banners hymen
not unlikely replied tallyhoho if what we are told be true that it
is what we must all come to
be that as it may it ought not to interfere with our pursuits real
life in london though to be sure the ladies dear creatures ought
not to be forgotten they are so nearly and dearly interwoven with our
existence that without them life would be insupportable
after dinner they prepared for the evening party and made their
appearance in grosvenor squire at the appointed hour but as this will
introduce new characters to the reader we shall defer our account 
them till the next chapter
chapter xiv
ye are stars the night ye are gems the morn
ye are dewdrops whose lustre illumines the thorn
and rayless that night is that morning unblest
when no beam in your eye lights up peace in the breast
and the sharp thorn sorrow sinks deep in the heart
till the sweet lip woman assuages the smart
tis her's o'er the couch misfortune to bend
in fondness a lover in firmness a friend
and prosperity's hour be it ever confest
from woman receives both refinement and zest
and adorn'd by the bays or entreated with the willow
her smile is our meed and her bosom our pillow
arrived at grosvenor square they found the party consisted colonel
b his son and daughter miss mortimer and her brother mr
sparkle mr merrywell and lady lovelace the first salutations 
introduction being over there was time to observe the company among
whom miss mortimer appeared to be the principal magnet attraction
the old colonel was proud to see the friends mr sparkle and had
previously given a hearty welcome to mr merrywell as the friend his
nephew the young mortimer sparkle now appeared the gayest the gay
and had been amusing the company with some his liveliest descriptions
 character and manners that are to be witnessed in the metropolis
while merrywell who did not seem to be pleased with the particular
attentions he paid to miss mortimer was in close conversation with her
brother
tom could not but acknowledge that it was scarcely possible to see miss
mortimer without feelings a nature which he had scarcely experienced
before the elegant neatness her dress was calculated to display the
beauty her form and the vivid flashes a dark eye were so
many irresistible attacks upon the heart a sweet voice and smiling
countenance appeared to throw a radiance around the room and
illuminate the visages the whole party while lady lovelace
and maria b served as a contrast to heighten that effect which
they envied and reproved while tea was preparing after which it was
proposed to take a rubber at cards a sort general conversation took
place the preparations for the coronation the new novels the day
and the amusements the theatre were canvassed in turn and speaking
 the writings sir walter scott as the presumed author the
celebrated scotch novels lady lovelace declared she found it impossible
to procure the last published from the library notwithstanding her name
has been long on the list so much was it in request
sparkle replied that he had purchased the novel and would willingly
lend it to the ladies as for the libraries continued he they are
good places accommodation but it is impossible to please every one
either there or any where else they are however very amusing at times
and as a proof it i strolled the other morning to a circulating
library for the express purpose lounging away an hour in digesting
the politics and news the day but the curious scenes to which i
was witness during this short period so distracted my attention that
despite the grave subjects on which i was meditating i could not
resist lending an attentive ear to all that passed around me there was
something originality in the countenance the master the library
which struck me forcibly and the whimsical answers which he made to his
numerous subscribers and the yet more whimsical tone in which they
were pronounced more than once provoked a smile the first person
who attracted my notice was a fine showy looking woman dressed in
the extreme fashion with a bloom upon her cheek which might have
emulated that the rose with this exception that it wanted the charm
 nature putting a list into the hands the bookseller she
inquired if he had any the productions the names which were
there transcribed glancing his eye over the paper he replied with
an archness which not a little disconcerted her and which probably
occasioned her abrupt disappearance the fine lady madam is seldom
or ever at home but family secrets we are always ready to let out
characters eminent men growled out a little vulgar consequential
citizen whose countenance bore the stamp that insufferable
dulness that might almost tempt one to imagine him incapable 
comprehending the meaning the words which he pronounced with an air
 so much selfimportance characters eminent men repeated
the snarler in the same tone i much fear if we can boast a quarter
 that number eh mr margin i fear not sir replied margin
but such as we have are very much at your service better be in the
service the nation than in mine by far said the little purseproud
gentleman shrugging his shoulders very significantly shall i send
it for you sir said margin without noticing the last remark by no
means by no means the volume is not so large it won't encumber me
much i believe i shall find it small enough to put in my pocket
pursued the little great man grinning at the shrewdness his own
observations and stalking out with as much selfcomplacency as he had
stalked in i knew the man well and could not help laughing at the
lofty airs he assumed at the manner in which he affected to decry all
his countrymen without mercy at his unwillingness to acknowledge
any talent amongst them though he himself was a man that plodding
description who neither ever had done nor ever could do any thing to
entitle him to claim distinction any sort the young coxcomb who next
entered was a direct contrast to the last applicant both in person and
manner approaching with a fashionable contortion he stretched out his
ladylike hand and in the most languid and affected tone imaginable
inquired for the idler that sir said margin is amongst the works
we have unhappily lost but you will be sure to meet with it at any 
the fashionable libraries in the neighbourhood bond street or st
james's the young fop had just sense enough to perceive that the shaft
was aimed at him but not enough to relish the joke or correct the
follies which provoked it and turned abruptly on his heel he was met
at the door by a sentimental boardingschool miss who came flying into
the shop in defiance her governess and inquired in a very pathetic
tone for the constant lover that i am afraid said margin is
not amongst our collection dear me lisped the young lady with an
air chagrin that's very provoking i thought that was what everyone
had give me leave to assure you ma'am that you are quite
mistaken i fancy you will find that it is not to be met with all over
london
an old gentleman the old school whose clothes were decidedly
the cut the last century and whose stiff and formal manners were
precisely the same date with his habiliments next came hobbling
in poring through his spectacles over the catalogue which lay upon the
counter the first thing which caught his eye was an essay upon old
maids tom tom said the complaisant librarian calling to a lad at
the other the shop reach down the old maids for the gentleman
they won't appear to advantage i'm afraid a little dusty or damaged
with having laid so long upon the shelf he added with a simper which
was not lost upon any one present a melancholy looking man in whose
countenance meekness and insipidity were alike plainly depicted
now came forward inquiring in an under and what might almost be
designated an alarmed tone voice for the impertinent wife a
female who hung upon his arm interrupted him by entreating or rather
insisting in no very gentle tone that he would ask for something
better worth having margin affecting only to hear the former speaker
immediately produced the in question and observed with much
naivete that the impertinent wife was sure to be in the way at all
hours at the same time not omitting to recommend discipline as a
better work a young man whom i knew to be one the greatest fortune
hunters about town with an air consummate assurance put out
his hand for disinterested marriage that's a thing quite out 
date never thought now sir said margin who knew him as well as
myself allow me to recommend something more recent date something
more sought after in the fashionable world splendid misery sir
or the young man heard no more spite his impudence he was so
abashed by the reply that he made a hasty retreat the last person whom
i thought it worth my while to notice was a tall meagre looking man
whom i recollected to have seen pointed out to me as a wit and a genius
 the first order his wit was however that dangerous sort which
caused his company to be rather shunned than courted and it was very
evident from his appearance that he had not had the wit to work
himself into the good graces those who might have had it in their
power to befriend him though he spoke in a very low tone i soon
found that he was inquiring for plain sense on margin's replying
with much nonchalance that plain sense had late become very
rare finding himself disappointed in his first application his next
aim was patronage that sir said the wary bookseller is so much
sought after that i really cannot promise it to you at present but if
as i conclude you merely want something to beguile a leisure hour or
two probably the discontented man will answer the purpose very well
to this description sparkle the whole company listened with
attention and delight frequently interrupting him with bursts 
laughter tea was handed round and then cards introduced young
mortimer and merrywell seemed to take but little interest in the play
and evidently discovered their anxiety to be liberated having some
other object in view mortimer felt no great portion pleasure in
passing his time with his uncle the colonel nor with his sister lady
lovelace who was a perfect model london affectation besides his
friend mr merrywell who was to him what tom dashall and sparkle had
been to tallyhoho had made an engagement to introduce him to some 
his dashing acquaintances in the west nods and winks were interchanged
between them and could not but be noticed by tom and bob though
sparkle was so intent upon the amusements the moment and the company
 the lovely caroline as to appear immoveable
mr merrywell at length stated that he must be compelled to quit the
party young mortimer also apologized for as he and his friend were
engaged for an early excursion in the morning he should take a bed at
his habitation in order to be fully prepared this was the first step
to breaking up the party
merrywell called sparkle on one side saying he had something 
importance to communicate it was twelve o'clock and the gentlemen
after taking a formal leave the ladies and the colonel and a promise
on the part sparkle to meet them again the next morning at twelve to
escort them to the exhibition left the house
i am really happy said merrywell to sparkle as they passed the
door to have had the honour this introduction and shall have much
pleasure in becoming better acquainted with mr sparkle who though
personally unknown to me his name and fame are familiar
mr mortimer and myself are going to take a review the
neighbourhood st james's probably to shake an elbow
excellent said tom here is a fine opportunity for mr tallyhoho to
take a like survey and if agreeable we will join the party though
i am by no means a friend to gaming i conceive it necessary that every
person should see the haunts its votaries and the arts they make use
 in order to avoid them
you are right and therefore let us have a peep at them with this
they walk'd on listening with attention to the following lines which
were recited by sparkle
behold yon group fast fix'd at break day
whose haggard looks a sleepless night betray
with stern attention silent and profound
the mystic table closely they surround
their eager eyes with eager motions join
as men who meditate some vast design
sure these are statesmen met for public good
for some among them boast noble blood
or are they traitors holding close debate
on desp'rate means to overthrow the state
for there are men among them whose domains
and goods and chattels lie within their brains
no these are students the blackest art
that can corrupt the morals or the heart
yet are they oft in fashion's ranks preferred
and men honour if you take their word
but they can plunder pillage and devour
more than poor robbers at the midnight hour
lay deeper schemes to manage lucky hits
than artful swindlers living by their wits
like cunning fowlers spread th alluring snare
and glory when they pluck a pigeon bare
these are our gamesters who have basely made
the cards and dice their study and their trade
 gaming is generally understood to have been invented by
the lydian when they were under the pressure a great
famine to divert themselves from dwelling on their
sufferings they contrived the balls tables c and in
order to bear their calamity the better were accustomed to
play for the whole day together without interruption that
they might not be rack'd with the thought food which
they could not obtain it is not a little extraordinary that
this invention which was originally intended as a remedy
for hunger is now a very common cause that very evil
true said merry well as sparkle concluded though he did not
like the satire upon his own favourite pursuit those delineations are
correct and the versification good as far as it applies to the worst
species the gaminghouse
o said tom then pray sir which is the worst
nonsense said sparkle there is neither worse nor best these hells
are all alike sharks greeks gamblers knowing ones blacklegs and
decanters are to be met with at them all and they meet to bite one
another's heads off 
an admirable description truly the company you are about to
introduce us to gentlemen said tallyhoho
i don't understand greeks hells and blacklegs said mortimer and
should like an explanation
with all my heart replied sparkle hell is the general title now
given to any wellknown gaminghouse and really appears to be well
chosen for all the miseries that can fall to the lot human nature
are to be found in those receptacles idleness duplicity and
villany gaming is an estate to which all the world has a pretence
though few espouse it who are willing to secure either their estates
or reputations and these hells may fairly be considered as so many
halfway houses to the fleet or king's bench prisons or some more
desperate the love play is the most incurable insanities
robbery suicide and the extensive ruin whole families have been
known to proceed from this unfortunate and fatal propensity
greeks gamblers knowing ones and blacklegs are synonymous terms
applied to the frequenters the modern hells or gaminghouses
and may be distinguished from the rest society by the following
peculiarities in pursuits and manners
the greeks the present day though they may not lay claim to or
boast all the attributes the greeks antiquity must certainly
be allowed to possess that quality for which the latter were ever so
celebrated namely cunning and wariness for although no modern greek
can be said to have any resemblance to achilles ajax patroclus or
nestor in point courage strength fidelity or wisdom he may
nevertheless boast being a close copier the equally renowned
chief ithaca you will find him in most societies habited like a
gentleman his clothes are the newest fashion and his manners
 the highest polish with every appearance candour and honour
while he subsists by unfair play at dice cards and billiards
deceiving and defrauding all those with whom he may engage disregarding
the professions friendship and intimacy which are continually
falling from his lips
to become a good greek which by the way is a contradiction it
will be found necessary to follow these instructions
in the first place lie should be able to command his temper he should
speak but little and when he does mingle in conversation he should
most decidedly deprecate play as a source the greatest evil that
can prey upon society and elucidate its tendencies by striking examples
which are well known to himself and which are so forcibly impressed
upon his recollection that he is determined never to play deep again
but has no objection to a sociable and friendly game now and then just
to pass the time away a little agreeably by this means he may readily
mark down his man and the game once in view he should not appear too
eager in the pursuit it but take good care as the proverb says
to give a sprat in order to catch a herring this should be done by
allowing some temporary success before he make a final hit
there is perhaps no art which requires so much continual practice as
that greeley it is therefore necessary that the professor should
frequently exercise himself in private with cards and dice in order
that his digits may be trained to a proper degree agility upon which
the success his art principally depends he should also be accustomed
to work with some younger man than himself who having once been
a pigeon is become a nate that is enlightened and will not
peach consequently he serves as an excellent decoy to others
to ascertain the property the pigeon he intends to pluck is another
essential requisite and when this important information is obtained
which should be before he commences operations he should affect the
utmost liberality as to time c and make a show extending every
honourable facility to his opponent even by offers pecuniary
assistance by which means if he should be fortunate enough to have
it accepted he may probably by good management obtain a legal
security from him and thus be enabled to fasten on his prey
whenever he pleases
the title a military man such as captain is very useful to the
greek as it introduces him well to society and if he has once held a
commission in the army so much the better if not it can be assumed
so that if any unpleasant regimental peculation should be introduced
he may place his hand on the left side his breast declare he is
astonished and alarmed at the calumnious spirit the times shake his
head and interlard his conversation with commonplace ejaculations
such as the following indeed no why i know harry very well he's a
bit a blood can it be possible i should not have thought it bless
my heart exactly so good god a devilish good joke tho that's very
true says i so says he c c
a greek should be a man some personal courage never shrink from
a row nor be afraid to fight a duel he should be able to bully
bluster swagger and swear as occasion may require nay in desperate
cases such us peaching c he should not object even to assassination
he should invite large parties to dine with him frequently and have a
particular sort wine for particular companies he should likewise be
able to swallow a tolerable quantity the juice the grape himself
as well as know how to appear as if he were drinking when he is merely
passing the bottle and so manage it passing as to seem drunk at proper
times when good opportunities present themselves for the exercise
 his art and when a hit is really to be made he should positively
refuse to suffer play any kind in his house alleging that he has
seen enough it and cut the concern this serves to increase the
desire for it in others on any decisive occasion when a train is known
to be well laid he should appear to be drunk before any one the
party in which case he should take care beforehand to instruct his
decoy to pluck the pigeon while he as a supposed observer is betting
with some one in the company course an accomplice and is also a
loser
greeks who know each other are enabled to convey information by means
 private signals without uttering a word and consequently without
detection at whist or other games on the cards fingers are admirable
conveyancers intelligence and by dexterous performers are
so managed as to defy the closest scrutiny so as to have the natural
appearance pliancy while among the knowing ones their movements
are actually deciding the fate a rubber
egad said mortimer you seem to understand the business so well i
wonder you don't open shop
my knowledge continued sparkle is but theoretical i cannot boast
 much practical information for it is long since i shook the lucky
castor
o then you are discontented because you have no luck
not so said sparkle for i never play very deep so that win or
lose i can never suffer much but i am willing to give information to
others and with that view i have detailed the nature the houses
and the general character their frequenters according to my own
conception them the levanter is a blackleg who lives by the
broads l and the turf and is accustomed to work as it were by
telegraph with his pal and if you take the broads in hand in their
company you are sure to be work'd either by glazing that is putting
you in the front a lookingglass by which means your hand is
discovered by your antagonist or by private signals from the pal on
the turf he will pick up some nobleman or gentleman who he knows is
not up to the rig bet him fifty or a hundred on a horse pull out his
pocketbook set down the name and promise to be at the stand when
the race is over but takes care to be seen no more unless he is
the winner no 
street and both live in prime style the former in his
youth was an errand boy and he became so willing in doing
little jobs that his employers have paid him most
handsomely the latter gentleman who may be seen frequently
driving a bennet and looking both sides the road at
once is a chip the old block but as it is not our
intention to visit the sins the sou upon the father we
shall not enter into a minute examination him
no in burystreet is only about a year's standing
this table was set up by a broken adventurer capt b 
with mr a jeweller and a man whose agents keep a
house ill fame no way inferior in attribute to his
house in burystreet they commenced with narrow funds
and now thank the gulls are independent
the next door no is held by m g a mapseller
living at charing cross carl s formerly an understrapper
at ben t's living at king's road chelsea h ll
a tallowchandler living at no burystreet and
his brother a bricklayer residing somewhere off grosvenor
place these fellows have carried on their depredations for
some time but now have closed for awhile being one the
houses against whom a jew named portugal john and another
named the young black diamond have commenced proceedings
for sums had and received and by indictment
no in the same street is the property one o
d formerly a menial servant and not long ago a porter to
b l
these examples shew by incontestible inference that the
keepers those tables have an advantage which renders
their success certain while it fleeces the men who attend
them we always have seen these proprietors in the same
unchangeable affluence driving their equipages keeping
their country houses c c while those who play
invariably sink into poverty it has been often very often
remarked that young men who commence this career folly
and vice by degrees lose that freshness and fashionable
appearance which they at first possessed and at last are
seen wandering about st james's park counting the trees 
and dining on a gravel hash for want more genial fare
in a threadbare coat halfpolished boots a greasy hat and
a dirty cravat while the plunderers their happiness and
property are driving by them in luxury enjoying their
pleasure by contrast with their victim and sneering at his
miseries
 all the vices which deform this metropolis and there are
not a few the most ruinous is that rouge et noir
gambling for that is practised in the day time and it is a
matter astonishment to think that it has remained
undisturbed by the law and hitherto unnoticed by the press
at this moment no less than twelve these hells are open
to the public in the noonday and no less than five or six
profane the sabbath by their sinful practices although
london has been time out mind infested with the imps 
play yet it was not until within these last ten or fifteen
years that they dared open their dens to the honest light 
day about that period or a very short time before rouge
et noir was imported amongst other fashionable things from
france and to this game we are indebted for the practice 
gambling in the daylight
it is impossible to put down the vice gaming wholly and
not all the various enactments the legislature against it
have succeeded but that the ruinous and infamous practice
 indulging that vice in the midst crowded day should be
suffered for upwards sixteen years in the centre 
british society when it can easily be suppressed calls
forth our wonder and gives a stronger proof to us that our
societies for the suppression vice c c are shadows
with a name when the hazard tables open it is at an hour
when the respectable and controlled youths london are
within the walls their homes few are abroad except the
modern man ton the rake the sot the robber and the
vagabond and the dangers gaming on these orders 
society is little indeed when compared with the baneful
effects that vice upon the mercantile youth london it
is to this class and to the youth the middling orders 
society that gaming is destructive and it is upon these
that the rouge et noir tables cast the most fatal influence
young men this order cannot in general be absent from
their families after midnight the hour when the nocturnal
hells formerly yawned upon their victims but now the
introduction rouge et noir has rendered the abominable
track play a morning and evening's lounge set forth in
all the false glare which the artful proprietors can invent
to deceive the thoughtless and thus it affords
opportunities and temptations to such youth almost
irresistible
when the glittering london pleasures first meets the eye
 a young man placed upon the road a mercantile life or
when he enters any the multifarious departments in the
machine society which always lead the industrious and
prudent to honourable emolument he too frequently
misconceives the fashionable gamester's character and
confounds his crimes with elegant accomplishments the road
to pleasure is broad and the gates these hells are open
to him at hours when he can be absent and can indulge his
whim without suspicion for at first he looks upon his new
enjoyment but a mere whim which he can abandon at any
moment but how different is the proof he goes on his new
made wings carry him through a region delight and he
believes himself to possess the powers the eagle still
lighter he ascends and the solid earth on which he formerly
trod in safety recedes immeasurably from his giddy eye at
length his wings prove wax they melt before the sun and
the victim his own folly tumbles into the abyss 
destruction
it is no uncommon thing nay we will positively declare it
to be a very frequent practice these misled young men
when they have been initiated and have the temporary
command money belonging to their employers to go to the
rouge et noir tables armed as they think with
impenetrable armour a large sum and in the hope 
profiting to a certain amount risk that property the loss
 which would be the loss every thing dear to them in
society they believe from the greatness the amount they
possess that they can command a small gain and not for a
moment doubt they will be able to replace or return the
money entrusted to their care but little do they know the
fickleness luck and less do they suspect the odds and
imposing roguery arrayed against them their first loss is
trifling but they have to win that back iu addition to
their expected profits for this purpose they stake a larger
sum which if they lose increases their task and so on
until the halffrantic victims see no hope but desperation
and their remaining stock is placed upon the chance a
single card the event closes and the man who yesterday
enjoyed the good opinion the world and the esteem and
confidence his friends today becomes the veriest
outcast society these are common cases one which
for example we will describe as the facts occurred in the
year a clerk possessing the highest reputation
became a frequenter a rouge et noir table from the
nature his employment he had daily the command large
sums which for a short time he risked at play
successfully one day however he brought with him his
employer's money to the amount l the whole 
which in two days he lost we may judge the unhappy
young man's feelings by his subsequent conduct he wrote a
confession the affair to the man he wronged retired to a
tavern and blew his brains out
these gamingtables open at halfpast twelve o'clock
continue their orgies until five and recommence at seven in
the evening how many young men are passing their doors at
these hours with the property others in their pockets
and what a temptation to risk it it would seem as if these
places were set up as shops designed chiefly for the
accommodation midday dealers in illfortune as if
levelled directly at those men who cannot or will not spend
their nights in gambling and how the proprietors contrive
to escape detection and punishment is surprising
considering that the law affords ample means to put them
down
they know their customers and place themselves here to watch the
progress their gains their attentions are always directed to the
newcomers remorseless avaricious and happy unmarked with the lines
 care which contract and deform the faces their victims they
smile and smile and murder while they smile they will explain
the fairness the game and tell you the great losses they have
sustained but as this is no place for explanation we must look on and
say nothing
by this time merrywell and mortimer were mingled in the throng at the
table sparkle was engaged in conversation with an old acquaintance a
profusion money was flying about and a large heap or bank was placed
in the centre all was anxiety and for a few moments no sound was
heard but the awful numbers the eventful dealer every countenance
was hushed in expectation and every eye was fixed upon the coming card
which should decide the fate hundreds it was an awful moment to
every one engaged in the play but the pause was succeeded with a sort
 harlequinade movement to a scene confusion and uproar scarcely to
be conceived
the appearance at the door half a dozen persons armed with pistols
rushing past the guardians and bearing away all before them had
such an instantaneous effect upon the company that they all arose
as it were to receive them and the leader the party threw himself
suddenly upon the pile banknotes in the centre the table with
intent to seize the whole bank
confusion and dismay were now visibly depicted on every countenance for
some actuated by desperation at the prospect ruin and others by the
urgings avarice determined to have a scramble for the notes which
they commenced most furiously each one securing as much as he could to
himself there was tumbling and tossing and pulling and shoving mouths
stuffed with hundreds hundreds mouths that were supperless and
likely to continue so unless they could now make sure something
bank paper was literally going for nothing however the pistols being
the most powerful the armed forces succeeded in seizing the greatest
share the stock and a negative sort silence was at length
restored the party was materially decreased for seeing they were
betrayed every one after an endeavour to secure a share the spoil
deemed it necessary to make good his retreat and among the rest
our party who had not interfered with the play or assisted in the
entertainment soon found themselves in the street
egad said sparkle i think we are in luck to escape so easily
we might have been compelled to make our appearance at bow street
tomorrow an occurrence i would studiously avoid
well done old steady said tom it is not long you know since you
was there after a night's lodging in the neighbourhood
that was under very different circumstances continued sparkle in
defence a woman i would risk my life at any time but i would by
no means incur the imputation being a gambler it is a character i
abhor i have before said i would never venture into those dens again
to herd with swindlers all descriptions
they all seem gay fellows too said bob
yes replied sparkle but the character and conduct a young man
has ere now been altered in one night the evil effects produced by
initiation to those hells are incalculable
moralizing at midnight said tom an excellent title for a volume
sparkling contemplations
to be written by the hon tom dashall or the merry devil 
piccadilly was the reply
huzza said merrywell if this is the case our time will not be lost
in this excursion did you hear that lord has been compelled to put
down his establishment in consequence his losses at play pray don't
forget to mention that in the work
tis no new thing continued sparkle for lords the present day
since i believe there are few the nobility who are not either greeks
or pigeons indeed the list visitors to these places contains names
 many persons who should set better examples to the humbler classes 
the community for the unfortunate results this too fatal propensity
to parents and society have been severely felt among many instances
on record a very interesting one is related a young subaltern in a
regiment cavalry who by successive losses was reduced to such a
state distress as to form the desperate resolution trying the
road in a moment agony he accidentally met with an opportunity
which seemed to favour his design having learned that a certain
baronet recently returned from india with abundance wealth had laid
it out on landed estates in england and that he would on a certain day
cross the country with a large sum money after collecting his rents
he laid his plan for a meeting on a retired spot and succeeded in
stopping the carriage your money or your life said he presenting
his pistol with a trembling hand the baronet perceiving there was a
sort gentlemanly air about him which indicated something more than
might be calculated on in the character a highwayman presented him
with his purse a watch and a valuable diamond ring remarking he
could not help conceiving that he was unaccustomed to the trade and
that it was most desirable he should abandon it for ever the
young officer though considerably confused and embarrassed by this
observation was not to be disappointed his booty returned this
property and demanded the larger sum which for safety had been
concealed in the bottom the carriage the manner however in which
this was done only served to confirm the suspicions the baronet
which he could not help expressing as he acknowledged the accuracy 
the highwayman's information and produced the property observing he
was sure that circumstances no common kind could have impelled
him to this flagrant breach the laws he asked as a favour that he
would grant him an interview at some future period pledging his honour
that he should have no occasion to repent such a singular mark 
confidence
the officer replied that he had and he felt he could with safety
trust both his life and his honour in the veracity sir and
appointed a meeting at the london coffee house lydgate hill only
stipulating that at such meeting both parties were to be unattended
as the day meeting approached the baronet thought seriously the
solicited rencontre and after enjoining perfect secresy on the part 
his friend col entreated him to be his companion the colonel
laughed at the idea that any man who had robbed another should so
indiscreetly place his life in his hands had no conception his
keeping his appointment and solemnly assured the baronet that he would
in no case divulge who or what he was that he might become acquainted
with
the colonel ridiculed his friend's credulity as they entered the house
and were shewn to a private room the appointed hour was eight in the
evening and as the clock st paul's struck a gentleman inquiring
for sir was shewn into the room wine was ordered and for an hour
a general conversation on the popular topics the day ensued when the
gentleman evidently under deeply impressed feelings embarrassment
and disappointment in which the colonel seemed to partake arose and
politely took his leave
 well said the baronet what think you my highwayman now am i
not right is he not a gentleman
 and this is the robber is it sir said the colonel be assured
he shall swing for it why sir i know him well he is a in my own
regiment
hold said the baronet don't be rash remember the solemn promise
you have given and do not deceive me i hold you bound to me and will
not permit you to break your engagement i have better objects in view
than the death a fellowcreature
he then requested to be informed the general tenor the young
man's conduct which he found to be excellent and that he was an
indefatigable officer indeed said the colonel it would give me the
greatest pain to lose him an incomparably affectionate husband
and father he has but one vice to which may be attributed his
destruction viz his inordinate passion for gaming but i cannot feel
justified in screening so flagrant an offender the law must take its
course
moderate your indignation said the worthy baronet assuming a more
serious tone and remember you must be personalty answerable to me for
any disclosure you may think proper to make and that inasmuch as you
injure him you must injure me you have already given him so high a
character in every respect but one that i must interest you further
in his behalf and beg you to assist me in my endeavours to reclaim
instead punishing him
the colonel was surprised but the baronet was inflexible in vain
he urged that the magnitude the crime utterly precluded such a
proceeding
 it must be done said the baronet it shall be done leave all the
consequences to me he has now left us in extreme though suppressed
agitation there is no time to lose fly to save him
the colonel expressed his readiness to try the experiment
 then said the baronet follow him immediately assure him 
my forgiveness and that if he will pledge his word to forsake this
dangerous vice what he has already obtained he may hold as a gift and
i will add whatever may be necessary to extricate him from any temporary
embarrassment
it was an important embassy life or death was to be decided by it the
colonel took his departure certain finding him at home taking leave
 his family and reaching his habitation a short time after his
arrival witnessed a scene misery which although he had partly
anticipated he could not have conceived he found him surrounded by
his wife and children in an agony desperation and despair
when he entered the apartment the poor culprit convinced by the
presence his colonel that all was lost fell on his knees and
supplicated if possible that his fame not his life might be spared for
the sake his afflicted but innocent and injured family language has
no power to describe the surprise and consternation with which after a
severe lecture he received the joyful intelligence which
his colonel was the bearer he returned with his commanding officer
to square where he was received by the baronet as a repentant
friend and has lived to repair his error and become deservedly
distinguished as an ornament to society civil and religious as well as
military
that must be truly gratifying to the worthy baronetcy said tom
no doubt it continued sparkle it must be a source continued
pleasure to find his labours have had so beneficial a result having in
all probability saved a whole family from destruction surely it may be
said that
among the idiot pranks wealth's abuse
none seem so monstrous none have less excuse
than those which throw an heritage away
upon the lawless chance desperate play
nor is there among knaves a wretch more base
than he who steals it with a smiling face
who makes diversion to destruction tend
and thrives upon the ruin a friend
yet the greek like the swindlers and the horse jockey
 swindler is a term originally derived from the german
schwindel which signifies merely to cheat it was first
introduced as a cant term and used to signify obtaining 
goods credit or money under false pretences it has since
had a legislative adoption being parliamentary recognised
by an act for the prevention it the artifices schemes
and crimes resorted to by these gentry are so numerous
that it would be impossible to describe them all one mode
 practice however is not uncommon in london
three or four swell jews contrive to hire a large house with
some spare rooms in the city that are turned into
warehouses in which are a number casks boxes e
filled with sand and also a quantity large sugarloaves
in appearance which are only clay done up in blue paper
but corded and made up with great nicety
an elegant countinghouse is likewise furnished with books
and other apparatus to deceive the eye and give the
appearance extensive business great regularity and
large property the clerks in attendance are a set jews
who are privy to the scheme and equally ready at fraud as
those who profess to be the principals
a diningroom elegantly furnished upon the mace receives
you
the mace is a person who carries all the appearance a
great and rich man with servants carriages c for the
purpose defrauding tradesmen and others by all manner 
plans most calculated to entrap the parties they intend to
dupe
whenever it is necessary to admit your visits a black
servant opens the streetdoor and the foot the staircase
presents surtouts boots liverycloths a large bluecoat
with a yellow cape and habiliments in which the
opulent array their servants with these and similar
merchantlike appearances trade is commenced and persons
dispatched to provincial manufacturing towns to buy various
articles for the amount the first purchases bills are
drawn upon the firm and even before the goods are pack'd
up and sent according to order the acceptances are paid
and by this means credit is partly established which
once accomplished they are in want large assortments for
exportation upon credit at one two and three months the
goods are accordingly chosen and forwarded to their
associates in london where they are immediately disposed
 at or per cent cheaper than the prime cost and
the money realised the first bills become due are noted
and protested the second are presented but the house has
stopped payment and the owners are bankrupts by the time
the third month's bills become due the docket is struck
the assignees chosen and there is not sixpence in the pound
left for the creditors petitions are ineffectually
presented to the chancellor for a number fictitious
creditors the same profession and persuasion overswear
the just ones and by exceeding them in number and value
the house obtains its certificate and has again the power
 committing similar depredations
perhaps the most daring and systematic proceeding thief faded age
teeth for the toothless ringlets for the bald
heav'n earth and ocean plunder'd their sweets
nectareous essences olympian dews
sermons and city feasts and fav'rite airs
ethereal journeys submarine exploits
and katerfelto with his hair on 
at his own wonders wond'ring for his bread
well said tom it must be confessed that a newspaper is a most
convenient and agreeable companion to the breakfasttable laying
down the times as he spoke it is a sort literary hatchpotch
calculated to afford amusement suited to all tastes rank and degrees
it contains
tales love and maids mistaken
 battles fought and captives taken
then i presume said bob you have been gratified and interested in
the perusal
it is impossible to look down the columns a newspaper replied tom
without finding subjects to impart light and all the journals
 the present day the times appears to me the best in point 
information and conduct but i spoke newspapers generally there
is such a mixture the utile et dulce that the merchant and the
mechanic the peer the poet the prelate and the peasant are all
deeply concerned in its contents in truth a newspaper is so true a
mark the caprice englishmen that it may justly be styled their
coat arms the turkish koran is not near so sacred to a
rigid mahometan a parishdinner to an overseer a turtlefeast to an
alderman or an election to a freeholder as a gazette or newspaper to
an englishman by it the motions the world are watched and in some
degree governed the arts and sciences protected and promoted the
virtuous supported and stimulated the vicious reproved and
corrected and all informed
consequently said bob a good newspaper is really a valuable
article
doubtless continued tom and john bull mistake me not i don't
mean the paper which bears that title i mean the population england
enjoy a newspaper and there are some who could not relish their
breakfasts without one it is a sort general sauce to every thing
and to the quid nunc is indispensable for if one informs him a
naval armament he will not fail to toast the admirals all round in pint
bumpers to each wishes them success gets drunk with excessive loyalty
and goes with his head full seventyfours sixtyfours frigates
transports fireships c in its diversified pages persons every
rank denomination and pursuit may be informed the philosopher the
politician the citizen the handicraftsman and the gossip are regaled
by the novelty its contents the minuteness its details and the
refreshing arrivals transactions which occupy the attention human
beings at the greatest or nearest distances from usa
messenger grief
perhaps to thousands and joy to some
what is it but a map life
its fluctuations and its vast concerns
it may with propriety be compared to the planetary system the light
which it diffuses round the mental hemisphere operates according as
it is seen felt understood or enjoyed for instance the miser
is gladdened by an account the rise the stocks the mariner
is rejoiced at the safety his vessel after a thunderstorm the
manufacturer to hear the revival foreign markets the merchant
that his cargo is safely arrived the member that his election is
secured the father that his son is walling to return home the
poet that his production has been favourably received by the
public the physician that a difficult cure is transmitting his fame
to posterity the actor that his talents are duly appreciated the
agriculturist that grain fetches a good price the upright man that
his character is defended the poor man that beer meat bread and
vegetables are so within his reach that he can assure himself being
able to obtain a good sunday's dinner
tho they differ in carrie all alike just the same morning
chronicle times advertiser british press morning post news what
a host we read every day and grow wiser the examiner whig all alive
to the gig while each one his favourite chooses star traveller and
sun to keep up the fun and tell all the world what the news is
well done said bob you seem to have them all at your tongue's 
and their general contents in your head but for my part i am struck

a bitter pang the death a relative or hopeful lover it is as a

kept terms with mr l at oxford on her return she got acquainted
with a capt cr ks whom she contrived soon afterwards to lodge in
the next room to her husband in the bench but to whom she kindly gave
the preference in her visits
whether c l w lk s the linendraper or capt c k
be the most favoured swain or swine i venture not to say but the
former has devoted his time his chariot and his female acquaintances
boxes in public to her as a pledge his love she helped herself to
a loose picture great value belonging to him which very nearly fell
into the hands john doe or richard roe on her husband's account
afterwards the palm should however certainly be given to mr l 
as he courted her classically moralized to her sentimentally sung
psalms and prayed with her fervently and on all occasions treated her
like a lady
ha said a fashionably dressed young man who approached towards
dashall ha my dear fellow how goes it with you haven't seen
you this month d d unlucky circumstance wanted you very much
indeed glorious sport all jolly and bang up glad to hear
it said tom sorry you should have experienced any wants on my
account
which way are you going come along i'll tell you such a
spree regular and nothing but you must know a few days ago
sauntering down bondstreet i overtook sir g w ha my gay fellow
said he i thought you were at bury you're the very man i want my
brother jack has lost a rump and dozen to a young one and we want to
make up a select party a set real hardheaded fellows to share
the feast i have already recruited sir m m the buck parson lord
lavender and tom shuffled then there's yourself i hope my brother
and i the young one and a s deputy the reprobate curate whom
we will have to make fun we dine at halfpast seven at long's and
there will be some sport i assure you
i accepted the invitation and met the company before mentioned a
rump and dozen is always a nominal thing there was no rump except
lavender's which projects like a female's from the bottom a
tightlaced pair stays and as for the dozen i believe we drank
nearer three dozen different expensive wines which were tasted one
after the other with a quickness succession which at last left no
taste but a taste for more drink and for all sorts wickedness
this tasting plan is a very successful trick tavern keepers which
enables them to carry off half bottles wine to swell the reckoning
most amazingly and so to bewilder people as to the qualities the
wine that any thing provided it be strong and not acid will go down
at the heel the evening it is also a grand manoeuvre to intoxicate
a johnny raw and to astonish his weak mind with admiration for the
founder the feast therefore the old trick i have got some
particularly highflavoured burgundy which lord lavender very much
approved t'other day and might i sir ask your opinion a new
importation silvery or my lord have bought all the nabob's
east india madeira c was successfully practised
through the first course we were staghunting to a man and killed
the stag just as the second course came on the table this course was
occupied by a great number long shots sir m m and by lavender
offering to back himself and the buck parson against any other two
men in england as to the number head game which they would
bag from sunrise to sunset upon the moors a foot race and a dispute
as to the odds betted on the second october meeting occupied the
third course the desert was enlivened by a list ladies all
descriptions whose characters were cut up full as ably as the haunch 
venison was carved and here boasting success in love was as general
as the custom is base one man fashion goes by the name kiss and
tell
after an hour hard drinking as though it had been for a wager a
number very manly nice little innocent and instructive amusements
were resorted to we had a most excellent maggot race for a hundred and
then a handycap for a future poney race we had pitching a guinea into a
decanter at which the young one lost considerably we had a raffle
for a gold snuff box a challenge fifty against lord lavender's
dusseldorf pipe and five hundred betted upon the number shot to be
put into a joe wanton rifle we played at tetotum and the young
one leaped over a handkerchief six feet high for a wager he performed
extremely well at first but at last lavender who betted against him
kept plying him so with wine and daring him to an inch higher and
higher until at last the young one broke his nose and lost five
hundred guineas by his boyish diversion
now we had a fulminating letter introduced as a hoax upon shuffled
next devils and broiled bones then some blasphemous songs from the
curate who afterwards fell asleep and thus furnished an opportunity
for having his face blacked we then got in a band itinerant
musicians put crackers in their pockets cut off one fellow's tail and
had a milling match betwixt the baronet in the chair and the stoutest 
them who having had spirits wine poured over his head refused tolet
the candle be put to it
peace being restored a regular supper appeared and then a regular
setto at play where i perceived divers signals thrown out such as
rubbing foreheads and chins taking two pinches snuff and other
private telegraphic communications the result which was the young
one just age being greeted to a very great amount
we now sallied forth like a pack in full cry with all the loud
expression mirth and riot and proceeded to old which being
shut up we swore like troopers and broke the parlour windows in a
rage we next cut the traces a hackney coach and led the horses into
a mews where we tied them up coaches being asleep inside the whole
time we then proceeded to old hamadryed the bacon man's called
out fire and got the old man down to the door in his shirt when
lavender ran away with his nightcap and threw it into the water in
st james's square whilst the baronet put it in right and left at his
sconce and told him to hide his d d ugly masard this induced him
to come out and call the watch during which time the buck parson got
into his house and was very snug with the cook wench until the next
evening when old fusty mug went out upon business
after giving a view holloa we ran off with the charleys in full cry
after us when sir g w who had purposely provided himself with a long
cord gave me one and ran to the opposite side jermyn street
with the other in his hand holding it about two feet from the pavement
the old scouts came up in droves and we had em down in a moment for
every mother's son the guardians were caught in the trap and rolled
over each other slap into the kennel never was such a prime bit gig
they lay stunn'd with the fall broken lanterns staves rattles welsh
wigs nightcaps and old hats were scattered about in abundance while
grunting growling and swearing was heard in all directions one
old buck got his jawbone broken another staved in two his crazy
timbers that is to say broke a couple ribs a third bled from the
nose like a pig a fourth squinted admirably from a pair painted
peepers their numbers however increasing we divided our forces and
marched in opposite directions one party sallied along bond street
nailed up a snoosy charley in his box and bolted with his lantern the
others were not so fortunate for a s deputy cushion thumper the
young one and the baronet's brother got safely lodged in st james's
watchhouse
broad daylight now glar'd upon us lavender retired comfortably upon
madame la comtesse in the bench sir m m was found chanting cannons
with some wood nyml dirty ceaseless toil
bear market loads or grovelling weed the soil
some walk abroad a nuisance where they go
and snatch from infamy the bread woe
it is a strange sort infatuation this fashion said bob and it
is much to be regretted it should operate so much to the injury the
fair 
do you see that young man on the opposite side the wayinquired
dashallstopping him short in nankin breeches and jockeyboots
i do replied tallyhoho and pray who is he
the son a wealthy baronet who with an eye to the main chance in
early life engaged in some mercantile speculations which proving
productive concerns have elevated him to his present dignity beyond
which it is said he cannot go on account his having once kept a shop
this son is one what may be termed the ciphers society a sort
 useful article like an in arithmetic to denominate numbers
one those characters if character it may be termed which this
metropolis and its vicinity would furnish us with regiments indeed the
 it is related that a young lady haut ton in paris was observed
to have a tall fellow always following her wherever she went her
grandmother one day asked her what occasion there was for that man to be
always following her to which she replied i must blow my nose must
not i when i want this great genius was actually employed to carry
her pockethandkerchief general run fashionables are little
better than ciphers very necessary at times in the house commons
to suit the purposes and forward the intentions the ministers
by which they obtain titles to which they are not entitled and
transmit to posterity a race ennobled boobies what company what
society does not abound with ciphers and oftentimes in such plenty that
they are even serviceable to make the society considerable what could
we do to express on paper five hundred without the two ciphers or being
compelled to write eleven letters to explain what is equally well done
in three figures these ciphers are useful at general meetings upon
public questions though if they were all collected together in point
 intellectual value they would amount to nought they are equally
important as counters at a cardtable they tell for more than they are
worth among the city companies there are many them to be found and
the army is not deficient though great care is generally taken to send
the most conspicuous ciphers on foreign service public offices under
government swarm with them and how many round o's or ciphers may be
found among the gentlemen the long robe who as hudibras observes
never ope
their mouths but out there flies a trope
in the twelve judges it must be allowed there is no cipher because they
have two figures to support them but take these two figures away and
the whole wit mankind may be defied to patch up or recruit the number
without having recourse to the race ciphers
i have known a cipher make a profound statesman and a secretary nay
an ambassador but then it must be confess'd it has been by the timely
and prudent application proper supporters and it is certain that
ciphers have more than once shewn themselves significant in high posts
and stations and in more reigns than one bounteous nature indulges
mankind in a boundless variety characters as well as features and
has given ciphers to make up numbers and very often by such additions
renders the few much more significant and conspicuous the church has
its ciphers for a mitre looks as well on a round as on any letter in
the alphabet and the expense to the nation is equally the same
consequently john bull has no right to complain
see in compose a polite divine
more gay than grave not half so sound as fine
the ladies parson proudly skill'd is he
to tend their toilet and pour out their tea
foremost to lead the dance or patient sit
to deal the cards out or deal out small wit
then oh in public what a perfect beau
so powder'd and so trimm'd for pulpit show
so well equipp'd to tickle ears polite
with pretty little subjects short and trite
well cull'd and garbled from the good old store
 polish'd sermons often preached before
with precious scraps from moral shakespeare brought
to fill up awkward vacancies thought
or shew how he the orator can play
whene'er he meets with some good thing to say
or prove his taste correct his memory strong
nor let his fifteen minutes seem too long
his slumbering mind no knotty point pursues
save when contending for his tithes or dues
thus far although it must be allowed that ciphers are use it is not
every cipher that is truly useful there are ciphers indolence to
which some mistaken men give the title men fine parts there are
ciphers selfinterest to which others more wrongfully give the name
 patriots there are bacchanalian ciphers who will not leave the
bottle to save the nation but will continue to guzzle till no one
figure in arithmetic is sufficient to support them then there are
ciphers venus who will abandon all state affairs to follow a
cyprian even at the risk injuring a deserving wife military
ciphers who forsake the pursuit glory and distrustful their own
merit or courage affirm their distrust by a sedulous attendance at the
levees men power in short every man in my humble opinion is
no other than a cipher who does not apply his talents to the care his
morals and the benefit his country
you have been ciphering for some time said boh and i suppose you
have now finished your sum
i confess continued tom it has been a puzzling one for to make
something out nothing is impossible
not in all cases said bob
how so why you have proved it by your own shewing that these
nothings are to be made something 
i perceive replied tom that your acquaintance with sparkle is
not thrown away upon you and it argues well for if you are so ready
a pupil at imbibing his lessons you will soon become a proficient
in london manners and conversation but a cipher is like a round
robin it has neither beginning nor its centre is vacancy
its circle ambiguity and it stands for nothing unless in certain
connections
they were now proceeding gently along oxford street in pursuit their
way to soho square and met with little worthy note or remark until
they arrived near the newman street where a number workmen
were digging up the earth for the purpose making newdrains the
pathway was railed from the road by scaffolding poles strongly driven
into the ground and securely tied together to prevent interruption from
the passengers tom was remarking upon the hardihood and utility 
the labourers at the moment when a fountain water was issuing from
a broken pipe which arose as high as a two pair stairs window a
circumstance which quickly drew a number spectators around and
among the rest tom and his cousin could not resist an inclination to
spend a few minutes in viewing the proceedings
the irish gentlemen who made two or three ineffectual attempts to
stop the breach alternately got soused by the increased violence 
the water and at every attempt were saluted by the loud laughter the
surrounding multitude
to feelings naturally warm and irritable these vociferations 
amusement and delight at their defeat served but to exasperate and
enrage and the irishmen in strong terms expressed their indignation
at the merriment which their abortive attempts appeared to excite
at length one the paddies having cut a piece wood as he
conceived sufficient to stop the effusion water with some degree
 adroitness thrust his arm into the foaming fluid and for a moment
appeared to have arrested its progress
bloodanowns murphy cried he scoop away the water and be
after handing over the mallet this way in a moment the spades his
comrades were seen in
 round rubin a letter or billet so composed as to have
the signatures many persons in a circle in order that
the reader may not be able to discover which the party
signed first or last
action to accomplish his instructions while one who was not in a
humour to hear the taunts the crowd very politely scoop'd the water
with his hands among the spectators which created a general desire
to avoid his liberal and plentiful besprinkled and at the same time
considerable confusion among men women and children who in effecting
their escape were seen tumbling and rolling over each other in all
directions
be off wit you all and be d d to you said the hibernian while
those who were fortunate enough to escape the cooling fluid he was
so indifferently dispensing laughed heartily at their less favoured
companions
bob was for moving onward
hold said dash all it is two to one but you will see some fun
here
he had scarcely said the word when a brawny porter in a fustian jacket
with his knot slung across his shoulder manifested dislike to the
manner in which the irish gentleman was pursuing his amusement
d n your irish eyes said he don't throw your water here or
i'll lend you my bunch fives l
be after being off there replied pat and without hesitation
continued his employment
the porter was resolute and upon receiving an additional salute jumped
over the railings and resaluted poor pat with a muzzle which
drew his claret in a moment the irishman endeavoured to rally while
the crowd cheered the porter and hooted the labourer this was the
signal for hostilities the man who had plunged up the broken pipe let
go his hold and the fountain was playing away as briskly as ever all
was confusion and the neighbourhood in alarm the workmen with spades
and pickaxes gathered round their comrade and there was reason to
apprehend serious mischief would occur one them hit the porter with
his spade and several others were prepared to follow his example while
a second who seem'd a little more bloodthirsty than the rest raised
his pickaxe in a menacing attitude upon perceiving which dashall
jump'd over the rail and
 bunch fives a flash term for the fist frequently made
use among the lads the fancy who address each other
sometimes in a friendly way with ha bill how goes it
tip us your bunch fives my boy
 muzzle a blow on the mouth
arrested his arm or if the blow had been struck murder must
have ensued in the mean time several other persons following tom's
example had disarmed the remainder a fellowlabourer who had been
engaged at a short distance from the immediate scene action
attacked the man who had raised the pickaxe between whom a pugilistic
encounter took place the former swearing by jesus they were a set
 cowardly rascals and deserved quilting the water was flowing
copiously shovels pickaxes barrows lanterns and other implements
were strewed around them the crowd increased tom left the combatants
when he conceived no real danger unfair advantage being taken was to
be apprehended to enjoy their rolling in the mud while the porter
who had escaped the vengeance his opponents was explaining to
those around him and expostulating with the first aggressor upon
the impropriety his conduct the shouts the multitude at the
courageous proceedings the porter and the hooting at the shameful
and cowardly manner defence pursued by the labourers roused
the blood the irishmen and one again seized a spade to attack a
coalheaver who espoused the cause the porter a disposition was
again manifested to cut down any one who dared to entertain opinions
opposite to their own immediately a shower mud and stones was
directed towards him the spade was taken away and the irishmen armed
themselves in a similar way with the largest stones they could find
suitable for throwing in this state things the houses and the
windows in the neighbourhood were threatened with serious damage the
crowd retreated hallooing shouting hissing and groaning and in this
part the affray bob got himself well bespattered with mud tom again
interfered and after a few minutes persuaded the multitude to desist
and the irishmen to drop their weapons the porter made his escape and
the men resumed their work but upon dashall's return to the
 quilting to quilt a person among the knowing copies is
to give another a good thrashing probably this originated
in the idea warming as a quilt is a warm companion so a
setto is equally productive heat whether the allusion
holds good with respect to comfort must be left to the
decision those who try it on which is to make any
attempt or essay where success is doubtful
spot where he had left tallyhoho the latter was not to be found he
was however quickly relieved from suspense
sir said a stout man the neighbourhood is greatly indebted to
your exertions in suppressing a riot from which much mischief was to be
apprehended your friend is close at hand if you will step this way
you will find him he is getting his coat brushed at my house and has
sustained no injury
it is a lucky circumstance for him said tom and i think
myself fortunate upon the same account for i assure you i was
very apprehensive some serious mischief resulting from the
disturbance

as they entered the house a few doors up newman street tallyhoho met
them having divested himself the mud which had been thrown upon his
garments by the indiscriminating hand an enraged multitude and after
politely thanking the gentleman for his friendly accommodation they
were about to proceed to the place their original destination when
dashall perceiving an elegantly dressed lady on the opposite side 
the way felt instinctively as it were for the usual appendage a
modern fashionable the quizzingglass in the performance this he
was subjected to a double disappointment for his rencontre with the
hibernian had shivered the fragile ornament to atoms in his pocket
and before he could draw forth the useless fragments the more important
object his attention was beyond the power his visual orbs
it might have been worse said he as he survey'd the broken bauble
it is a loss which can easily be repaired and if in losing that
i have prevented more serious mischief there is at least some
consolation apropos here is the very place for supplying the defect
without loss time dixon continued he looking at
 this gentleman whose persevering endeavours in his
profession entitle him to the patronage the public
without pretending to second sight or the powers that are
so frequently attributed to the seventh son a seventh
son has thrown some new lights upon the world although he
does not pretend to make helps to read his establishment
at no newman her and pay no attention whatever to the
figure or steps but walk as deliberately as the music will admit not
dropping your little chit chat through the dance which is considered
undoubtedly very graceful and less like a mechanic or dancingmaster
the dance finished march into the bar and call for a glass 
blueruin whitetape or starknaked which is a very fashionable
liquor among the ton and if called on to pay for it tell the
landlord you have left your purse in one your blues at home and that
you will recollect it at the next ball this you know can be done ina
genteel way and you will be all the go return into the room and
either tread upon some gentleman's toes or give him a slight touch with
your elbow which if he be inclined to resent tell him pon honour
you did not observe him or if inclined to suffer it with impunity 
get out the way fellow d n you
on your way home after escorting your fair inamorata to her peaceful
abode make a few calls for the purpose taking a little more stimulus
with some particular friends and then return home for the night to
steep your senses in forgetfulness
a very amusing and useful account truly said bob as his cousin
closed his chapter instructions how to cut a dash
it is at least a just and true delineation living character
not without a good portion caricature said mincingait you
are downright scurrilous and ought not to be tolerated in civilized
society sink me if you are not quite a bore and not fit company
for a gentleman so i shall wish you a good morning
tom and bob laughed heartily at this declaration the dashing blade
and wishing him a pleasant walk and a safe return they separated
by this time they had arrived at somerset house it was near three
o'clock and the rooms exhibited a brilliant crowd rank and fashion
which considerably enhanced the value its other decorations
i have already said dashall given you a general description this
building and shall therefore confine my present observations wholly to
the establishment the royal academy for the encouragement the fine
arts for the cultivation which london is now much and deservedly
distinguished and to the progressive improvement in which we are
indebted to that exhibition we have already witnessed this academy
was opened by royal charter in and it consists forty members
called royal academicians twenty associates and six associate
engravers the first president was the justly celebrated sir joshua
reynolds the second the highly respected benjamin west and the
present is sir thomas lawrence
the academy possesses a fine collection casts and models from
antique statues c a school colouring from pictures the best
masters lectures are delivered by the stated professors in their
various branches to the students during the winter season prize
medals are given annually for the best academy figures and drawings
 buildings and gold medals for historical composition in painting
sculpture and designs in architecture once in two years which latter
are presented to the successful artists in full assembly accompanied
with a discourse from the president calculated to stimulate
perseverance and exertion students have at all times except during
the regular vacations an opportunity studying nature from well
chosen models and drawing from the antique casts
this exhibition is generally opened on the first may the number
 works art consisting paintings sculptures models proof
engravings and drawings generally exhibited are upwards one
thousand and are usually visited by all the gaiety and fashion the
metropolis between the hours two and five o'clock in the day
the rooms are elegant and spacious and i consider it at all times
a place where a shilling may be well spent and an hour or two well
enjoyed
some spend a life in classing grubs and try
new methods to impale a butterfly
or bottled up in spirits keep with care
a crowd reptiles hideously rare
while others search the mouldering wrecks time
and drag their stores from dust and rust and slime
coins eat with canker medals half defac'd
and broken tablets never to be trac'd
wormeaten trinkets worn away old
and broken pipkin form'd in antique mould
huge limbless statues busts heads forgot

on entering the rooms bob was bewildered with delight the elegance
 the company the number and excellence the paintings were
attractions so numerous and splendid as to leave him no opportunity
 decidedly fixing his attention he was surrounded by all that
could enchant the eye and enrapture the imagination moving groups 
interesting females were parading the rooms with dashing partners
at their elbows pointing out the most beautiful paintings from the
catalogues giving the names the artists or describing the subjects
seated on one the benches was to be seen the tired dandy whose
principal inducement to be present at this display the arts was to
exhibit his own pretty person and attract a little the public gaze
by his preposterous habiliments and unmeaning countenance to fasten
upon the first person who came within the sound his scarcely
articulate voice with observing it is d d hot pon honour can't
stand it very fatiguing i wonder so many persons are let in at
once there's no such thing as seeing i declare where there is such
a crowd i must come again that's the it on another was the
fulldressed elegant with her bonnet in one hand and her catalogue
in the other apparently intent upon examining the pictures before
her while in fact her grand aim was to discover whether she
herself was observed the lounging blood who had left his horses at
the door was bustling among the company with his quizzingglass in his
hand determined if possible to have a peep at every female he met
caring as much for the exhibition itself as the generality the
visitors cared for him the connoisseur was placing his eye occasionally
close to the paintings or removing to short distances right and left
to catch them in the most judicious lights and making remarks on his
catalogue with a pencil and mrs roundabout from leadenhall who had
brought her son dicky to see the show as she called it declared it was
the most finest sight she ever seed lifting up her hand and eyes at
the same time as dicky read over the list and charmed her by reciting
the various scraps poetry inserted in the catalogue to elucidate
the subjects it was altogether a source inexpressible delight and
amusement tom whose taste for the arts qualified him well for the
office guide upon such an occasion directed the eye his cousin
to the best and most masterly productions in the collection and
whose attention was more particularly drawn to the pictures though
occasionally devoted to the inspection a set wellformed features
or a delicately turned ancle was much pleased to find bob so busy in
enquiry and observation
we have here said tom a combination the finest specimens in the
art painting laid open annually for public inspection music poetry
and painting have always been held in high estimation by those who
mae speech was certainly a bold one and one
which the gentleman would have found some difficulty in
establishing if however the learned gentleman had
substituted the word law for blasphemy he would have been
much nearer the truth
 all the evils with which this country is afflicted that
 an excessive passion for law is the greatest the sum
paid annually in taxes is nothing to that which is spent in
litigation go into our courts justice and you will
often see sixty or seventy lawyers at a time follow them
home and you will find that they are residing in the
fashionable parts the town and living in the most
expensive manner look at the lists the two houses 
parliament and you will find lawyers predominate in the
house commons and in the upper house more peers who
owe their origin to the law than have sprung from the army
and navy united there is scarcely a street any
respectability without an attorney not to mention the
numbers that are congregated in the inns court in london
alone we are told there are nearly three thousand
certificated attornies and in the country they are numerous
in proportion
while on the subject lawyers we shall add a few
unconnected anecdotes which will exhibit the difference
between times past and present
in the rolls parliament for the year there is a
petition from two counties in england stating that the
number attornies had lately increased from sixteen to
twentyfour whereby the peace those counties had been
greatly interrupted by suits and it was prayed that it
might be ordained that there should only be six attornies
for the county norfolk the same number for suffolk and
two for the city norwich
the profits the law have also increased in proportion we
now frequently hear gentlemen at the bar making ten or
fifteen thousand pounds a year by their practice and a
solicitor in one single suit the trial warren hastings
is said to have gained no less than thirtyfive thousand
pounds how different three centuries ago when roper in
his life sir thomas more informs us that though he was
an advocate the greatest eminence and in full business
yet he did not by his profession make above four hundred
pounds per annum there is however a common tradition on
the other hand that sir edward coke's gains at the latter
 this century equalled those a modern attorney
general and by lord bacon's works it appears that he made
l per annum whilst in this office brownlow's profits
likewise one the promontories during the reign 
queen elizabeth were l per annum and he used to close
the profits the year with a laus ceo and when they
happened to be extraordinary maxima laus ceo 
there is no person we believe who is acquainted with the
important duties the judges or the laborious nature 
their office will think that they are too amply
remunerated and it is not a little remarkable that when
law and lawyers have increased so prodigiously the number
 the judges is still the same fortescue in the
dedication his work de claudius legum anglaise to prince
edward says that the judges were not accustomed to sit more
than three hours in a day that is from eight o'clock in
the morning until eleven they passed the remainder the
day in studying the laws and reading the holy scriptures
carte supposes that the great reason for the lawyers
pushing in shoals to become members parliament arose
from their desire to receive the wages then paid them by
their constituents by an act the th henry 
lawyers were excluded from parliament not from a contempt
 the common law itself but the professors it who at
this time being auditors to men property received an
annual stipend pro connie immense et impended and
were treated as retainers in maddox's form anglican there
is a form a retainer during his life john de thorp
as counsel to the earl westmoreland and it appears by
the household algerian fifth earl 
northumberland that in the beginning the reign henry
the eighth there was in that family a regular
establishment for two counsellors and their servants
a proclamation was issued on the th november in the
twentieth year the reign james i in which the voters
for members parliament are directed not to choose
curious and wrangling lawyers who may seek reputation by
stirring needless questions
a strong prejudice was at this time excited against lawyers
in aleyn's henry viii london we have the following
philippic against them
a prating lawyer one those which cloud
that honour'd science did their conduct take
he talk'd all law and the tumultuous crowd
thought it had been all gospel that he spake
at length these fools their common error saw
a lawyer on their side but not the law
pride the drayman used to say that it would never be well
till the lawyers gowns like the scottish colours were
hung up in westminster hall
from chaucer's character the temple manciple it would
appear that the great preferment which advocates in this
time chiefly aspired to was to become steward to some great
man he says 
 masters he had mo than thryis ten
that were law expert and curious
 which there were a dozen in that house
worthy to ben stuart house and lone
 any lord that is in england
been employed as clerks to pettifoggers who obtain permission to
sue in their names and persons who know no more law than what they
have learned in abbot's park or on board the fleet who assume
the title law agents or accountants and are admirably fitted for
agents in the insolvent debtor's court under the insolvent act to make
out schedules c being up to all the arts and manoeuvres practised with
success for the liberation themselves they are well calculated to
become tutors others though they generally take care to be well paid
for it
by this time they were entering the temple this continued tom
is an immense range buildings stretching from fleetstreet to
the river north and south and from lombardstreet whitefriars to
essexstreet in the strand east and west
it takes its name from its being founded by the knights templarss in
england the templarss were crusaders who about the year formed
themselves into a military body at jerusalem and guarded the roads
for the safety pilgrims in time the order became very powerful
the templarss in fleetstreet in the thirteenth century frequently
entertained the king the pope's nuncio foreign ambassadors and other
great personages
it is now divided into two societies students called the inner and
middle temple and having the name inns court
these societies consist benchers barristers students and members
the government is vested in the benchers in term time they dine in
the hall the society which is called keeping commons to dine a
fortnight in each term is deemed keeping the term and twelve these
terms qualify a student to be called to year henry the sixth when
sir walter beauchamp as counsel supported the claim precedence 
the earl warwick against the then earl marshal at the bar the
house lords mr roger hunt appeared in the same capacity for the
earl marshal and both advocates in their exordium made most humble
protestations entreating the lord against whom they were retained not
to take amiss what they should advance on the part their own client
another point on which the lawyers the present age differ from their
ancestors is in their prolixity it was reserved for modern invention
to make a trial for high treason last eight days or to extend a speech
to nine hours duration
 abbot's park the king's bench
 on board the fleet the fleet prison
these societies have the following officers and servants a
treasurer subtreasurer steward chief butler three underbutlers
upper and under cook a panniers a gardener two porters two
washpots and watchmen
the benchers assume and exercise a power that can scarcely be
reconciled to the reason the thing they examine students as to their
proficiency in the knowledge the law and call candidates to the bar
or reject them at pleasure and without appeal it is pretty well known
that students in some cases eat their way to the bar in which there can
be no great harm because their clients will take the liberty afterwards
 judging how far they have otherwise qualified themselves but every
man that eats in those societies should be called or the rejection
should be founded solely on his ignorance the law and should be
subject to an appeal to a higher jurisdiction otherwise the power 
the benchers may be exercised on private or party motives
the expence going through the course these societies is not
great in the inner temple a student pays on admission for the fees 
the society l s d which with other customary charges amounts to
l s a duty is also paid to the king which is high terms may be kept
for about s per week and in fact students may dine at a cheaper
rate here than any where beside the expences in the principal societies
 like nature are something more
their kitchens and dinnerrooms merit the inspection strangers
and may be seen on applying to the porter or cooks without fee or
introduction our time is short now or we would take a peep you must
therefore content yourself with my description
the temple is an irregular building in fleetstreet are two entrances
one to the inner and the other to the middle temple the latter has a
front in the manner indigo jones brick ornamented with four large
stone pilastres the ionic order with a pediment it is too narrow
and being lofty wants proportion the passage to which it leads
although designed for carriages is narrow inconvenient and mean
the garden the inner temple is not only a most happy situation but
is laid out with great taste and kept in perfect order it
is chiefly covered with green sward which is pleasing to the eye
especially in a city and is most agreeable to walk on it lies as you
perceive along the river is great extent and has a spacious
gravel walk or terrace on the bank the thames it forms a crowded
promenade in summer and at such times is an interesting spot
the middle temple has a garden but much smaller and not so
advantageously situated
the hall the middle temple is a spacious and elegant room in its
style many great feasts have been given in it in old times it is well
worth a visit
the inner temple hall is comparatively small but is a fine room it is
ornamented with the portraits several the judges before this
hall is a broad paved terrace forming an excellent promenade when the
gardens are not sufficiently dry
there are two good libraries belonging to these societies open to
students and to others on application to the librarian from ten in the
morning till one and in the afternoon from two till six
the temple church belongs in common to the two societies the knights
templarss built their church on this site which was destroyed and the
present edifice was erected by the knights hospitallers it is in the
norman style architecture and has three aisles running east and
west and two cross aisles at the western is a spacious round
tower the inside which forms an elegant and singular entrance into
the church from which it is not separated by close walls but merely by
arches the whole edifice within has an uncommon and noble aspect the
roof the church is supported by slight pillars sussex marble and
there are three windows at each side adorned with small pillars the
same marble the entire floor is flags black and white marble
the roof the tower is supported with six pillars having an upper and
lower range small arches except on the eastern side opening into
the church the length the church is eightythree feet the breadth
sixty and the height thirtyfour the height the inside the tower
is fortyeight feet and its diameter on the floor fiftyone
in the porch or tower are the tombs eleven knights templarss eight
 them have the figures armed knights on them three them
being the tombs so many earls pembroke the organ this church
is one the finest in the world
the temple church is open for divine service every day at eleven
o'clock in the morning and at four in the afternoon there are four
entrances into the temple besides those in fleetstreet and it is
a thoroughfare during the day but the gates are shut at night the
gardens are open to the public in summer it is a place much business
and constant traffic i assure you
i perceive it said bob by the number persons passing and
repassing every one apparently animated and impelled by some business
 importance
yes it is something like a steamboiler by which a considerable
portion the engines the law are kept in motion they can alarm and
allay according to the pockets their customers or the sagacity which
they are able to discover in their heads there are perhaps as many
quacks in this profession as in any other continued tom as they
regained fleetstreet when perceiving it was half past four o'clock by
st dunstan's but we must now make the best our way or we may be
cut out the good things this globe 
what are so many persons collected together here for enquired bob
merely to witness a little ingenious machinery keep your eye on the
two figures in the front the church with clubs in their hands
i do said bob but there does not appear to me to be any thing very
remarkable about them
he scarcely uttered the words when he observed that these figures
struck their clubs upon the bells which hung between them to denote the
time day
these figures said tom and the circumstance giving them motion
every fifteen minutes by the movements the clock have attracted a
great deal notice particularly among persons from the country and
at almost every quarter an hour throughout the day they are honoured
with spectators the church itself is very ancient and has been
recently beautified the bell thunders whose abilities you have just
had a specimen have been standing there ever since the year 
it is hard service said bob and they must certainly deserve a
pension from government more than many the automatons who are
now in the enjoyment the national bounties
you are right enough said a translator soles who had overheard
bob's last remark with a pair old shoes under his arm and d n
me if i would give a pair crazy crab shells without vamp or
wheat for the whole boiling em there is not one on em worth a
bloody jemmy
upon hearing this from the political cobbler a disturbed sort shout
was uttered by the surrounding spectators who had rather increased than
diminished in number to hear the observations the leathernlonged
orator when tom giving his cousin a significant pinch the arm
impelled him forward and left them to the enjoyment their humour
political observations are always bad in the street said tom it is
a subject upon which scarcely any two persons agree distinctly old wax
and bristles is about three sheets in the wind and no doubt there
are enough to take advantage any persons stopping at this time the
day
what have we here said bob who observed a concourse people
surrounding the fetter lane
only a couple more striking figures replied tom almost as
intelligent as those we have just seen
 translator soles a disciple st crispin alias a
cobbler who can botch up old shoes so as to have the
appearance being almost new and who is principally
engaged in his laudable occupation by the secondhand booksellers
 field lane turn stile c for the purpose 
turning an honest penny ie to deceive poor purchasers
 crabshells a cant term for shoes
 whole boding em the whole kit em c means the
whole party
 bloody jemmy a cant term for a sheep's head
 three sheets in the wind a cant phrase intending to
explain that a person is more than half drunk
 this was a hint well given by dashall for in the present
times it is scarcely possible to be aware the numerous
depredations that are committed in the streets the
metropolis in open daylight and it is a wellknown fact
that fleet street being one the leading thoroughfares
is at almost all times infested with loose characters 
every description from the welldressed sharpers who hover
round the entrances to billiardtables to mark new comers
and give information to the pals in waiting somewhere
within call and who are called macesto the wily duffers
or buffers willing to sell extraordinary bargains and the
clyfaker or pickpocket
bob bustled forward and looking down the lane perceived two
watchmen one on each side the street bearing poles with black boards
inscribed in white letters beware bad houses and a lantern
hanging to each
these said tom are not decoy ducks but scare crows at least they
are intended for such whether their appearance does not operate as much
one way as it does the other is i believe a matter doubt
beware bad houses said bob i don't exactly see the object
no perhaps not continued his cousin but i will tell you this is a
method which the churchwardens parishes sometimes take shaming
the papa or fie fie ladies from their residences or at least 
discovering their visitors but i am half inclined to think that nine
times out ten the contrary effect is produced for these men who are
stationed as warnings to avoid are easily to be blinded by the gay and
gallant youths who have an inclination to obtain an admission to
the fair cyprians besides which if the first inhabitants are really
induced to quit the house is quickly occupied by similar game and
the circumstance the burning out as it is termed serves as a
directionpost to new visitors so that no real good is eventually
effectedcome we had better move on there is nothing more
extraordinary here
this is peele's coffee house continued he a house celebrated for
its general good accommodations here as well as at the chapter coffee
house in paternoster row all the newspapers are kept filed annually
and may be referred to by application to the waiters at the very
trifling expense a cup coffee or a glass wine the monthly
and quarterly reviews and the provincial papers are also kept for the
accommodation the customers and constitute an extensive and valuable
library it is the frequent resort authors and critics who meet to
pore over the news the day or search the records past times
an excellent way passing an hour said bob and a proof the
studied attention which is paid not only to the comforts and convenience
 their customers but also to their instruction
you are right replied tom in london every man has an opportunity
 living according to his wishes and the powers his pocket
he may dive like frederick random into a cellar and fill his belly for
four pence or regale himself with the more exquisite delicacies the
london tavern at a guinea while the moderate tradesman can be supplied
at a chophouse for a couple shillings and the mechanic by a call at
the shop over the way at the corner water lane may purchase his
half pound ham or beef and retire to a publichouse to eat it where
he obtains his pint porter and in turn has an opportunity reading
the morning advertiser the times or the chronicle up this court
is a wellknown house the sign the old cheshire cheese it has long
been established as a chophouse and provides daily for a considerable
number persons but similar accommodations are to be found in almost
every street in london then again there are cookshops a still
humbler description where a dinner may be procured at a still more
moderate price so that in this great metropolis there is accommodation
for all ranks and descriptions persons who may be served according
to the delicacy their appetites and the state their finances
a chophouse is productive all the pleasures in life it is a
combination the most agreeable and satisfactory amusements indeed
those who have never had an opportunity experiencing the true
happiness therein to be found have a large portion delight and
gratification to discover the heart the mind and the constitution
are to be mended upon crossing its threshold and description must
fall short in its efforts to pourtray its enlivening and invigorating
influence it is in a word a little world within itself absolutely
a universe in miniature possessing a system peculiar to itself 
planets and satellites
 this allusion was made by the hon tom dashall to the shop
 mr cantus who was formerly in the employ mr expand
whose appearance in opposition to him at temple bar a
few years back excited a great deal public attention and
had the effect reducing the prices their ham and beef
mr epps generally has from fourteen to twenty shops and
sometimes more situated in different parts the
metropolis and there is scarcely a street in london where
there is not some similar place accommodation but mr
epps is the most extensive purveyor for the public appetite
at these shops families may be supplied with any quantity
from an ounce to a pound hot boiled beef and ham at
moderate prices while the poor are regaled with a plate 
cuttings at a penny or twopence each
and fixed stars and revolutions and its motions are annual rotatory
and diurnal in all its extensive diversity waiters cooks
saucepans frying pans gridirons salamanders stoves and smokejacks
so that if you wish to know true and enclosing delight you are now
acquainted with where it is to be found not all the sages the
ancient or the modern world ever dreamed a theory half so exquisite
or calculated to afford man a treat so truly delicious
within the doors a chophouse are to be found food for both body
and soulmortal and mental appetitesfeasting for corporeal cravings and
cravings intellectualnourishment at once for the faculties both mind
and body there in fact the brain may be invigorated and the mind fed
with good things while the palate is satisfied by devouring a mutton
chop a veal cutlet or a beef steak and huge draughts wisdom may be
imbibed while drinking a bottle soda or a pint humble porter
in this delightful place amusement and convenience there is
provender for philosophers or fools stoics or epicurean contemplation
for genius all denominations and it embraces every species 
science and art having an especial eye to the important art 
cookery it encompasses all that is worthy the sublimest faculties
and capacities the soul it is the resort all that is truly good
and glorious on earth the needy and the noble the wealthy and the
wise its high estimation is universally acknowledged it has the
suffrage the whole world so much so that at all times and in all
seasons its supremacy is admitted and its influence recognized the
name the very name alone is sufficient to excite all that is
pleasant to our senses five or seven how many soever there may be a
chophouse at that word what delightful prospects are presented to the
mind's eyewhat a clashing knives and forks and plates and pewter
pots and rushing footsteps and murmuring expectant hosts enter
into our delighted ears what gay scenes varied beauty and many
natured viands and viscous soups tarts puddings and pies rise before
our visual nerveswhat fragrant perfumes sweet scented odours

effects will produce a radical advantageits component parts go down
with the world and are well digested
your description said bob has already had the effect awakening
appetite and i feel almost as hungry as if i were just returning from a
foxchace
then continued the hon tom dashall it is not only admirable asa
whole its constituent and individual beauties are as provocative 
respect as the mass is our veneration from among its innumerable
excellencies i will mention one which deserves to be held in
recollection and kept in our contemplationwhat is more delightful
than a fine beefsteakspite lexicographers there is something
 harmony even in its name it seems to be the keynote our best
constructed organs organs differing from all others only because they
have no stops it circles all that is full rich and sonorous i do
not mean in its articulated enunciation but in its internal
acceptation there there we feel all its strength and diapas or force
and quantity
admirable arrangements indeed said bob true continued

daffy's
daffy's said tallyhothat is somewhat new to me i don't recollect
hearing it before
daffy's elixir replied dashall was a celebrated quack medicine
formerly sold by a celebrated doctor that name and recommended by
him as a cure for all diseases incident to the human frame this gin
old tom and blue ruin are equally recommended in the present day inconsequence
 which some the learned gentlemen the sporting
world have given it the title daffy's though this excellent beverage
is known by many other names
for instance the lady refined sentiments and delicate nerves feels
the necessity a little cordial refreshment to brighten the one and
enliven the other and therefore takes it on the sly under the polite
appellation white wine the knowing kids and dashing swells are fora

disdains to be termed a dry washer dearly loves a dollop old

by this time they were at the globe upon entering which they were
greeted by mortimer and merry well who had arrived before them and
dinner being served almost immediately they were as quickly seated at
the table to partake an excellent repast
 it is a wellknown fact that a person the name 
tiffin announced himself to the world under this very
seductive title which doubtless had the effect 
bringing him considerable custom from the loyal subjects

chapter xvii
here fashion and folly still go hand in hand
with the blades the east and the bucks the strand
the bloods the park and paraders so gay
who are lounging in bond street the most the day
who are foremost in all that is formed for delight
at greeting or wenching or drinking all night
for london is circled with unceasing joys
then east west north and south let us hunt them my boys
 the entrance to the house had attracted tallyhoho's admiration as
they proceeded but the taste and elegance the coffeeroom fitted up
with brilliant chandeliers and presenting amidst a blaze splendour
every comfort and accommodation for its visitors struck him with
surprise in which however he was not suffered to remain long for
merrywell and mortimer had laid their plans with some degree depth
and determination to carry into execution the proposed ramble the
evening and had ordered a private room for the party besides which
they had invited a friend to join them who was introduced to tom and
bob under the title frank harry frank harry was a humorous sort 
fellow who could tell a tough story sing a merry song and was up to
snuff though he frequently got snuffy singing
the bottle's the sun our table
his beams are rosy wine
we planets never are able
without his beams to shine
let mirth and glee abound
you'll soon grow bright
with borrow'd light
and shine as he goes round
he was also a bit a dabbler at poetry a writer songs epigrams
epitaphs c and having been a long resident in the east was thought
to be a very useful guide on such an excursion and proved himself a
very pleasant sort companion he had a dawning pleasantry
in his countenance eradicated by an eye vivacity which seemed to
indicate there was nothing which gave him so much gratification as a
mirthmoving jest
what spirits were his what wit and what whim now cracking a joke and
now breaking a limb
give him but food for laughter and he would almost consider himself
furnished with food and raiment there was however a pedantic manner
with him at times an affectation the clerical in his dress which
upon the whole did not appear to be the newest fashion or improved
by wearing yet he would not barter one wakeful jest for a hundred
sleepy sermons or one laugh for a thousand sighs if he ever sigh'd at
all it was because he had been serious where he might have laugh'd
if he had ever wept it was because mankind had not laugh'd more and
mourn'd less he appeared almost to be made up contrarieties turning
at times the most serious subjects into ridicule and moralizing upon
the most ludicrous occurrences life never failing to conclude his
observations with some quaint or witty sentiment to excite risibility
seeming at the same time to say
how i love to laugh
never was a weeper
care's a silly calf
joy's my casket keeper
during dinner time he kept the table in a roar laughter by declaring
it was his opinion there was a kind puppyism in pigs that they
should wear tails calling a great coat a spencer folio edition with
tailpieces hercules a manmidwife in a small way business because
he had but twelve labours assured them he had seen a woman that morning
who had swallowed an almanac which he explained by adding that her
features were so carbuncled that the red lettered days were visible on
her face that horace ran away from the battle philippi merely to
prove that he was no lame poet he described critics as the doorporters
to the temple fame whose business was to see that no persons slipped
in with holes in their stockings or paste buckles for diamond ones but
was much in doubt whether they always performed their duty honestly he
called the sun the yellowhair'd laddie and the prince 
darkness the black prince ask'd what was the difference between a
sighheaver and a coalheaver but obtaining no answer i will tell you
said he the coalheaver has a load at his back which he can carry buta
sighheaver has one at his heart which he can not carry he had a
whimsical knack quoting old proverbs and instead saying the
cobbler should stick to his last he conceived it ought to be the
cobbler should stick to his wax because he thought that the more
practicable what is bred in the bone said he will not come out with
the skewer and justified his alteration by asserting it must be plain
enough to the fatheaded comprehension those epicurean persons who
have the magpiepropensity prying into marrowbones
dashall having remarked in the course conversation that necessity
has no law 
he declared he was sorry for it it was surely a pity considering
the number learned clerks she might give employ to if she had her
chancellor continued he would have no sinecure it i judge hearing
the petitions her poor brokenfortuned and bankrupt subjects would
take up all his terms though every term were a year and every year
a term thus he united humour with seriousness and seriousness with
humour to the infinite amusement those around him
merrywell who was well acquainted with and knew his humour took
every opportunity what is called drawing him out and encouraging
his propensity to punning a species wit at which he was particularly
happy for puns fell as thick from him as leaves from autumn bowers and
he further entertained them with an account the intention he had some
short time back petitioning for the office punpurveyor to his
late majesty but that before he could write the last line and your
petitioner will ever pun it was bestowed upon a yeoman the guard
still however said he i have an idea opening business as a
punwright in general to his majesty's subjects for the sale and
diffusion all that is valuable in that small ware wit and
intend to advertise puns upon all subjects wholesale retail and for
exportation n b an allowance will be made to captains and gentlemen
going to the east and west indies hooks peaks pococks supplied

 wellknown dramatic authors

deal box price five acts sterling comedy per packet or in small
quantities in courtplaster sized boxes price one melodrama and

munden grin all others are counterfeits long live apollo c c
the cloth being removed the wine was introduced and
as wine whets the wit improves its native force
and gives a pleasant flavour to discourse
frank harry became more lively at each glass egad said he my
intention petitioning to be the king's punster puts me in mind a
story
can't you sing it enquired merrywell
the pipes want clearing out first was the reply and that is a sign
i can't sing at present but signal as it may appear and i see some
telegraphic motions are exchanging my intention is to shew to you all
the doubtful interpretation signs in general
let's have it then said tom but mr chairman i remember an old
song which concludes with this sentiment
tis hell upon earth to be wanting wine
the bottle is out we must replenish
the hint was no sooner given than the defect was remedied and after
another glass
king james on his arrival in london said he was waited on by
a spanish ambassador a man some erudition but who had strangely
incorporated with his learning a whimsical notion that every country
ought to have a school in which a certain order men should be taught
to interpret signs and that the most expert in this department ought
to be dignified with the title professor signs if this plan were
adopted he contended that most the difficulties arising from the
ambiguity language and the imperfect acquaintance which people 
one nation had with the tongue another would be done away signs he
argued arose from the dictates nature and as they were the same
in every country there could be no danger their being misunderstood
full this project the ambassador was lamenting one day before
the king that the nations europe were wholly destitute this grand
desideratum and he strongly recommended the establishment a college
founded upon the simple principles he had suggested the king either
to humour this quixotic foible or to gratify his own ambition at the
expense truth observed in reply why sir i have a professor
 signs in one the northernmost colleges in my dominions but
the distance is perhaps six hundred miles so that it will be
impracticable for you to have an interview with him pleased with this
unexpected information the ambassador exclaimed if it had been six
hundred leagues i would go to see him and i am determined to set out
in the course three or four days the king who now perceived that
he had committed himself endeavoured to divert him from his purpose
but finding this impossible he immediately caused letters to be
written to the college stating the case as it really stood and desired
the professors to get rid the ambassador in the best manner they were
able without exposing their sovereign disconcerted at this strange and
unexpected message the professors scarcely knew how to proceed they
however at length thought to put off their august visitant by saying
that the professor signs was not at home and that his return
would be very uncertain having thus fabricated the story they made
preparations to receive the illustrious stranger who keeping his word
in due time reached their abode on his arrival being introduced with
becoming solemnity he began to enquire who among them had the honour
 being professor signs he was told in reply that neither 
them had that exalted honour but the learned gentleman after whom
he enquired was gone into the highlands that they conceived his stay
would be considerable but that no one among them could even conjecture
the period his return i will wait his coming replied the
ambassador if it be twelve months
finding him thus determined and fearing from the journey he had
already undertaken that he might be as good as his word the learned
professors had recourse to another stratagem to this they found
themselves driven by the apprehension that they must entertain him as
long as he chose to tarry and in case he should unfortunately weary out
their patience the whole affair must terminate in a discovery 
the fraud they knew a butcher who had been in the habit serving the
colleges occasionally with meat this man they thought with a little
instruction might serve their purpose he was however blind with one
eye but he had much drollery and impudence about him and very well
knew how to conduct any farce to which his abilities were competent
on sending for geordy for that was the butcher's name they
communicated to him the tale and instructing him in the part he was to
act he readily undertook to become professor signs especially as he
was not to speak one word in the ambassador's presence on any pretence
whatever having made these arrangements it was formally announced to
the ambassador that the professor would be in town in the course 
a few days when he might expect a silent interview pleased with
this information the learned foreigner thought that he would put his
abilities at once to the test by introducing into his dumb language
some subject that should be at once difficult interesting and
important when the day interview arrived geordy was cleaned up
decorated with a large bushy wig and covered over with a singular gown
in every respect becoming his station he was then seated in a chair
 state in one their large rooms while the ambassador and the
trembling professors waited in an adjoining apartment
it was at length announced that the learned professor signs was
ready to receive his excellency who on entering the room was struck
with astonishment at his venerable and dignified appearance as none 
the professors would presume to enter to witness the interview under
a pretence delicacy but in reality for fear that their presence
might have some effect upon the risible muscles geordy's countenance
they waited with inconceivable anxiety the result this strange
adventure upon which depended their own credit that the king and
in some degree the honour the nation
as this was an interview signs the ambassador began with geordy
by holding up one his fingers geordy replied by holding up two the
ambassador then held up three geordy answered by clenching his fist
and looking sternly the ambassador then took an orange from his pocket
and held it up geordy returned the compliment by taking from his
pocket a piece a barley cake which he exhibited in a similar
manner the ambassador satisfied with the vast attainments the
learned professor then bowed before him with profound reverence and
retired on rejoining the agitated professors they fearfully began to
enquire what his excellency thought their learned brother he is
a perfect miracle replied the ambassador his worth is not to be
purchased by the wealth half the indies may we presume to descend
to particulars returned the professors who now began to think
themselves somewhat out danger gentlemen said the ambassador
when i first entered into his presence i held up one finger to denote
that there is one god he then held up two signifying that the father
should not be divided from the son i then held up three intimating
that i believed in father son and holy ghost he then clenched his
fist and looking sternly at me signified that these three are
one and that he would defy me either to separate them or to make
additions i then took out an orange from my pocket and held it up to
show the goodness god and to signify that he gives to his creatures
not only the necessaries but even the luxuries life then to my
utter astonishment this wonderful man took from his pocket a piece 
bread thus assuring me that this was the staff life and was to be
preferred to all the luxuries in the world being thus satisfied with
his proficiency and great attainments in this science i silently
withdrew to reflect upon what i had witnessed diverted with the
success their stratagem the professors continued to entertain their
visitor until he thought prudent to withdraw no sooner had he retired
than the opportunity was seized to learn from geordy in what manner he
had proceeded to give the ambassador such wonderful satisfaction they
being at a loss to conceive how he could have caught his ideas with
so much promptitude and have replied to them with proportionable
readiness but that one story might not borrow any features from
the other they concealed from geordy all they had learned from the
ambassador and desiring him to begin with his relation he proceeded in
the following manner when the rascal came into the room after gazing
at me a little what do you think gentlemen that he did he held up
one finger as much as to say you have only one eye i then held up
two to let him know that my one eye was as good as both 
his he then held up three as much as to say we have only three eyes
between us this was so provoking that i bent my fist at the scoundrel
and had it not been for your sakes i should certainly have risen from
the chair pulled off my wig and gown and taught him how to insult a
man because he had the misfortune lass
brisk let the bottle circulate
name quickly name each one his fav'rite lass
drive from your brows the clouds fate
fill the sparkling bumper high
let us drain the bottom dry
come thou grapeencircled boy
from thy blissful seats above
crown the present hours with joy
bring me wine and bring me love
fill the sparkling bumper high
let us drain the bottom dry
bacchus o'er my yielding lip
spread the produce thy vine
love thy arrows gently dip
temp'ring them with generous wine
fill the sparkling bumper high
let us drain the bottom dry
in the mean time the enemy life was making rapid strides upon them
unheeded till dashall reminded merrywell their intended visit to
the east and that as he expected a large portion amusement in that
quarter he proposed a move
they were by this time all well primed ripe for a rumpus bangup for a
lark or spree any where any how or with any body they therefore took
leave their present scene gaiety
chapter xviii
wand'ring with listless gait and spirits gay
they eastward next pursued their jocund way
with story joke smart repartee and pun
their business pleasure and their object fun
it was a fine moonlight evening and upon leaving the globe they again
found themselves in the hurry bustle and noise the world the glare
 the gaslights and the rattling coaches carts and vehicles 
variousdescriptions mingled with
the busy hum men
attracted the attention their eyes and ears while the exhilarating
juice the bottle had given a circulation to the blood which
enlivened imagination and invigorated fancy bob conceived himself in
elysium and frank harry was as frisky as a kitten the first object
that arrested their progress was the house mr hone whose political
parodies and whose trials on their account have given him so much
celebrity his window at the moment exhibited his recent satirical
publication entitled a slap at slop and the bridge street gang
 the great wit and humour displayed in this publication
have deservedly entitled it to rank high among the jeu
esprit productions this lively age to describe it were
impossible to enjoy it must be to possess it but for the
information such our readers as are remote from the
metropolis it may perhaps be necessary to give something
like a key explanation to its title a certain learned
gentleman formerly the editor the times said now to bethe
conductor the new times who has by his writings
rendered himself obnoxious to a numerous class readers
has been long known by the title dr slop in his
publication denominated the mock times and the slop pail
he has been strenuous in his endeavours to support and
uphold a society said to miscall themselves the
constitutional society but now denominated the bridge
street gang and the publication alluded to contains
humorous and satirical parodies and sketches the usual
contents his slop pail with a life the learned
doctor and an account the origin the gang
 here said tom we are introduced at once into a fine field
 observation the inhabitant this house defended himself in three
different trials for the publication alleged impious profane and
scandalous libels on the catechism the litany and the creed st
athanasius with a boldness intrepidity and perseverance almost
unparalleled as they followed in immediate succession without even an
allowance time for bodily rest or mental refreshment
yes continued frank harry and gained a verdict on each occasion
notwithstanding the combined efforts men in power and those whose
constant practice in our courts law with learning and information at
their fingers ends rendered his enemies fearful antagonists
it was a noble struggle said tallyhoho i remember we had accounts
 it in the country and we did not fail to express our opinions by
subscriptions to remunerate the dauntless defender the rights and
privileges the british subject
tip us your flipper said harrythen i see you are a true bit
 the bull breed one us as i may say well now you see the spot
 earth he inhabits zounds man in his shop you will find amusement
for a month see here is the house that jack built there is the queen's
matrimonial ladder do you mark what think you these qualifications
for a gentleman
in love and in liquor and overtopped with debt with women with
wine and with duns on the fret
there you have the nondescript
a something a nothing what none understand
bemitred becrowned but without heart or hand
there's jack in the green too and noodles alas
who doodle john bull gold silver and brass
come said dashall you must cut your story short i know if you
begin to preach we shall have a sermon as long as from here to south
america so allons and with this impelling his cousin forward they
 tip us your flipper your manley your saddle or your
thieving hook are terms made use as occasions may suit
the company in which they are introduced to signify a desire
to shake hands
 approached towards saint paul's chiefly occupied in conversation
on the great merit displayed in the excellent designs mr cruikshank
which embellish the work they had just been viewing nor did they
discover any thing further worthy notice till bob's ears were
suddenly attracted by a noise somewhat like that a rattle and
turning sharply round to discover from whence it came was amused with
the sight several small busts great men apparently dancing to the
music a weaver's shuttle
what the devil do you call this said he is it an exhibition 
waxwork or a model academy
neither replied dashall this is no other than the shop a
wellknown dealer in stockings and nightcaps who takes this ingenious
mode making himself popular and informing the passengers that
here you may be served with all patterns and sizes
from the foot to the head at moderate prices
with woolens for winter and cottons for summer let us move on for
there generally is a crowd at the door and there is little doubt but he
profits by those who are induced to gaze as most people do in london
if they can but entrap attention romans is one those gentlemen who
has contrived to make some noise in the world by puffing advertisements
and the circulation poetical handbills he formerly kept a very small
shop for the sale hosiery nearly opposite the eastindia house where
he supplied the sailors after receiving their pay for a long voyage as
well as their doxies with the articles in which he deals by obtaining
permission to style himself hosier to the rt hon east india company
since which finding his trade increase and his purse extended he has
extended his patriotic views clothing the whole population london
by opening shops in various parts and has at almost all times two or
three depositories for
 romans the eccentric hosier generally places a loom near the door
 his shops decorated with small busts some which being attached
to the upper movements the machinery and grotesquely attired in
patchwork and feathers bend backwards and forwards with the motion 
the works apparently to salute the spectators and present to the idea
persons dancing while every passing the shuttle produces a noise
which may be assimilated to that the rattlesnake accompanied with
sounds something like those a dancingmaster beating time to his
scholars his stock at this moment besides what we have just
seen there is one in gracechurch street and another in shoreditch
where the passengers are constantly assailed by a little boy who stands
at the door with some bills in his hand vociferating cheap cheap
then said bob wherever he resides i suppose may really be called
cheapside
with quite as much propriety continued ton as the place we are now
in for as the irishman says in his song
at a place called cheapside they sell every thing dear
during this conversation mortimer merrywell and harry were amusing
themselves by occasionally addressing the numerous ladies who were
passing and taking a peep at the shops giggling with girls or
admiring the taste and elegance displayed in the sale fashionable and
useful articles rustled and impeded every now and then by the throng
approaching bow church they made a dead stop for a moment
what a beautiful steeple exclaimed bob i should though no
architect prefer this to any i have yet seen in london
your remark replied dashall does credit to your taste it is
considered the finest in the metropolis st paul's displays the grand
effort sir christopher wren but there are many other fine specimens
 his genius to be seen in the city his latin epitaph in st paul's
may be translated thus if you seek his monument look around you and
we may say this steeple if you wish a pillar to his fame lookup
the interior the little church walbrook st stephen's is
likewise considered a
 this church is perhaps unrivalled for the beauty the
architecture its interior for harmony proportion
grace airiness variety and elegance it is not to be
surpassed it is a small church built in the form a
cross the roof is supported by corinthian columns so
disposed as to raise an idea grandeur which the
dimensions the structure do not seem to promise over the
centre at which the principal aisles cross is a dome
divided into compartments the roof being partitioned in a
similar manner and the whole finely decorated the effect
 this buildking is inexpressibly delightful the eye atone
glance embracing a plan full and distinct and
afterwards are seen a greater number parts than the
spectator was prepared to expect it is known and admired on
the continent as a masterpiece art over the altar is a
fine painting the martyrdom st stephen by west
 chef louvre the same artist and serves to display the
versatility his genius
instead however looking up bob was looking over the way where a
number people collected round a bookseller's window had attracted
his attention
apropos cried dashall the temple apollo we should have
overlook'd a fine subject but for your remark yonder is egg's evening
 auction let us cross and see what's going on he is a fellow 
infinite mirth and good humour and many an evening have i passed at
his auction better amused than by a farce at the theatre
they now attempted to cross but the intervening crowd carriages
three or four deep and in a line as far as the eye could reach for the
present opposed an obstacle
if i could think it said sparkle i'd give you the ode on his
birthday which i once saw in ms it is the jeu esprit a very
clever young poet and who perhaps one these days may be better
known but poets like anatomical subjects are worth but little till
dead
and for this reason i suppose says tom their friends and patrons
are anxious they should rather be starved than die a natural death
oh now i have it let us remain in the churchyard a few minutes
while the carriages pass and you shall hear it
ye hackneycoaches and ye carts
that oft so well perform your parts
for those who choose to ride
now louder let your music grow
your heated axles fiery glow
whether you travel quick or shown
cheapside
for know ye ragged rascals all
as h would in his pulpit bawl
with cheeks extended wide
know as you pass the crowded way
this is the happy natal day
 him whose books demand your stay
in cheapside
twas on the bright propitious morn
when the facetious tegcy was born
 mirth and fun the pride
that nature said good fortune follow
bear him thro life o'er hill and hollow
give him the temple apollo
in cheapside
then o ye sons literature
shew your regard for mother nature
nor let her be denied
hail hail the man whose happy birth
may tell the world mental worth
they'll find the best books on the earth
in cheapside
good exclaimed bob but we will now endeavour to make our way
across and take a peep at the subject the ode
finding the auction had not yet commenced sparkle proposed adjourning
to the burton coffee house in the adjacent passage taking a nip ale
by way refreshment and exhilaration and returning in half an hour
this proposition was cordially agreed to by all except tallyhoho whose
attention was engrossed by a large collection caricatures which
lay exposed in a portfolio on the table beneath the rostrum the
irresistible broad humour the subjects had taken fast hold his
risible muscles and in turning them over one after the other he found
it difficult to part with such a rich fund humour and still more so
to stifle the violent emotion it excited at length clapping his hands
to his sides he gave full vent to the impulse in a horselaugh from a
pair truly stentorian lungs and was by main force dragged out by his
companions
while seated in the comfortable enjoyment their nips ale sparkle
with his usual vivacity began an elucidation the subjects they
had just left the collection caricatures said he which is
considered the largest in london are mostly from the pencil that
selftaught artist the late george woodward and display not only a
genuine and original style humour in the design but a corresponding
and appropriate character in the dialogue or speeches connected with
the figures like his contemporary in another branch the art george
norland he possessed all the eccentricity and thoughtless improvidence
so common and frequently so fatal to genius and had not his good
fortune led him towards bow church he must have suffered severe
privations and perhaps eventually have perished want here he
always found a ready market and a liberal price for his productions
however rude or hasty the sketch or whatever might be the subject 
them
 as to books continued he all ages classes and appetites
may be here suited the superficial dabbler in and pretender to everything
will find collections selections beauties flowers gems c
the man real knowledge may here purchase the elements theory
and practice every art and science in all the various forms and
dimensions from a single volume to the encyclopedia at large
the dandy may meet with plenty pretty little foolscap volumes
delightfully hotpressed and exquisitely embellished the contents 
which will neither fatigue by the quantity nor require the laborious
effort thought to comprehend the jolly bonvivant and bacchanal
will find abundance the latest songs toasts and sentiments and the
wouldbewit will meet with joe miller in such an endless variety 
new dresses shapes and sizes that he may fancy he possesses all the
collected wit ages brought down to the present moment the young
clerical will find sermons adapted
who who will you buy my good matches
who who will you buy my good matches
buy my good matches come buy'em me
 he is usually dressed in something like an old military greatcoat
wears spectacles and walks with a stick
and is a match for any body match him who can cried frank harry
but bless your heart that's nothing to another set gentry who
have infested our streets in clean apparel with a broom in their hands
holding at the same time a hat to receive the contributions the
passengers whose benevolent donations are drawn forth without inquiry
by the appearance the applicant
it must said tallyhoho arise from the distresses the times
there may be something in that said tom but in many instances it
has arisen from the depravity the times to work upon the wellknown
benevolent feelings john bull for those who emulate the public
streets this overgrown and still increasing metropolis and its
principal avenues are continually pestered with impudent impostors 
both sexes soliciting charity men and women young and old who get
more by their pretended distresses in one day than many industrious and
painstaking tradesmen or mechanics do in a week all the miseries
all the pains life with tears that ought to be their honest and
invariable signals can be and are counterfeited limbs which enjoy the
fair proportion nature are distorted to work upon humanity fits
are feigned and wounds manufactured rags and other appearances the
most squalid and abject poverty are assumed as the best engines 
deceit to procure riches to the idle and debaucheries to the infamous
ideal objects commiseration are undoubtedly to be met with though
rarely to be found it requires a being hackneyed in the ways men or
having at least some knowledge the town to be able to discriminate
the party deserving benevolence but
a begging they will go will go
and a begging they will go
the chief cause assigned by some for the innumerable classes 
mendicants that infest our streets is a sort innate principle 
independence and love liberty however it must be apparent that they
do not like to work and to beg they are not ashamed they are
with very few exceptions lazy and impudent and then what is
collected from the humane but deluded passengers is course expended
at their festivals in broad street st giles's or some other equally
elegant and appropriate part the town to which we shall at an early
period pay a visit their impudence is intolerable for if refused
a contribution they frequently follow up the denial with the vilest
execrations
to make the wretched blest
private charity is best
the common beggar spurns at your laws indeed many their arts are so
difficult detection that they are enabled to escape the vigilance 
the police and with impunity insult those who do not comply with their
wishes seeming almost to say
while i am a beggar i will rail
and say there is no sin but to be rich
and being rich my virtue then shall be
to say there is no vice but beggary
begging has become so much a sort trade that parents have been
known to give their daughters or sons the begging certain streets in
the metropolis as marriage portions and some years ago some scoundrels
were in the practice visiting the outskirts the town in sailors
dresses pretending to be dumb and producing written papers stating
that their tongues had been cut out by the algerine by which means
they excited compassion and were enabled to live well
no doubt it is a good trade said merry well and i expected we
should have been made better acquainted with its real advantages by
capt barclay walking and sporting celebrity who it was said had
laid a wager l that he would walk from london to edinburgh in
the assumed character a beggar pay all his expences living well
on the road and save out his gains fifty pounds
true said tom but according to the best account that can be
obtained that report is without foundation the establishment however
 the mendicity society's
 the frauds and impositions practised upon the public are
so numerous that volumes might be filled by detailing the
arts that have been and are resorted to by mendicants and
the records the society alluded to would furnish
instances that might almost stagger the belief the most
credulous the life the infamous vaux exhibits numerous
instances in which he obtained money under genteel
professions by going about with a petition soliciting the
aid and assistance the charitable and humane and
therefore are continually cheats who go from door to door
collecting money for distressed families or for charitable
purposes it is however a subject so abundant and
increasing by every day's observation that we shall for the
present dismiss it as there will be other opportunities in
the course the work for going more copiously into it
 is calculated to discover much on this subject and has already
brought to light many instances depravity and deception well
deserving the serious consideration the public
as they approached the the poultry this said dashall is
the heart the first commercial city in the known world on the right
is the mansion house the residence the lord mayor for the time
being
the moon had by this time almost withdrawn her cheering beams and there
was every appearance from the gathering clouds a shower rain
it is rather a heavy looking building from what i can see at present
replied tallyhoho
egad said tom the appearance every thing at this moment is
gloomy let us cross
with this they crossed the road to debate's the pastry cook's shop
zounds said tom casting his eye upon the clock it is after ten i
begin to suspect we must alter our course and defer a view the east
to a more favourable opportunity and particularly as we are likely to
have an accompaniment water
never mind said merrywell we can very soon be in very comfortable
quarters besides a rattler is always to be had or a comfortable
lodging to be procured with an obliging bedfellow don't you begin to
croak before there is any occasion for it what has time to do with us
aye aye said frank harry don't be after damping us before we
get wet this is the land plenty and there is no fear being
lost come along
on the opposite side said tom addressing his cousin is the bank 
england it is a building large extent and immense business you can
now only discern its exterior by the light the lamps it is however
a place to which we must pay a visit and take a complete survey
upon some future occasion in the front is the royal exchange the daily
resort the merchants and traders the metropolis to transact their
various business
come said merry well i find we are all upon the right scent frank
harry has promised to introduce us to a house well known resort in
this neighbourhood we will shelter ourselves under the staple commodity
 the country for the woolsack and the woolpack i apprehend are
synonymous
well thought indeed said dashall it is a house where you may
at all times be certain good accommodation and respectable
society besides i have some acquaintance there long standing and
may probably meet with them so have with you my boys the woolpack
in cornhill continued he addressing himself more particularly to
tallyhoho is a house that has been long established and deservedly
celebrated for its general accommodations partaking as it does the
triple qualifications tavern chophouse and publichouse france
amusing those around him with conjuring tricks to their great
satisfaction and delight nearly opposite the reader the courier satan
elderly gentlemanly with grey hair who heard
 to those who are in the habit visiting this room in an
evening the character alluded to here will immediately be
familiar he is a gentleman well known in the neighbourhood
as an auctioneer and he has a peculiar manner reading
with strong emphasis certain passages at the which
he makes long pauses laughs with inward satisfaction and
not infrequently infuses a degree pleasantry in others
the courier is his favourite paper and if drawn into an
argument he is not to be easily subdued
at arguing too each person own'd his skill
for e'en tho vanquish'd he can argue still
 this gentleman who is also well known in the room where
he generally smokes his pipe an evening is plain and
blunt but affable and communicative in his manners bold in
his assertions and has proved himself courageous in
defending them asthmatic and by some termed phlegmatic
but an intelligent and agreeable companion unless thwarted
in his argument a stanch friend to the late queen and the
constitution his country with a desire to have the
constitution the whole constitution and nothing but the
constitution 
 what was passing but said nothing he however puffed away large
quantities smoke at every pause the reader and occasionally
grinn'd at the contents the paper from which tallyhoho readily
concluded that he was in direct political opposition to its sentiments
the acquisition new company was not lost upon to those who were
seated at the round table and it was not long before the hon tom
dashall was informed that they hoped to have the honour his cousin's
name as a member nor were they backward in conveying a similar hint
to frank harry who immediately proposed his two friends mortimer and
merry well an example which was followed by tom's proposing his cousin
illustration pages road to a fight
such respectable introductions could not fail to meet the approbation
 the gentlemen present consequently they were unanimously elected
knights the round table which was almost as quickly supplied by the
waiter with a capacious bowl punch and the healths the newgate
members drank with three times three when their attention was suddenly
drawn to a distant part the room where a sprightly stripling who
was seated by the swarthy conjuror before mentioned was singing the
following song
the joys a mill
or
a toddle to a fight
now's the time for milling boys since all the world's agog
for it
away to copthorne mouse hurst or clipperton they go
or grave or gay they post away nay pawn their very togs
for it
and determined to be up to all go down to see the show
giddy pated hearts elated cash and courage all to view it
ev'ry one to learn a bit and tell his neighbours how to do it
e'en little sprites in lily whites are fibbing it and rushing it
your dashing swells from bagnigge wells are flooring it and
flushing it
oh tis a sight so gay and so uproarious
that all the world is up in arms and ready for a fight
the roads are so clogg'd that they beggar all description now
with lads and lasses prim'd and grogg'd for bangup fun and
glee
here's carts and gigs and knowing prigs all ready to kick up a row
and ev'ry one is anxious to obtain a place to see
here's a noted sprig life who sports his tits and slumber too
and there is cribs and gully beecher oliver and h armer too
with shelton bitton turner hales and all the lads to go it well
who now and then to please the fancy make opponents know it
well
oh tis a sight c
but now the fight's begun and the combatants are setting to
silence is aloud proclaim'd by voices base and shrill
facing stoppingfibbing dropping claret tapping betting too
reeling rapping physic napping all to grace the mill
losing winning horselaugh grinning mind you do not glance
away
or somebody may mill your mug and your nob in chancery
for nobs and bobs and empty fobs the like no tongue could ever
tell
see here's the heavyhanded gas and there's the mighty nonpareil

oh tis a sight c
thus milling is the fashion grown and ev'ry one a closer is
with lessons from the lads fist to turn out quite the thing
true science may be learn'd where'er the fam'd mendoza is
and gallantry and bottom too from scroggins martin spring
for sparring now is all the rage in town and country places
too
and collarbones and claretmugs are often seen at races too
while counterhits and give and take as long as strength can
hold her seat
afford the best amusement in a bit pugilistic treat
oh tis a sight c
while this song was singing universal silence prevailed but an uproar
 approbation followed which lasted for some minutes with a general
call encore which however soon subsided and the company was again
restored to their former state conversation each party appearing
distinct indulged in such observations and remarks as were most
suitable or agreeable to themselves
bob was highly pleased with this description a milling match and as
the singer was sitting near the person who had excited a considerable
portion his attention at intervals in watching his tricks in some 
which great ingenuity was displayed he asked his cousin if he knew him
know him replied tom to be sure i do that is no other than bitton
a wellknown pugilist who frequently exhibits at the fivescourt he is
a jew and employs his time in giving lessons
zounds said mortimer he seems to have studied the art 
legerdemain as well as the science milling
he is an old customer here said a little gentleman at the opposite
side the table drawing from his pocket a box segars now
sir continued he if you wish for a treat addressing himself to
tallyhoho allow me to select you one there sir is agar like a
nosegay i had it from a friend mine who only arrived yesterday you
don't often meet with such i assure you
bob accepted the offer and was in the act lighting it when bitton
approached toward their the room with some cards in his hand
from which bob began to anticipate he would shew some tricks upon them
as soon as he came near the table he had his eye upon the hon tom
dashall to whom he introduced himself by the presentation a card
which announced his benefit for the next week at the fivescourt when
all the prime lads the ring had promised to exhibit
egad said dashall it will be an excellent opportunity what will
you take a trip that way and see the mighty men fist
with all my heart said tallyhoho
and mine too exclaimed mortimer
it was therefore quickly determined and each the party being
supplied with a ticket bitton canvassed the room for other customers
after which he again retired to his seat
come said a smartly dressed gentleman in a white hat we have heard
a song from the other the room i hope we shall be able to muster
one here
 this gentleman whose dress and appearance indicate
something the dandy is a resident in mark lane and
usually spends his evening at the round table where he
appears to pride himself upon producing the finest sears
that can be procured and generally affords some his
friends an opportunity proving them deserving the
recommendations with which he never fails to present them
this proposition was received with applause and upon tom's giving a
hint frank harry was called upon the glasses were filled a toast was
given and the bowl was dispatched for a replenish he then sung
the following song accompanied with voice manner and action well
calculated to rivet attention and obtain applause
piggish propensities
the bumpkin in town
a bumpkin to london one morning in spring
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
took a fat pig to market his leg in a string
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the clown drove him forward while piggy good lack
lik'd his old home so well he still tried to run back
spoken come come said the bumpkin to himself lunnun is the
grand mart for every thing there they have their auction marts their
coffee marts and their linen marts and as they are fond a tidbit
 country pork i see no reason why they should not have a pork and
bacon mart so get on pig grunts i am glad to hear you have a voice
on the subject though it seems not quite in tune with my
hey derry ho derry fal de rat la
it chanc'd on the road they'd a dreadful disaster
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the grunter ran back twixt the legs his master
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the bumpkin he came to the ground in a crack
and the pig getting loose he ran all the way back
spoken hallo said the clown scrambling up again and scratching
his broken head to be sure i have heard sleightoffhand
hocuspocus and such like but by gum this here be a new manoeuvre
called sleight legs however as no bones be broken between us i'll
endeavour to make use on em once more in following the game in view so
here goes with a
hey derry ho derry c
he set off again with his pig in a rope
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
reach'd london and now for good sale gan to hope
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
but the pig being beat till his bones were quite sore
turning restive rush'd in at a brandyshop door
spoken the genteeler and politer part the world might feel a
little inclined to call this piggish behaviour but certainly after a
long and fatiguing journey nothing can be more refreshing than a drap
 the cratur and deeming this the regular mart for the good stuff in
he bolts leaving his master to sing as long as he pleased hey derry
he deny c
here three snuffy tabbies he put to the rout
hey derry ho derry fal de rai lft
with three drams to the quartern that moment serv'd
out
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the pig gave a grunt and the clown gave a roar
when the whole the party lay flat on the floor
spoken yes there they lay all a lump and a precious group there
was them the old women well prun'd with snuff and twopenny and
bangup with gin and bitters the fair ones squalled the clown growled
like a bear with a broken head the landlord seeing all that could be
seen as they roll'd over each other stared like a stuck pig while
this grand chorus soft and sweet voices from the swinish multitude
was accompanied by the pig with his usual grunt and a
hey derry ho derry o
the pig soon arose and the door open flew
hey derry ho derry fal de rat la
when this scrambling group was expos'd to my view
hey deny ho derry fal de rat la
he set off again without waiting for jack
and not liking london ran all the way back
spoken the devil take the pig said the bumpkin he is more trouble
than enough the devil take you said miss sukey snuffle for you are
the greatest hog the two i dare say if the truth was known you are
brothers i declare i never was so exposed in all my life said miss
delia doldrum there's my beautiful bloom petticoat that never was
rumpled before in all my life i'm quite shock'd never mind said
the landlord nobody cares about it tho i confess it was a shocking
affair i wish he and his pigs were in the horsepond continued she
endeavouring to hide her blushes with her hand oh my oh my what
said boniface oh my elbow equalled out miss emilia mumble i am

by mutual consent the old women all swore
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
that the clown was a brute and his pig was a boar
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
he paid for their liquor but grumbled good lack
without money or pig to gang all the way back
spoken by gum said he to himself as he turn'd from the door if the
lunneners likes country pork country pork dont seem to like they and
if this be the success i'm to expect in this mighty great town in search
 the grand mart i'll come no more for i thinks as how its all a
flax therefore i'll make myself contented to set at home in my own
chimney corner in the country and sing
hey derry ho derry c
this song had attracted the attention almost every one in the room
there was a spirit and vivacity in the singer combined with a power 
abruptly changing his voice to give effect to the different passages
and a knowledge music as well as character which gave it an
irresistible charm and the company who had assembled round him at the
close signified their approbation by a universal shout applause
all went on well songs toasts and sentiments punch puns and
witticisms were handed about in abundance in the mean time the
room began to wear an appearance thinness many the boxes were
completely deserted and the knights the bound table were no
longer surrounded by their esquires still the joys the bowl were
exhilarating and the conversation agreeable though at times a little
more in a strain vociferation than had been manifested at the
entrance our party it was no time to ask questions as to the names
and occupations the persons by whom he was surrounded and bob
plainly perceiving frank harry was getting into queer street very
prudently declined all interrogatories for the present making however
a determination within himself to know more the house and the
company
mortimer also discovered symptoms lushlogic for though he had an
inclination to keep up the chaff his dictionary appeared to be new
modelled and his lingo abridged by repeated clips at his mother tongue
by which he afforded considerable food for laughter
perceiving this tallyhoho thought it prudent to give his cousin a hint
which was immediately taken and the party broke up
chapter xix
o there are swilling wights in london town
term'd jolly dogs choice spirits alias swine
who pour in midnight revel bumpers down
making their throats a thoroughfare for wine
these spendthrifts who life's pleasures thus outrun
dosing with headaches till the afternoon
lose half men's regular estate sun
by borrowing too largely the moon
and being bacchi plexus full wine
although they have a tolerable notion
 aiming at progressive motion
tis not direct tis rather serpentine
upon leaving the house it was quickly discovered that mortimer was at
sea without a rudder or compass but was still enabled to preserve the
true line beauty which is said to be in a flowing curve merry well
was magnanimous frank harry poppy and all them rather muggy harry
was going eastward and the remainder the party westward it was
halfpast one in the morning the weather had cleared up as their brains
had been getting foggy
tom proposed a rattler
frank harry swore by the bacchanalian divinity they might ride in
the rumbletumble if they liked but none it for him and began to
stammer out
how sweet in the woodlands
wi with feet hound and horn
to awaken shrill hiccup echo
and taste the hiccup fresh morn
during this time having turned to the right on leaving the woolpack
instead the left they were pursuing their way down gracechurch
street in a line with london bridge without discovering their mistake
nor were they aware the situation they were in till they
reached the monument
zounds said tom we are all wrong here
all right said merrywell all right my boys go it my kidneys
bob hearing his cousin's exclamation began to make enquiries
never mind said tom we shall get housed presently i have it i
know the shop it is but seldom i get out the way so come along i
dare say we shall see some more fun yet
saying this he led the way down thames street and in a short time
introduced them to the celebrated house in darkhouse lane kept open
at all hours the night for the accommodation persons coming to
market and going off by the gravesend boats and packets early in the
morning
on entering this house nocturnal convenience a wide field for
observation was immediately opened to the mind dashall he was no
novice to the varieties character generally to be found within its
walls and he anticipated an opportunity imparting considerable
information to his cousin though somewhat clogg'd by his companions
being known however at the bar he found no difficulty in providing them
with beds which being accomplished
now said tom for a new scene in real life here we are situated at
billingsgate on the banks the thames in another hour it will be all
alive we will refresh ourselves with coffee and then look around us
but while it is preparing we will take a survey the interior button
up tie a silk handkerchief round your neck and we may perhaps escape
suspicion being mere lookers on by which means we shall be enabled
to mingle with the customers in the taproom and no doubt you will see
some rum ones
they now entered the tap or general room which exhibited an appearance
beyond the powers description
in one corner lay a sailor fast asleep having taken so much ballast onboard
as to prevent the possibility any longer attending to the log
but with due precaution resting his head on a bundle which he intended
to take on board his ship with him in the morning and apparently
well guarded by a female on each side in another was a weatherbeaten
fisherman in a guernsey frock and a thick woollen nightcap who
having just arrived with a cargo fish was toiling away time till
the commencement the market with a pipe and a pint by whose side was
seated a large newfoundland dog whose gravity countenance formed an
excellent contrast with that a man who was entertaining the fisherman
with a history his adventures through the day and who in return was
allowed to participate in the repeatedly filled pint a waterman in
his coat and badge ready for a customer and two women each having a
shallow basket for the purpose supplying themselves with fish at the
first market for the next day's sale
going to gravesend gentlemen enquired the waterman as tom and bob
took their seats near him
no was the reply
beg pardon sir thought as how you was going down and mought want a
boat that's all hope no offence
i vas down at the frying pan in brick lane yesterday said the
communicative adventurer snivelling bill and carrotty poll was therein
rum order you know carrotty poll so poll good health to you you
knows how gallows lusty she gets veil as i vas saying she had had a
good day with her fish and bang she comes back to bill you knows she's
rather nutty upon bill and according to my thinking they manages things
pretty veil together only you see as how she is too many for him so
when she comes back b tie if bill wasn't a playing at skittles
and hadn't sold a dab all day howsomever he was a winning the lush
so you know bill didn't care but my eyes how she did blow him up when
she com'd in and see'd him just a going to bowl and tip she tipp'd him
a vollopper right across the snout what made the skittles dance again
and bang goes the bowl at her sconce instead the skittles it vas
lucky for her it did not hit her for if it had i'll be d d if
ever she'd a cried buy my live flounders any more he vas at play with
sam stripe the tailor so the fleacatcher he jumps in between em
and being a piecebotcher he thought he could be peacemaker but
it wouldn't do tho he jump'd about like a parch'd pea in a
fryingpan poll called him stitch louse bid him pick up his needles
and be off bill wanted to get at poll poll wanted to get at bill and
between them the poor tailor got more stripes upon his jacket than
there is colours in a harlequin's breeches at barley fair here's
good health to you it was a bodkin to a but brandy poor snip
didn't skip out this here world into that are
and how did they settle it enquired the fisherman
i'll tell you all about it i never see'd such a b dy lark in all
my life poor sam is at all times as thin as a threadpaper and being
but the ninth part a man he stood no chance between a man and
a woman bill vas bleeding at the monk like a halfkilled hog and
carrotty moll full fire and fury vas defending herself with her
fishbasket billy vas a snivelling poll a steering and the poor
tailor in a funk thinks i to myself this here vont never do so up
i goes to poll poll says i to the devil i pitch you says
she only you know i knows poll veil enough she tried to sneak it
over me but she found as how i know'd better poll says i hold your
luff give us no more patter about this here rum rig i'll give cost
price for the fish and you shall have the money and while i was
bargaining with her d n me if bill and the tailor wasn't a milling
away in good style till stripe's wife comes in gives snivelling billy
a crossbuttock and bolted off with her fancy like as the song says
the devil took the tailor
with the broad cloth under his arm
i never laugh'd so in all my life i thought i should 
at this moment a nod from the landlord informed tom his coffee was
ready when they were ushered into the parlour
bob who had during the conversation in the other room which had
occasionally been interrupted by the snores the sleepy sailor the
giggling the girls who appeared to have him in charge and a growl
from the dog been particularly attentive to the narration this
adventure remarked that there was a peculiarity dialect introduced
which to a person coming out the country would have been wholly
unintelligible
yes replied tom almost every trade and every calling which the
numerous inhabitants this overgrown town is composed has a language
 its own differing as widely from each other as those provincials
nor is this less observable in high life where every one seems at times
to aim at rendering himself conspicuous for some extraordinary mode 
expression but come i perceive the morning is shedding its
rays upon us and we shall be able to take a survey the more general
visitors to this place extensive utility and resort already you may
hear the rumbling carts in thames street and the shrill voice the
fishwives who are preparing for a day's work which they will nearly
finish before twothirds the population leave their pillows this
market which is principally supplied by fishing smacks and boats coming
from the sea up the river thames and partly by land carriage from every
distance within the limits england and part wales is open every
morning at daylight and supplies the retailers for some miles round
the metropolis the regular shopkeepers come here in carts to purchase
 what is called the fish salesman who stands as it were between the
fisherman who brings his cargo to market and the retailer but there are
innumerable hawkers fish through the streets who come and purchase
for themselves at first hand particularly mackarel herrings
sprats lobsters shrimps flounders soles c and also cod
and salmon when in season and at a moderate rate composing an
heterogeneous group persons and characters not easily to be met with
elsewhere then said bob there is a certainty high and
exalted entertainment i should suppose the supply fish is very
considerable
the quantity fish consumed replied tom in london is
comparatively small fish being excessively dear in general and this
is perhaps the most culpable defect in the supply the capital
considering that the rivers great britain and the seas round her
coast teem with that food there are on an average about cargoes
 fish tons each brought to billingsgate and about tons
by land carriage making a total about tons and the street
venders form a sample low life in all its situations
in such indexes although small
to their subsequent volumes there is seen
the baby figure the giant mass
 things to come at large
and the language you have already heard forms a part what may be
termed cockneyism
cockneyism said bob with an inquisitiveness in his countenance
 yes continued tom cockney is universally known to be the
contemptuous appellation given to an uneducated native london
brought into life within the sound bow bell pert and conceited
yet truly ignorant they generally discover themselves by their mode 
speech notwithstanding they have frequent opportunities hearing the
best language the cause i apprehend is a carelessness every thing
but the accumulation money which is considered so important with
them that they seem at all times to be in eager pursuit it
o plutus god gold thine aid impart
teach me to catch the moneycatching art
or sly mercurial pilfering god old
thy lesser mysteries at least unfold
you will hear these gentry frequently deliver themselves in something
like the following manner
my eyes jim vat slippy walking tis this here morning i should ave
fell'd right down if so be as how i ain't catched ould a posts vere
does you thinks i ave been vy all the way to rapping vail an a top o
tower hill i seed a woman pillar'd such scouring and squeezing and
pelting with eggs ow funny
a female fruitseller will say to a lady oysterdealer law my dear
mrs melton how ar you this could morning mem the streets vil be
nice and dirty vel for my part i always likes dry wether do your
husband work at foxall still i likes to warm my could nose with a
pinch your snuff ow were obliging but come i hear the bustle 
billingsgate and you shall have a peep at the people by this time they
are all alive
bob laughed at his cousin's specimens cockney language and they
sallied forth to make further observations
it was now a fine morning the sun shone with resplendent lustre upon
all around them and danced in playful dimples on the sportive thames
there was however but little opportunity at the moment for them to
contemplate subjects this sort their eyes and ears being wholly
attracted by the passing and repassing the persons desirous to sell
or supply themselves with fish thames street was almost blocked up with
carts and the hallooing and bawling the different drivers loading
or unloading formed an occasional symphony to the continual hum
 those who were moving in all directions to and from the market
by yer leaf said a sturdy built fellow sweating under a load fish
which appeared to press him almost down what the devil do you stand in
the way for
bob in stepping on one side to make room for this man to pass
unfortunately trod upon the toe an hibernian lady who was bearing
away a large basket shrimps alive and at the same time gave her arm
so forcible a jerk with his elbow as disengaged her hand from the load
by which means the whole cargo was overturned smack into the bosom a
smartly dressed youth in white ducks who was conducting some ladies
on board one the gravesend boats the confusion that followed is
scarcely to be conceived the agitation tale who at hearing the
vociferated lamentations the irish woman the spluttering the
disconcerted dandy the declaration the owner the shrimps that
so help her god he should pay for her property the loud laughter 
those around them who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment the whole
party and the shrimps hopping and jumping about amid the dirt and slush
 the pavement while the ladies were hunting those which had fallen
into the bosom their conductor formed a scene altogether which
in spite the confusion his cousin almost convulsed the hon tom
dashall with laughter and which served but to increase the rancour 
the owner the shrimps and the poor toesuffering irishwoman the
execrations the dandy gentleman and his ladies and the miseries 
poor bob to escape from which he gave the hibernian and her employer
enough to purchase plaster for the one and a fresh cargo for the other
and seizing tom by the arm dragged him away from the scene his
misfortunes in fishery
illustration pages real life at billingsgate
their progress however was presently impeded by a sudden scream which
appeared to come from a female and drew together almost all the people
on the spot it seemed as if it had been a preconceived signal for a
general muster and it was quickly ascertained that fiftycuffs were the
order the day by the vociferations the spectators and the loud
acclamations go it poll pitch it into her mill her snatched veil
done sail all pluck game to the backbone peppermint her
upperstory and grapple her knowledgebox d n my eyes but that
vas a good one it has altered her weathercock and shifted her
wind there's your dairies stand out the way upon my sole you have
overturned all my flounders d n you and your dabs too
tom and bob took up a favourable position for observation at the corner
 a fishstall where they could quietly witness the combatants and
take a general survey the proceedings
now said tom here is a lark for you a female fight
fine salmon or cod gentlemen said an elderly woman i wish i could
tempt you to be customers
well said bob they are at it in good earnest
o yes said the woman we always have it in real earnest no sham i
wish poll may serve her out for sall is a d d saucy b h at
all times
and what have they quarrelled about inquired dashall
jealousy sir nothing else that there man in the nightcap with the
red ruff round his neck is sail's fancy man and he sometimes lets
her have a cargo fish for services done and performed you
understand and so sail she comes down this morning and she finds poll
having a philos with him that's all but i wish they would go and
have it out somewhere else for it spoils all business dance go and
get us a quartern jacky that i may ax these gentlemen to drink for
its a cold morning and perhaps they are not used to be up so early
tom saw the drift this in a moment and taking the hint supplied the
needful to dance who was dispatched for the heartcheering beverage
which they could perceive was in high reputation by those around them
the effluvia the fish the fumes tobacco and the reviving
scent the ginbottle rendered their olfactory salutations truly
delightful nor could they escape the fishwife without becoming
participators in the half pint blue ruin
come said tom we will now stroll a little further and take a
survey the street but first we will give a look here
this said he is the custom house a splendid building recently
erected in consequence the old one being demolished by fire in
 it is indeed replied bob admiring the south front
which is executed in portland stone
do you observe continued tom the central compartment which
comprises what is called the long room and which we will visit
presently is quite plain except the attic which is elegantly
ornamented that altorelievo contains allegorical representations 
the arts and sciences as connected with and promoting the commerce
and industry the nation that to the west a representation 
the costume and character the various nations with whom we hold
intercourse in our commercial relations in the centre under the large
massive dialplate are inscribed in large bronze letters the names 
the founders and the date its erection the figures which support
the dial in a recumbent position are emblematical industry and
plenty that bold projection in the centre gives a suitable character
to the king's warehouse and forms an appropriate support to the
imperial arms upheld by the attributes ocean and commerce
bob gazed with admiration and delight on this truly admirable and
extensive pile national architecture the gentle breeze from the
river the occasional dash the oar and the activity which appeared
on board the different vessels together with the view london bridge
on one side over which he could perceive pedestrians and vehicles
 various kinds passing and repassing and the tower on the other
conspired to heighten and give a most imposing effect to the scene
the designs said tallyhoho are truly creditable to the taste and
science the architect
and this quay in front is intended to be enlarged by filling up a part
 the river besides which a new wall and quay are to be formed from
the tower to billingsgate and numerous other improvements are projected
in the contiguous streets and lanes not before it is necessary was
the reply it would be impossible continued dashall to visit all
the apartments this building contains we will however have a look
at the long room and as we proceed i will endeavour to give you some
further information we are now entering the east wing which is a
counterpart that on the west having like this a grand staircase
with a double flight steps which conduct to a lobby at each 
 the long room lighted by these vertical lanternlights the
ceilings being perforated in square compartments and glazed these
lobbies serve to check the great draughts air which would otherwise
flow through the room if it opened directly from the staircase
they now entered the long room the imposing appearance which had its
due effect upon tallyhoho
bless me cried he in a state ecstasy this is a room to boast 
indeed
yes replied his cousin there is not such another room in europe it
is feet long by wide and proportionably high divided into
three compartments by these eight massive pillars from which as you
perceive spring the three domes which are so richly ornamented and
ventilated through the centre each
and all stone inquired bob
not exactly so was the reply the floor excepting the situation
 the officers and clerks is stone but the walls and ceilings are
drawn out and tinted in imitation
and what are these antique pedestals for merely ornaments
tom was pleased at this inquiry and with a smile satisfaction
replied no these pedestals do double duty and are something like
what the rural poet goldsmith describes in his deserted village
the chest contriv'd a double debt to pay
a bed by night a chest drawers by day
these are ornamental during the summer but useful in the winter they
contain fireplaces completely hid from view
fireplaces reechoed bob
yes continued his cousin the smoke descending passes through the
piers on each side and by their means a sufficient warmth is at all
times kept up in the room
that is a capital contrivance said tallyhoho
then to prevent the possibility sustaining any serious injury from
fire on the ground one and two pair stories the communication is cutoff
by means iron doors which run on wheels in chase in the centre
 the walls and are moved backward and forward by a windlass
which doors are closed every evening and would effectually prevent
a communication beyond their boundaries fireproof rooms also as
repositories for valuable books and papers are provided on each
floor where the important documents the establishment are deposited
every evening and removed in trunks to the respective offices there
are in all rooms devoted to various offices this however is the
principal here the general business is transacted particularly for all
foreign concerns both inwards and outwards the ship master first makes
the report the cargo here the entries which either for payment
 duties warehousing or subsequent exportation are all passed with
the respective officers in this room the business the customs is
managed by nine commissioners whose jurisdiction extends over all
parts england we will now pass out at the west wing adjourn to yon
tavern refresh and refit and after which a further walk
with all my heart said tallyhoho
what ho master b said dashall saluting the landlord as he
entered the tavern how does the world wag with you send us some soda
water the newspaper let somebody clean our boots give us pen ink and
paper and prepare us some breakfast with all speed but no fish mind
that
the landlord bowed assent to his honourable customer and by the time
they were ready their orders were complied with
pray inquired dashall the obliging landlord who came in to ask if
they were supplied with all they wished for did you ever recover anything
from that dashing blade that so obligingly ordered his dinner
here
never got a halfpenny no no he was not one those sort 
gentry nor do i ever wish to see such again in my house
this was uttered in a tone discontent which evidently shewed he had
no relish for the conversation
dashall could not refrain from laughter upon perceiving which the
landlord withdrew with a loud slam the door and left his customers
to enjoy their mirth
what are you laughing at cried bob
why continued his cousin
there was as fame reports in days yore
at least some fifty years ago or more
a pleasant wight on town 
 and there are many pleasant fellows now to be met with but you
shall have the tale as i had it this house has been celebrated for
furnishing excellent dinners and the cookery fish in particular
consequently it has been the resort the bucks the bloods and the
dashing swells the town and i myself have been well entertained
here it will therefore not be wondered at that its accommodations
should attract the notice a sharper whose name and character were
well known but who was in person a total stranger to the unsuspecting
landlord whom however he did not fail to visit
calling one afternoon for the purpose seeing how the land lay in
high twig and fashionably dressed he was supplied with a bothered into a spacious
apartmentparticularly elegant being unincumbered the ceiling
finished in a superior style and decorated with paintings the late
king and queen james the second lord sandwich lord howe and mr
pitt here bob wandered from portrait to portrait examining the
features and character each and admiring the skill and ability 
the artists at the upper the room he was additionally pleased
to find a large painting containing a group about twentyfour 
the elder brethren representing them at full length attended by their
secretary the late mr court many the persons being well remembered
by dashall were pointed out by him to his cousin and brought to his
recollection names deservedly celebrated though now no more this
picture was the gift the merchant brethren in 
tallyhoho was much delighted with his survey this truly elegant
building and the luminous account given by his cousin 
the various persons whose portraits met his eye or whose names and
characters connected with the establishment had become celebrated for
scientific research or indefatigable industry
it will occupy too much time this morning said dashall to visit
the interior the tower as i have dispatched a ticketporter to
piccadilly ordering my curricle to be at tom's coffeehouse at one we
will therefore defer that pleasure to the next opportunity being this
way we will however take a look at the bank and the exchange then a
trundle into the fresh air for an hour and return home to dinner so
come along but we will vary our walk by taking another road back
with this intention they now crossed tower hill and turned to the
left along the minores
here is a place said dashall well known and no doubt you have
often heard sparrow corner and rosemary lane are better known by
the appellation rag fair it is a general mart for the sale 
secondhand clothes and many a welllooking man in london is indebted
to his occasional rambles in this quarter for his appearance the
business this place is conducted with great regularity and the
dealers and collectors old clothes meet at a certain hour the
afternoon to make sales and exchanges so that it is managed almost upon
the same plan as the royal exchange only that the dealers here come
loaded with their goods which must undergo inspection before sales can
be effected while the merchant carries with him merely a sample or
directs his purchaser to the warehouse where his cargo is deposited the
principal inhabitants this place are jews and they obtain supplies
from the numerous itinerant collectors from all quarters london and
its suburbs whom you must have observed parading the streets from the
earliest hour the morning crying ould clothes clothes sale 
it surely can hardly be a trade worth following said talltho
there are many hundreds daily wandering the streets however replied
tom in pursuit castoff apparel rags and metals different
sorts or at least pretend so the jews are altogether a set traders
i do not mean to confine my observations to them only because there
are persons other sects employed in the same kind business and
perhaps a more dangerous set cheats could scarcely be pointed
at as their chief business really is to prowl about the houses and
stables people rank and fortune in order to hold out temptations
to their servants to pilfer and steal small articles not likely to be
missed which these fellows are willing to purchase at about onethird
 their real value it is supposed that upwards these
depraved itinerants among the jews are daily employed in journeys 
this kind by which means through the medium base money and other
fraudulent dealings many them acquire property with which they open
shops and then become receivers stolen property the losses thus
sustained by the public being almost incalculable
for wit coot gould rings copper gilt tis so he gets his
bread
wit his sealingvax brickdust and his pencils without lead
it is estimated that there are from fifteen to twenty thousand jews in
the metropolis and about five or six thousand more stationed in the
great provincial and seaport towns in london they have six synagogues
and in the country places there are at least twenty more most the
lower classes those distinguished by name german or dutch jews
live principally by their wits and establish a system mischievous
intercourse all over the country the better to enable them to carry
on thenfraudulent designs in every way the pliability their
consciences is truly wonderful
for they never stick at trifles if there's monies in the way
nay i remember the time when they used to perambulate our streets
openly professing to purchase base coin by bawling any bad shilling
any bad shilling the interference the police however has prevented
the calling though perhaps it is impossible to prevent a continuance
 the practice any more than they can that utterance these men
hesitate not to purchase stolen property or metals various kinds as
well as other articles pilfered from the dockyards and stolen in
the provincial towns which are brought to the metropolis to elude
detection and vice versa in some cases there are contrivances that
the buyer and seller shall not even see each other in order that no
advantage may be taken by giving information as to the parties 
upon my life the contrivances london are almost incomprehensible
said bob and might deter many from venturing into it but this
surprises me beyond any thing
it is however too lamentably true continued tom for these people
educated in idleness from the earliest infancy acquire every debauched
and vicious principle which can fit them for the most complicated arts
 fraud and deception to which they seldom fail to add the crime 
perjury whenever it can be useful to shield themselves or their friends
from the punishment the law totally without moral education and
very seldom trained to any trade or occupation by which they can earn an
honest livelihood by manual labour their youths excluded from becoming
apprentices and their females from engaging themselves generally
as servants on account the superstitious adherence to the mere
ceremonial their persuasion as it respects meat not killed by
jews nothing can exceed their melancholy condition both as it regards
themselves and society thus excluded from the resources which other
classes the community possess they seem to have no alternative
but to resort to those tricks and devices which ingenuity suggests
to enable persons without an honest means subsistence to live in
idleness
the richer jews are in the practice lending small sums to the poorer
classes their community in order that they may support themselves by
a species petty traffic but even this system contributes in no
small degree to the commission crimes since in order to render
it productive to an extent equal to the wants families who do not
acquire any material aid by manual labour they are induced to resort to
unlawful means increasing it by which they become public nuisances
from the orangeboy and the retailer seals razors glass and other
wares in the public streets or the collector 
old rags old jags old bonnets old bags
to the shopkeeper dealer in wearing apparel or in silver and gold
the same principles conduct too generally prevail
the itinerants utter base money to enable them by selling cheap to
dispose their goods while those who are stationary with very few
exceptions receive and purchase at an under price whatever is brought
them without asking questions and yet most their concerns
are managed with so much art that we seldom hear a jew being hanged
and it is also a fact that during the holidays which they have many
in the course a year or at one their weddings you may seethe
barrowwoman yesterday decked out in gay and gaudy attire an
expensive nature
by this time they had reached the top the minores and were turning
down houndsditch we are now said dashall close to another place
chiefly inhabited by jews called duke's place where they have a very
elegant synagogue which has been visited by royalty the present king
having during his regency honoured them with a visit through the
introduction the late mr goldsmith if it should be a holiday we
will be present at the religious ceremonies the morning with this
they entered duke's place and were soon within the walls this temple
 judaism in taking a view it bob was much gratified with its
splendid decorations and without being acquainted with their forms had
doffed his castor but was presently informed by his cousin that he
must keep his hat on the readers appeared to him to be singers but the
whole the service being hebrew it was little consequence to him
whether read or sung he perceived during the performances these
prayers which were every now and then joined in by almost everyone
present that many the congregation appeared to be in close
conversation which however was taken no notice by the persons
officiating he was well pleased with the singing a youth and the
accompaniment a gentleman in a cock'd hat for although he could not
discover that he actually produced words he produced sounds in many
instances bearing a strong similarity to those a bassoon the
venerable appearance and devotion the high priest who was habited ina
robe white also attracted his attention while the frequent bursts
 the congregation joining in the exercises the morning in some
instances almost provoked his risibility
the religious ceremonies these people said tom as they left the
synagogue though somewhat imposing as to form and appearance do not
seem to be strongly interesting for many them are engaged during the
whole the service in some species traffic buying and
 doffed his castor taken off his hat
 selling or estimating the value goods for sale they are such
determined merchants and dealers that they cannot forget business even
in the house prayer we have two sets them this is the dutch
synagogue but the most ancient is that the portuguese having been
established in england ever since the usurpation the members it
being mostly wealthy are extremely attentive to their poor among whom
there is said not to be a single beggar or itinerant while the dutch or
german jews get no education at all even the most affluent them are
said to be generally unable either to read or write the language the
country that gave them birth they confine themselves to a bastard or
vulgar hebrew which has little analogy to the original they observe
the particular ritual the german synagogue and also include the
polish russian and turkish jews established in london with the
exception a few wealthy individuals and as many families who are in
trade on the royal exchange they are in general a very indigent class
 people their community being too poor to afford them adequate
relief they have resorted to the expedient lending them small sums
 money at interest to trade upon which is required to be repaid
monthly or weekly as the case may be otherwise they forfeit all claim
to this aid
the portuguese jews are generally opulent and respectable and hold
no community with the others they use a different liturgy and their
language is even different they never intermarry with the jews the
dutch synagogue they pride themselves on their ancestry and give their
children the best education which can be obtained where they reside the
brokers upon the exchange the jewish persuasion are all or chiefly
 the portuguese synagogue their number is limited to twelve by act 
parliament and they pay guineas each for this privilege
they had now reached the houndsditch when passing through
bishopsgate church yard and broad street they were soon at the bank
this building said dashall covers an extent several acres 
ground and is completely isolated
its exterior replied bob is not unsuited to the nature 
the establishment as it certainly conveys an idea strength and
security
 that's true continued tom but you may observe a want 
uniformity design and proportion arising from its having been
erected piecemeal at different periods and according to different
plans by several architects this is the principal entrance and
opposite to it is the shortest street in the metropolis called bank
street it contains but one house now we will take a survey the
interior
they entered the hall where tallyhoho was much pleased to be instructed
as to the methodical way they have examining notes for a reissuing
or exchanging into coin
here said dashall are the drawingoffices for public and private
accounts this room is seventynine feet long by forty and at the
further you observe a very fine piece sculpture that is a
marble statue king william iii the founder the bank thi national
establishment was first incorporated by act parliament in the
projector the scheme was a mr james paterson a native 
scotland and the direction its concerns is vested in a governor
deputygovernor and twentyfour directors elected annually at a
general court the proprietors thirteen the directors with the
governor form a court for the transaction business the bank is open
every day from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon holidays
excepted it is like a little town the clerks at present are about
 in number but a reduction is intended the rotunda is the most
interesting apartment we will go and have a look at the moneydealers
here continued he as they entered the rotunda and mingled among
the various persons and sounds that are so well known in that seat
 traffic from the hours eleven to three a crowd eager
moneydealers assemble and avidity gain displays itself in
evervarying shapes at times truly ludicrous to the disinterested
observer you will presently perceive that the rustling and crowding
 the jobbers to catch a bargain frequently exceed in disorder the
scrambling at the doors our theatres for an early admission and sa
loud and clamorous at times are the mingled noises the buyers and
sellers that all distinction sound is lost in a general uproar
 this description tallyhoho had an absolute proof in a few
minutes for the mingling variety voices appeared to leave no
space in time for distinguishing either the sense or the sound the
individual speakers though it was evident that notwithstanding the
continual hubbub there was a perfect understanding effected
between parties for the sale and transfer stock according to the
stipulations bargained for
ha mr m said the hon tom dashall how do you do
happy to say well sir thank you was the reply any
commands markets are pretty brisk this morning and we are all alive
pray said tallyhoho who is that extraordinary looking lady with such
red lips and cheeks beneath the garb sadness
a constant visitor here replied mr m i may say a day scarcely
passes without her being present
she has a curious appearance said bob her dress is all black
from head to foot and yet her cheeks disclose the ruddy glow 
uninterrupted health is it that her looks belie her garb or that her
garb belies her looks
hush said mr m let her pass and i will give you some information
relative to her which if it does not gratify you will at least
satisfy some your inquiries i am half inclined to believe that allis
not right in the seat government with her pointing his finger to
his head and she is therefore rather deserving pity than an object
 censure or ridicule though i have reason to believe she frequently
meets with attacks the latter when in search the sympathy and
benefit to be derived from a proper exercise the former her name is
miss w her father was formerly a twopenny postman who resided
at rockingham row walworth and was himself somewhat eccentric in his
dress and manners and it was not at all unusual to meet him in
the morning in the garb his office though decidedly against his
inclination and to see him on change during change hours in silk
stockings and in every other way dressed as a merchant attending
there according to custom and practice and he managed by some means
or other to keep up a character respectability and to give an
accomplished education to the younger branches this family so that
this lady though unfortunate in her present circumstances has been
well brought up and mingled in polished society and if
you were to enter into conversation with her now you would find
her intelligent in the selection her words and the combination 
sentences to explain to you the most improbable events and the most
unheard claims that she has upon all the governments in the known
world this however would be done with good temper unless any thing
like an insulting observation should be conceived or intended to be
conveyed
and pray what is supposed to be the cause her present manners and
appearance inquired bob
it is principally attributed replied mr m to the circumstance 
losing a beloved brother who she now continually declares is only kept
from her by the persons who daily visit the rotunda with a view
to prevent the recovery the property she lays claim to and the
particulars which she generally carries in her pocket that brother
however suffered the penalty the law for a forgery but this she
cannot be induced to believe
 the lamentable effusion blood which has taken place
within the last twenty years in consequence forgeries on
the bank england has already excited a very considerable
portion public interest and indignation and it is much
to be feared that notwithstanding the very serious expence
the corporation have incurred with a view to remedy the
evil by rendering the imitation more difficult the
anticipated result is not likely to be obtained it will
hardly be conceived that the governors have expended as much
as one hundred thousand pounds in this laudable undertaking
and upon producing an impression we are told it can be
imitated by one who within three weeks produced a facsimile
and puzzled the makers the original note to
discover which was the workmanship their own hands nay
even an engraver on wood is said to have produced an
excellent imitation in a few hours it is however sincerely
to be hoped that an effectual stop will be eventually put to
the possibility committing this crime which we
apprehend nine times out ten brings the poor needy
halfstarved retailer paper to the gallows while the
more unprincipled wholesale dealer escapes detection
while on the subject forged notes we cannot help
deprecating the circulation what are termed flash
notes which if not originally intended to deceive and
defraud are calculated to accomplish these objects when in
the hands the artful and designing we think there is a
tradesman in the vicinity the bank who presents such 
his customers as visits his repository to have their hair
cut c with a hash note purporting to be for and we
have also reason to believe that more than one attempt has
been detected where the parties have really endeavoured to
pass them as valid bank england paper the danger
therefore must be evident
 we have reason to think she is frequently much straitened for
want the necessary supplies for sustenance and she has temporary
relief occasionally from those who knew her family and her former
circumstances in life while she boldly perseveres in the pursuit 
fancied property and the restoration her brother
i have heard her make heavy complaints the difficulties she has had
to encounter and the privations she has been subjected to but her own
language will best speak the impressions on her mind here is a printed
letter which was circulated by her some time ago
to the worthy inhabitants the parish st mary lexington surrey
it is with feelings deep regret i have to deplore the necessity that
compels me to adopt a public measure for the purpose obtaining my
property from those gentlemen that hold it in trust for a period ten
years i have endured the most cruel and unjustifiable persecution which
has occasioned the premature death my mother a considerable loss 
property all my personal effects apparel and valuables has exposed
me to the most wanton and barbarous attacks the greatest insults and
the severe and continual deprivation every common necessary having
made every appeal for my right or even a maintenance without effect
i now take the liberty adopting the advice some opulent friends in
the parish and solicit general favour in a loan by subscription for a
given time not doubting the liberal commiseration many ladies
and gentlemen towards so great a sufferer as it is not possible to
describe the wrongs i have endured the misery that has been heaped upon
me in so limited a space i shall be happy to give every explanation
upon calling for the result this entreaty and to those ladies and
gentlemen that condescend to favour

for the truth this statement or the real existence any property
belonging to her i am not able to vouch she is well known in all
the offices this great establishment is generally peaceable in
her conduct and communicative in her conversation which at times
distinguishes her as a person good education
hard is the fortune which your sex attends women like princes find

the conversation was here interrupted by the arrival a gentleman
who taking mr m on one side tom and bob wished him a good morning
they proceeded to view the various offices which branch out
from the rotunda and which are appropriated to the management each
particular stock in each which bob could not help admiring the happy
disposition every department to facilitate business the arrangement
 the books and the clerks under the several letters the alphabet
he conceived was truly excellent
the corporation the bank said dashall are prohibited from
trading in any sort goods or merchandize whatsoever but are to
confine the use their capital to discounting bills exchange and
to the buying and selling gold and silver bullion with a permission
however to sell such goods as are mortgaged or pawned to them and not
redeemed within three months after the expiration the time for their
redemption their profits arise from their traffic in bullion the
discounting bills exchange for bankers merchants factors and
speculators and the remuneration they receive from government for
managing the public funds and for receiving the subscriptions on loans
and lotteries but we may ramble about in these places for a month and
still have novelty in store and there is a little world underneath the
greater part this extensive building devoted to printingoffices
warerooms c
they had now reached the door which leads into bartholomew lane and
upon descending the steps and turning to the left bob's eyes soon
discovered the auction mart what have we here inquired he
that replied his cousin is a building which may deservedly be
rank'd as one the ornaments the city and its arrangements and
economy as well as the beauty its interior are well deserving the
notice every stranger this fine establishment which serves as a
focus for the sale estates and other property by public auction is
both useful and ornamental it was built about the time when the spirit
 combination was so strong in london you must know some years back
every kind business and trade appeared likely to be carried on by
joint stock companies and the profits divided upon small shares many
fireoffices have to date their origin from this source the hope the
eagle the atlas and others the golden lane brewery was opened
upon this principle some water companies were established till
neighbourhood and partnership almost became synonymous and i
believe among many other institutions that kind the building before
us is one it contains many handsome rooms and commodious offices but
as for offices every street and every alley abounds with them and
nowadays if you want to hire a cook or a scullion you have nothing
to do but to send a letter to a registeroffice and you are suited ina
twinkling it was an excellent idea and i remember the old buck who
used to call himself the founder establishments that nature or
rather the first introducer them to the notice englishmen poor
old courtois
john courtois is said to have been a native picardy where he was
born about the year or he repaired to this country while yet
young in the character valet de chambre to a gentleman who had
picked him up in his travels and as he came from one the poorest
 the french provinces he took root and throve wonderfully on his
transplantation to a richer soil
on the death his master he removed to the neighbourhood the
strand and st martin's street leicester square became the scene 
his industry and success at a time when wigs were worn by boys and a
frenchman was supposed the only person capable making one fit for
the grande monarque he commenced business as a perruquier and
soon acquired both wealth and celebrity to this he joined another
employment which proved equally lucrative and appropriate as it
subjected both masters and servants to his influence this was the
keeping a registeroffice one the first known in the metropolis
whence he drew incalculable advantages he is also said to have been a
dealer in hair which he imported largely from the continent and yet
after all it is difficult to conceive how he could have realized a
fortune exceeding l but what may not be achieved by a man who
despised no gains however small and in his own expressive language
considered farthings as the seeds guineas
the following appears to be a true description this very
extraordinary man whom we ourselves have seen more than once old
courtois was well known for more than half a century in the purlieus 
st martin's and the haymarket his appearance was meagre and squalid
and his clothes such as they were were pertinaciously got up in
exactly the same cut and fashion and the colour always either fawn or
marine for the last thirty years the venerable chapeau was uniformly
 the same cock the principal feat however in which this fervent
votary plutus appeared before the public was his nearly fatal affair
with mary benson otherwise mrs maria theresa phepoe in april 
this illfatedwoman projected a rather bungling scheme in order
to frighten her old acquaintance and visitor courtois out a
considerable sum money one evening when she was certain his
calling she had her apartment prepared for his reception in a species
 funereal style a bier a black velvet pall black wax candles
lighted c no sooner had the friend entered the room than the lady
assisted by her maid pounced on him forced him into an arm chair
in which he was forcibly held down by the woman while the hostess
brandishing a caseknife or razor swore with some violent imprecations
that instant should be his last if he did not give her an order on his
banker for a large sum money the venerable visitor alarmed at the
gloomy preparations and dire threats the desperate female asked for
pen ink and paper which being immediately produced he wrote a check
on his banker for two thousand pounds he immediately retired with
precipitation happy to escape without personal injury the next
morning before its opening he attended at the banker's with some
policeofficers and on mrs phepoe's making her appearance with the
check she was arrested and subsequently tried at the old bailey on a
capital charge grounded on the above proceedings however through
the able defence made by her counsel the late mr fielding who took a
legal objection to the case as proved and contended that she never
had or obtained any property mr courtois on the principle that
possession constituted the first badge ownership she was only
sentenced to twelve months imprisonment
some years since the late lord gage met courtois at the courtroom 
the east india house on an election business ah courtois said his
lordship what brings you here to give my votes my lord was the
answer what are you a proprietor most certainly and more
votes than one yes my lord i have four aye indeed why
then before you take the pray be kind enough to pin up my curls
with which modest request the proprietor four votes equal to ten
thousand pounds immediately complied
m courtois married a few years since and has left several children
on reflecting that his widow's thirds would amount to an immense sum
with his usual prudence he made a handsome settlement on her during
his lifetime as his sons were not very economical habits he has
bequeathed them small annuities only and vested the bulk his fortune
in trustees on behalf his daughters who are infants
until his death he invariably adhered to the costume the age in
which he was born a threecocked hat and a plumcoloured coat
both rather the worse for wear in which we have seen him frequently
invariably designated his person and habits while a penurious economy
that bid defiance to all vulgar imitation accompanied him to his grave
his death occurred in in the seth or syst year his age
such characters observed tallyhoho notwithstanding their
eccentricity afford useful lessons to those who in this giddy and
dissipated age devote a part their time to thinking
no doubt it replied dashall they furnish examples what maybe
done by perseverance and determination and almost seem to verify the
assertion that every one may become rich if he pleases but come we
must move towards tom's coffee house in our way to which we will
pass through the royal exchange which lies directly before us it was
originally a brick building erected by sir thomas gresham in the year
 but being destroyed by the fire london in the present
building portland stone was raised in its place the first stone
 which was laid by charles in in consequence which his
statue has been placed in the centre its quadrangle around which the
merchants assemble daily to transact their commercial businesses
 the merry monarch was fond the citizens and frequently
honoured the lord mayor's table with his presence it is
said him that on retiring to his carriage one day after
dining with the civic sovereign he was followed by the
latter who with a freedom inspired by the roseate deity
laid hold his majesty by the arm and insisted that he
should not go until he had drunk t'other bottle the monarch
turned round and goodhumouredly repeating a line from an
old song the man that is drunk is as great as a king
went back to the company and doubtless complied with the
lord mayor's request
 it has two principal fronts one in cornhill and the other
which you now see is at the threadneedle street each which
has a piazza affording a convenient shelter from the sun and rain
it is open as a thoroughfare from eight in the morning till six in the
evening but the hours in which business is chiefly transacted are from
two to five its extent is feet by 
by this time they had passed the gate and bob found himself in a
handsome area with a fine piazza carried entirely round and furnished
with seats along the four walks for merchants different nations who
meet each at their different stations and was immediately attracted
by the appearance the numerous specimens art with which it was
adorned
do you observe said his cousin within these piazzas are
twentyeight niches all vacant but that in which is placed a statue 
sir thomas gresham in the northwest angle and that in the southwest
which presents a statue sir john barnard magistrate the city and
one its representatives in parliament those smaller statues in the
niches the wall the quadrangle in the upper story are the kings
and queens england beginning with edward i on the north side and
ending with his late majesty on the east as far as charles i they were
executed by gabriel cibber the various frames which are placed around
under the piazza contain the names residences and occupations 
tradesmen mechanics and others the grand front in cornhill has
been under repair lately and in its appearance no doubt is greatly
improved the steeple which is just raised is a handsome dome
surmounted by the original grasshopper rendered somewhat celebrated by
a prophecy that certain alterations would take place in men manners
and times when the grasshopper on the top the exchange should meet
the dragon at the top bow church and strange and extraordinary as it
may appear this very circumstance is said to have taken place as
they have both been seen in the warehouse some manufacturer to
whom they were consigned for repair in addition to which if
crockery's relation the transmogrifications england is to
be believed the prophecy is in a considerable degree a whimsical and
laughable burnett in one act has recently been produced at the royal
coburg theatre in which mr sloan sings with admirable comicality
the following song alluded to by the hon tom dashall to the tune 
o the roast beef old england
from hinge i came with my master o dear
but lunnun is not like the same place that's clear
it has nigh broke my heart since i have been here
o the old times old england
o dear the good english old times
the town is so changed that i don't know a spot
the times are so hard there's no work to be got
and for porter they charges you tippence a pot
o the old times c
then the sides the houses are stuck full bills
about blacking mockauctions and wonderful fills
but for von wot they cures a hundred they kills
o the old times c
there's the names are all altered brewer i goes
and the people all laughs at the cut my close
the men are turn'd women the belles are turn'd beaux
o the old times c
even i vent out to hinge if any von died
a good wooden coffin they used to provide
but iron sons now keeps the poor worms outside
o the old times c
there's the lancaster schools now all over the land
wot teaches the children to scribble on sand
and a ugly bonassus wot lives in the strand
o the new times c
there's a new lifepreserver with rich you cant drown
and a new kind sovereigns just com'd into town
von is worth a pound note and the other a crown
o the new times c
the playbills have hard words wot i cannot speak
and the organs plays nothing but latin and greek
and it's rain'd every day now for more than a week
o the new times c
there's a man walks on vater and don't vet his feet
and a patent steamkitchen wot cooks all your meat
and epp's ham and beef shop in every street
o the new times c
i walks up and down with the tears in my hye
wot they once call'd a waggon is now call'd a fly
and the boys points their fingers and calls i aguy
o the old times old england
o dear the good english old times
there is a staircase in each front and one on each side which
lead to a gallery above running round the whole building containing
the offices various establishments but i believe in the original
plan shops were intended to fill the building to the top at present
the upper rooms are occupied by lloyd's celebrated subscription
coffeehouse for the use underwriters and merchants by the royal
exchange insurance company and various offices individuals there
are also the gresham lecture rooms where lectures are read pursuant to
the will the late sir thomas gresham who bequeathed to the city 
london and the mercers company all the profits arising from these and
other premises in cornhill in trust to pay salaries to four lecturers
in divinity astronomy music and geometry and three readers in civil
law physic and rhetoric who read lectures daily in term time
this we may consider the grand mart the universe where congregate
those sons commerce the british merchants who in dauntless extent
 enterprise hold such distinguished preeminence
tallyhoho viewed the scene before him with an inquisitive eye and was
evidently wrapped in surprise at the busy hum men all actuated
by one universal object the acquisition wealth the spacious area
exhibited a mass mercantile speculators numerously grouped in
conversation under the piazzas appeared a moving multitude in like
manner engaged while the surrounding seats were in similar occupation
dashall and bob the many hundreds individuals present were
perhaps the only two led to the place by curiosity alone
tallyhoho who on every occasion doubtful dilemma looked to his
cousin dashall for extrication expressed his surprise at the appearance
 a squalid figure whose lank form patched habiliments and unshorn
beard indicated extreme penury in familiar converse with a
gentleman fashionably attired and demeanour to infer unquestionable
respectability
interest said tallyhoho supersedes every other consideration else
these two opposites would not meet
your observation is just replied his cousin the tatterdemallion to
whom you allude is probably less impoverished than penurious perhaps
 miserly habits and in other respects disqualified for polite
society what then he is doubtless in ample possession the essential
requisite and here a monied man only is a good man and without money
no man can be respectable
here the continued and deafening noise a handbell rung by one
 the exchangekeepers underlings perched on the balcony over the
southern gate interrupted mr dashall's remarks it was the signal for
locking up the gates and inferring at the same time obedience to the
summons with due promptitude and submission on pain being detained
two hours in dress vile
sufficient alacrity egression not having been shown the keepers
closed the two gates and at the same time locked the east and western
avenues thus interdicting from egress above three hundred contumacious
individuals including the hon tom dashall and his cousin
a considerable time having now elapsed without any prospect 
enlargement dissatisfaction gained ground apace and shortly ripened
into actual mutiny the disaffected now proceeded to hold a council 
war and after a few moments deliberation it was resolved unanimously
to storm the avenues dashall and
 some years ago a gentleman extensive property residing in the
country was desirous raising by way loan on the security 
landed estates the sum l his solicitor in london with whom
he had corresponded on the subject summoned him at last to town a
lender was found who was to meet the solicitor at a certain time and
place appointed in the neighbourhood the exchange the borrower
on the day and near the hour fixed upon was in the area the royal
exchange when there crossed over a wretched looking being the very
personification misery the gentleman unsolicited gave the poor
object a shilling on going to the appointed rendezvous how great was
his astonishment to find in the person the wealthy monied man the
identical receiver his bounty ha ha cried he you shall not
fare the worse for your generosity and actually advanced the money
on terms much easier than expected this personage was the celebrated
daniel dancer
 tallyhoho declined taking any part in the enterprise they took a
right view the affair they were mere casual visitants not likely
ever again to suffer a similar restraint while the others were in the
daily practice transacting business on the spot to them therefore
the frequent recurrence the present disaster might happen theirs
then was the cause as being most particularly interested
an attack was made by the prisoners upon the portals opening into bank
buildings and sweeting's rents but the former having been shattered
sometime since on a similar occasion and subsequently very strongly
repaired it was found impregnable at least to any immediate exertion
 force and being neither furnished with a park artillery nor with
the battering ram the ancients the little army faced to the right
about enfiladed the area and took up a new position in due order 
assault against the door the avenue leading into sweeting's rents
the affair was decided and without bloodshed the bars soon bent before
the vigour the assailants one these was taken into custody by a
beadle but rescued and the attack recommenced with success when the
opposite door was also opened by the shopkeeper living in that avenue
and the exchange was finally cleared at four minutes past five o'clock
after above an hour's detention including the time occupied in storming
the avenues
the triumph liberty was now complete the intrepid phalanx disbanded
itself and our heroes having made the farewell cone to their
victorious compeers proceeded into cornhill where dashall espying
his curricle at the door tom's coffee house they after refreshing
themselves took a cheerful country drive over london bridge clapham
common wandsworth c from which they returned at six o'clock to
dinner determined to have a night's rest before they proceeded in
search further adventures
chapter xxi
happy the man who void cares and strife
in silken or in leathern purse retains
a splendid shilling he nor hears with pain
new oysters cried nor sighs for cheerful ale
but i whom griping penury surrounds
and hunger sure attendant upon want
with scanty offal and small acid tiff
wretched repast my meagre corse sustain
or solitary walk or dose at home
in garret vile
talking over at the breakfasttable the occurrences the preceding
day on my conscience exclaimed tallyhoho were the antediluvian
age restored and we daily perambulated the streets this immense
metropolis during a hundred years to come i firmly believe that every
hour would bring a fresh accession incident
ad infinitum answered dashall where happiness is the goal in
view and fifteen hundred thousand competitors start for the prize the
manoeuvres all in pursuit the grand ultimatum must ever exhibit an
interesting and boundless variety london
 the needy villain's general home
the common sewer paris and rome
where ingenious vice too frequently triumphs over talented worth where
folly riots in the glare luxury and merit pines in indigent
obscurity allons donc another ramble and chance may probably
illustrate my observation
take notice said the discriminating dashall to his friend as they
reached the mall in st james's park that solitary knight the
woeful countenance his threadbare raiment and dejected aspect denote
disappointment and privation ten imperial sovereigns to a plebeian
 shilling he is either a retired veteran or a distressed poet
the object curiosity who had now seated himself appeared to have
attained the age fifty or more a bat that had once been
black a scantskirted blue coat much the worse for wear a striped
waistcoat his lank legs and thighs wrapt in a pair something
resembling trowsers but a world too wide for his shrunk shanks short
gaiters shoes in the last stage consumption whiskers full
dimensions his head encumbered with an unadjusted redundancyof grey
hair such were the habiliments and figure this son adversity
the two friends now seated themselves on the same bench with the
stranger who absorbed in reflection observed not their approach
the silence the triumvirate was broken in upon by tom who with his
usual suavity manners politely addressed himself to the unknown
on the common topic weather et cetera without eliciting in reply
more than an assenting or dissenting monosyllable you have seen some
service sir
yes
in the army i presume
no
under government
yes
in the navy probably
no
i beg your pardon continued dashall my motives originate not in
idle inquisitiveness if i can be any service 
the stranger turned towards him an eye inquiry i ask not from
impertinent curiosity resumed dashall neither would i wish
indelicately to obtrude an offer assistance perhaps equally
unnecessary as unacceptable yet there are certain liabilities life
wherein sympathy may be allowed to participate
sir said the other with an immediate grateful expansion mind and
freedom communication i am inexpressibly indebted for the honour
 your solicitude and feel no hesitation in acknowledging that i ama
literary writer but so seldom employed and when employed so
inadequately requited that to me the necessaries life are frequently
inaccessible
 here tallyhoho interrupted the narrator by asking whence it
was that he had adopted a profession so irksome them both a hearty welcome arrah what mane
you by a preposterous exhibition by becky the warm hearts the sons
and daughters st patrick have exhibited an unsophisticated feeling
 loyalty very opposite indeed to the chilling indifference not to
say worse it those his subjects at home and as sir william the
big baronet the city said in the house that gives laws to the
land why should not his majesty be cheered up a little
this effusion loyalty was well received and dashall and his cousin
cordially united in the general expression approbation
this is a vera weel said the northern but an overstrained civility
wears ay the semblance o suspicion and fulsome adulation canna be vera
acceptable to the mind o delicate feeling for instance there is
my ain country and a mair ancient or a mair loyal to its legitimate
sovereign there diana exist on the face o the whole earth wad the king
condescend to honor wi his presence the palace o holyrod house he
wad experience as ardent a manifestation o fidelity to his person and
government in auld reekie as that shown him in dublin though violins
no quite sae tumultuous forbye it wadna hae been amiss to hae gain
the preference to a nation whare his ancestors held sway during sae mony
centuries and whare in the castle edinburgh is still preserved the
sacred regalia with which it nigh no hae been apropos to hae graced
his royal head and hand amidst the gratifying pageantry o a scotch
coronation sure i am that north britain has never been honored publicly
wi a royal visit whether ony branch o the present reigning family
hae been there incognita they best ken themselves
you seem to have forgot observed tallyhoho the visit the duke 
cumberland to scotland in the year 
begging your pardon for setting you right in that particular answered
the cynic with a most significant expression countenance that
sir was not a visit but a visitation
appropriate enough whispered dashall to tallyhoho
augh moderation to nice distinctions exclaimed o'shaughnessy here
mister settler be after tipping over anode half quartern the cratur
wit which to drink success to the royal visitant
and that the company may participate in the gratifying expression 
attachment to their sovereign landlord said dashall let the glass
go round
testifying our regard for the sovereign resumed the northern it
canna be understood that we include a the underlings o government we
ought as in duty bound to venerate and obey the maister o the house
bat it is by no means necessary that we should pay a similar
respect to his ox and his ass his manservant and his maidservant
may be had he been at hame on a late occasion o melancholy solemnity
blood wadna hae been spilt and mickle cool and sorrow wad hae been
avoided
we perfectly understand your allusion said one from the group 
lifeguardsmen us now present there were none implicated in the
unfortunate occurrences either that day or a subsequent one yet we
must not silently hear our comrades traduced perhaps then it may be as
well to drop the subject
i canna think o relinquishing a topic discourse answered the
northern replete wi mickle interest merely at your suggestion it
may be ye did your duty in obeying the commands on that lamentable
occasion o your superior officers and it is to be hoped that the duty
o the country towards those with whom originated the mischief will
not be forgotten there is already on record against the honour your
corps a vera serious verdict
here the lifeguardsmen spontaneously started up but the immediate
interposition dashall averted me impending storm while tallyhoho
imitating the generosity his cousin ordered the circulation once
more the bottle to unanimity betwixt the military and the people
harmony thus restored the two friends took their leave amidst the
grateful acknowledgments the company o'shaughnessy swearing on
their departure that doubtless the two strangers were begot in ireland
although they might have come over to england to be born while the
pertinacious northern observed that appearances were after deceitful
although to be sure the twa friends had vera mickle the manners 
perfectly wellbred gentlemen and seem'd forbye to hae a proper sense
o national honor
proceeding into whitehall tallyhoho much admired the statuelike figures
 the mounted sentries in the recesses by the gate the horseguards
the relief had just approached the precision retirement the one
party and advance to its post the other the interesting appearance
 the appropriately caparisoned and steady demeanour the horses
and their instinctive knowledge military duty excited deservedly
prolonged attention
 one would think said tallyhoho that these noble animals are
really actuated by reasoning faculties
hereafter replied dashall you will still more incline to this
opinion when we have an opportunity being present on a cavalry
fieldday in hyde park where manoeuvre will appear to have attained its
acme perfection as much from the wonderful docility the horse as
the discipline the riderl
but hold who have we here our friend sparkle gazing about him with
an eye inquisitive incertitude as if in search lost property
as his two friends approached he seemed bewildered in the labyrinth
 conjecture i have lost my horse he exclaimed in answer to the
inquiry dashall having occasion to stop half an hour at drummond's
i gave the animal in charge an israelite urchin and now neither are
to be seen
casting a look down the street they at last discerned the jew lad
quickly yet carefully leading the horse along with two boys mounted on
its back thoroughly instructed in the maxim get money honestly if
you can but get it by any means young moses had made the most the
present opportunity by letting out the horse at a penny a ride from
charing cross to the horse guards this by his own confession was
the fifteenth trip sparkle highly exasperated was about to apply the
discipline the whip to the shoulders the thrifty speculator when
tallyhoho interceding in his behalf he was released with a suitable
admonition
 not long since some cavalry horses deemed unfit for
further service were sold at tatters's one these
a miller happened to be the purchaser subservient now to
the ignoble purposes burthen the horse one day was
ledwith a sack flour on his back to the next markettown
there while the miller entered a house for a few
moments and the animal quietly waited at the door a
squadron dragoons drew up in an adjacent street forming
by sound trumpet the instant that the miller's horse
heard the wellknown signal it started off with as much
celerity as its burthen admitted and to the great
amusement the troop and astonishment the spectators
took its station in the ranks dressing in line with the
accustomed precision an experienced veteran in the
service and it was with considerable difficulty that the
miller who had now hastened to the spot could induce the
animal to relinquish its military ardour to which it still
appeared to cling with renewed and fond pertinacity
sparkle mounting his recovered charger left his pedestrian
friends for the present to continue their excursion who proceeding up
st martin's lane and admiring that noble edifice the church reached
without other remarkable occurrence the quietude leicester square
close by is barker's panorama an object attraction too prominent to
be passed without inspection they now entered and tallyhoho stood mute
with delight at the astonishing effect the perspective while as if
by the powers enchantment he seemed to have been transported into
other regions amidst scenes rich sublimity in the centre a vast
amphitheatre bounded only by the distant horizon far remote from the
noisy bustle the metropolis he gave full scope to his imagination
and after an hour pleasing reverie left the fascinating delusion
with evident reluctance
emerging once more into the gay world the two associates in search
 real life in london proceeded through covent garden market where
fruit flowers and exotic in profusion invite alike the eye and the
appetite
onwards they reached the classic ground drury where catherine
street descends into the strand
i never said the hon tom dashall pass this spot without a feeling
 veneration the scenes olden times rise on my view and the
shades garrick and our late loss and not less illustrious
sheridan flit before me this was then as now the seat cyprian
indulgence the magnet sensual attraction where feminine youth and
beauty in their most fascinating and voluptuous forms were let out by
the unprincipled procuress and the shrines venus and apollo invited
the votaries each to nocturnal sacrifice
 the avenue to the boxes drury lane theatre was in the
time garrick through vinegar yard in this passage an
old spider better known perhaps by the name a
procuress had spread her web alias opened a bagnio and
obtained a plentiful living by preying on those who
unfortunately or imprudently fell into her clutches those
who are not unacquainted with haddocks will understand the
loose fish alluded to who beset her doors and accosted
with smiles or insults every one that passed it happened
that a noble lord in his way to the theatre with his two
daughters under his arm was most grossly attacked by this
band flaming ministers he immediately went behind the
scenes and insisted on seeing mr garrick to whom he
represented his case and so roused the vengeance the
little manager that he instantly full wrath betook
himself to this unholy sybil
twinchild caius vulcan was their sire full offspring
both healthiness fume and fire
finding her at the mouth her cavern he quickly gave veut
to his rage in the most buskin'd strain and concluded by
swearing that he would have her ousted to this assault she
was not backward in reply but soon convinced him that she
was much more powerful in abusive language than our roscius
though he had recourse in his speech to milton's hellborn
bitch and other phrases similar celebrity whilst she
entirely depended on her own natural resources those to
whom this oratory is not new have no need our reporting
any it and those to whom it is a perfect mystery boast
a state the more gracious and are the more happy in their
ignorance none this rhapsody however although teeming
with blasphemy and abuse had any effect on garrick and he
would have remained unmoved had she not terminated in the
following manner which so excited the laughter the
collected mob and disconcerted the soul richard
that without another word to say he hastily took shelter
in the theatre putting her arms akimbo and letting down
each side her mouth with wonderful expression 
contempt she exclaimed you whipper snapper you oust me
you be d d my house is as good as your's aye and
better too i can come into your's whenever i like and
see the best that you can do for a shilling but dme if
you or any body else shall come into mine for less than a
fifteenpenny negus
 this street and neighbourhood was wont to exhibit nightly
a melancholy proof early infamy here might be seen a prolonged
succession juvenile voluptuaries females many them under
fourteen years age offering themselves to indiscriminate
prostitution in a state verging on absolute nudity alluring the
passengers by every seductive wile to the haunts depravity from
which retreat was seldom effected without pecuniary exaction and
frequently accompanied by personal violence the nuisance has been
partly abated but entirely to remove it would be a task more
difficult accomplishment than that cleansing the augean stable and
would baffle all the labours hercules
this fact observed tallyhoho throws an indelible stain on
metropolitan police
not so answered his companion scarce a day passes without groups 
these unfortunates being held before a magistrate and humanely disposed
 in various ways with the view preventing a recurrence to vicious
habits but in vain the stain is more attributed to the depraved
nature man who first seduces and then casts off to infamy
and indigence the unhappy victim credulity many these wretched
girls would in all probability gladly have abstained from the career
 vice if on their first fall they had experienced the consoling
protection parents or friends but shut out from home exiled from
humanity divested character and without resources no choice is
left other than mendicity or prostitution
the sombre reflections occasioned by these remarks gradually gave way to
those a more enlivening hue as the two friends proceeded along the
strand the various display at the tradesmen's shop windows useful
and ornamental articles the continued bustle the street the
throng passengers every description hurrying on in the activity
 business or more leisurely lounging their way under the impulse 
curiosity the endless succession new faces and frequent occurrence
 interesting incident these united in forming an inexhaustible fund
 amusement and admiration
 hatton garden on saturday no less than fifteen
unfortunate girls all elegantly attired were placed at the
bar charged by caddy the streetkeeper on the foundling
estate with loitering about the neighbourhood for their
nocturnal purposes the constable stated that repeated
complaints had been made to him by many the inhabitants
 the disgraceful practice vast numbers frail ones
who resort every night to brunswick square he had been
therefore instructed to endeavour to suppress the nuisance
about twelve o'clock on friday night while perambulating
the district he found the fifteen prisoners at the bar in
brunswick square at their usual pursuits and all them
were in the act picking up gentlemen he procured
assistance and they were taken into custody and conveyed
to the watchhouse
none the prisoners could deny the charge but expressed
great contrition at being under the painful necessity 
procuring their subsistence in so disgraceful a manner they
were examined individually by the magistrates as to the
origin that brought them to disgrace some from their
admission were farmers daughters and had been decoyed
from their relatives and brought to london and
subsequently deserted by their seducers some were nurserymaids
others girls seduced from boarding schools their
tales were truly distressing some had only been six months
in such infamy others twelve months and some two years and
upwards
the worthy magistrate with much feeling admonished them on
the evil course they were following and pointed out the
means still left for them to return to the paths virtue
and on their severally promising never to appear again in
that quarter they were discharged
passing through temple bar once more said dashall we enter
the dominions another sovereign the moderation being partly occupied by clamorous
butchers with whom this street abounds to redundancy the poet had no
other alternative than that inviting the respectable visitants to
his attic or as the landlord facetiously named the lofty domicile his
first floor down the chimney
real life in london must be seen to be believed the hon tom dashall
and his friend tallyhoho were reared in the lap luxury and never
until now formed an adequate conception the distressing privations
attendant on suffering humanity
with a dejection spirits evidently occasioned by the humiliating
necessity ushering his polished friends into the wretched asylum 
penury the poet led the way with tardy reluctancy while his visitors
regretted every step ascent under the appalling circumstance 
giving pain to adversity yet they felt that to recede would be more
indelicate than to advance
the apartment which they now entered seemed a lumber room for the
reception superfluous or unserviceable furniture containing not
fewer than eleven decayed and mutilated chairs varied description
and the limited space to make the most it in a pecuniary point 
view was encroached upon by three uncurtained beds most
impoverished appearance while exhibiting the ravages time in
divers fractures the dingy walls and ceiling retouched by the trowel
in many places with a lighter shade repairing material bore no unapt
resemblance to the pyebald horse in chigwellstreet calculating on its
utility and probable future use the builder the mansion had given
to this room the appendage a chimney but evidently it had for many
years been unconscious its usual accompaniment fire two windows had
originally admitted the light heaven but to reduce the duty one
was internally blocked up while externally uniformity was preserved a
demolished pane glass in the remaining window close to which stood
a small dilapidated table gave ingress to a current air the
convenient household article denominated a clotheshorse stood against
the wall and several parallel lines cord were stretched across the
room on which to hang wet linen a garret being considered free
access to all the house and the comfort or health its occupant held
in utter derision and contempt
here then
in the worst inn's worst room with cobwebs hung
the walls plaster and the floors dung
entered dashall and his cousin tallyhoho the latter familiarly seating
himself on the rickety remains what had once been an armchair but
now a cripple having lost one its legs the precarious equilibrium
gave way under the unaccustomed shock the contact and the squire
came to the ground to his no small surprise the confusion the poet
and amusement dashall
with many apologies for the awkwardness their very humble
accommodation and grateful expression thanks for the honour
conferred upon him the poet replaced tallyhoho in a firmer seat and a
silence some few moments ensued the two friends being at a loss in
what manner to explain and the poet unwilling to inquire the object 
their visit
dashall began at last by observing that in pursuit the knowledge 
real life in london he and his accompanying friend had met with many
incidents both ludicrous and interesting but that in the present
instance their visit was rather influenced by sympathy than 
curiosity and that where they could be serviceable to the interest 
merit in obscurity they always should be happy in the exercise a
duty so perfectly congenial with their feelings
many years had elapsed since the person to whom these remarks were
addressed had heard the voice consolation and its effect was
instantaneous his usual sombre cast countenance became brightened by
the glow cheerful animation and he even dwelt on the subject his
unfortunate circumstances with jocularity
the elevated proximity a garret he observed to the sublimer
regions has often been resorted to as the roost genius and why
should i the most slender if any literary pretensions complain
and yet my writings scattered amongst the various fugitive periodical
publications this and our sister island if collected together would
form a very voluminous compilation
i have always understood said bob that the quality not the
quantum constituted the fame an author's productions
true sir answered the poet and i meant not the vanity 
arrogating to myself any merit from my writings with reference either
to quantum or quality i alluded to the former as merely proving the
inefficacy mental labour in realizing the necessaries life to an
author whom celebrity declines acknowledging similarly situated it
would appear was the dutchman mentioned by the late doctor walcot
my broder is te poet look
as all te world must please
for he heb wrote py got a 
so big as all this cheese
on the other hand collins hammond and gray wrote each them but
little yet their names will descend to posterity and had gray his
poems the bard and the elegy in a country church yard written
only one and written nothing else he had required no other or better
passport to immortality
 that great and multitudinous writer doctor samuel
johnson the following anecdote is told being one morning
in the library at buckingham house honoured with the
presence royalty the king his late majesty inquired
why he mr johnson did not continue to write may it
please your majesty answered the doctor i think i have
written enough i should have thought so too his
majesty replied if doctor johnson you had not written so
well
 in this opinion the visitants who were both well conversant with
our native literature readily acquiesced
have you never asked dashall thought publishing a volume by
subscription
i meditated such intention answered the poet not long ago drew
up the necessary prospectus with a specimen the poetry and
perambulated the metropolis in search patronage in some few
instances i was successful and though limited the number yet the high
respectability my few subscribers gave me inexpressible satisfaction
several our nobility honoured me with their names and others my
patrons were the very first class literature nevertheless
i encountered much contumelious reception and after an irksome
and unavailing perseverance a month's continuance i was at last
compelled to relinquish all hope success
having then on my list the name a very worthy alderman who lately
filled the civic chair with honour to himself and advantage to his
fellowcitizens i submitted my prospectus in an evil hour to another
alderman a baronet this here and that there notoriety
waiting in his bankinghouse the result my application he
condescended to stalk forth from the holy holies his inner room
with the lofty demeanour conscious importance when in the presence
 his clerks and others doubtless to their great edification and
amusement the following colloquy ensued bearing in his hand my unlucky
prospectus with a respectful epistle which had accompanied it
are you the writer he asked in a magisterial tone this here
letter
i am sir wm unfortunately
then he continued you may take them there papers back again i have
no time to read prospectuses and so mister poet my compliments and
good morning to you
these literally were his words and such was the astounding effect they
produced on my mind that although i had meant to have passed through
the royal exchange i yet in the depth my reverie wandered i knew
not where and before recovering my recollection found myself in the
centre london bridge
 the detail this fact so characteristic rude ungentlemanly
manners and the barbarian ignorance this great man little soul
excited against him with dashall and his friend a mingled feeling 
ridicule contempt and reprobation
real life in london still exclaimed talltho intellect and indigence
in a garret and wealth and ignorance in a bankinghouse i would
at least have given him in deficiency other means the wholesome
castigation reproof
i did said the poet stung to the quick by such unmerited contumely
i retired to my attic and produced a philippic named the recantation
i cannot accommodate you at present with a copy the poem but the
concluding stanzas i can repeat from memory
cs thy house in lombard street
affords thee still employment meet
thy consequence retaining
for there thy partners and thy clerks
must listen to thy sage remarks
subservient uncomplaining
and rob'd in aldermanic gown
with look and language all thy own
thou mak'st thy hearers stare
when this here cause so wisely tried
thou purest with selfapplause aside
to wisely try that there
nor can thy brother its forget
when thou at civic banquet sate
and ask'd heaven a boon
a toast is call'd on thee all eyes
intent when peals laughter rise
a speedy peace and soon
nor yet orthography nor grammar
vain effort on thy pate to hammer
impregnable that fort is
witness thy toast again three cs
for who would think that thou by these
meant cox and king and curtis
cs though scant thy sense yet heaven
to thee the better boon hast given
or wealth then sense despise
and deem not fate's decrees amiss
for still where ignorance is bliss
tis folly to be wise
 bravo exclaimed dashall reissue your prospectus my friend
and we will accelerate with our best interest and influence the
publication your volume let it be dedicated to the hon tom dashall
and his cousin bob tallyhoho in the meanwhile accept this trifle as a
complimentary douceur uniformly given on such occasions and amidst
the varied scenes real life in london i shall frequently recur to
the present as the most gratifying to my feelings
by this the sun was out sight
and darker gloaming brought the night
the benevolent associates now departed pleased with the occurrences 
the day and more than all with the last wherein the opportunity
was afforded them extending consolation and relief to genius in
adversity
chapter xxii
mark
he who would cut the knot that does entwine
and link two loving hearts in unison
may have man's form but at his birth be sure on't
some devil thrust sweet nature's hand aside
ere she had pour'd her balm within his breast
to warm his gross and earthly mould with pity
i know what tis
when worldly knaves step in with silver beards
to poison bliss and pluck young souls asunder
tom and his cousin were surprised the next morning by a visit from
mr mortimer and his friend merrywell whose dismal features and long
visages plainly indicated some unpleasant disaster and tom began to
fear blame would be attached to them for leaving his party at warehouse
lane
pray said merrywell can you tell me where to find your friend
sparkle
indeed replied dashall a little relieved by this question i am not
sparkle's keeper but pray be seated what is the matter is it a duel
do you want a second i know he is a good shot
this levity sir said mortimer is not to be borne the honour a
respectable family is at stake and must be satisfied no doubt you
as his very oldest friend know where he is and i desire you will
immediately inform me or 
sir said dashall who was as averse as unused to be desired by any
person do you know whom you address and that i am in my own house
if you do you have certainly discarded all propriety conduct and
language before you cross'd the threshold
gentlemen said merrywell perhaps some explanation is really
necessary here my friend mortimer speaks under agonized feelings
for which i am sure your good sense will make every allowance miss
mortimer 
miss mortimer exclaimed dashall rising from his seat you
interest me strongly say what miss mortimer
alas said mortimer evidently endeavouring to suppress emotions which
appeared to agitate his whole frame and absorb every mental faculty
we are unable to account for her absence and strongly suspect she is
in company with your friend sparkle can you give us any information
relative to either them
dashall assured them he knew nothing the fugitives but that he
would certainly make every inquiry in his power if possible to find
out sparkle upon which they departed though not without hinting they
expected tom had the power making a search more effectually than
either mortimer or merrywell
egad said tom to tallyhoho this absence sparkle means something
more than i can at present conceive and it appears that we must
now venture forth in search our guide i hope he has taken a good
direction himself
mortimer appears hurt continued bob and i can scarcely wonder at
it
it is a trifle in high life nowadays replied dashall and my life
for it we shall obtain some clue to his mode operation before the
day is out love is a species madness and oftentimes induces
extraordinary movements i have discovered its existence in his breast
for some time past and if he is really with the lady i wonder myself
that he has not given some sort intimation though i know he is very
cautious in laying his plans and very tenacious admitting too many
persons to know his intentions for fear some indiscreet friend
unintentionally frustrating his designs
i apprehend we shall have a wildgoose chase it rejoined bob
it serves however continued tom to diversify our peregrinations
and if it is his pleasure to be in love we will endeavour to chase
pleasure in pursuit the lover and if guided by honourable motives
which i cannot doubt we will wish him all the success he can wish
himself only regretting that we are deprived his agreeable company
still free as air the active mind will rove
and search out proper objects for its love
but that once fix'd tis past the pow'r art
to chase the dear idea from the heart
tis liberty choice that sweetens life
makes the glad husband and the happy wife
 but come let us forth and see how the land lies many persons
obtain all their notoriety from an elopement it makes a noise in the
world and even though frequently announced in our newspapers under
fictitious titles the parties soon become known and are recollected
ever after and some even acquire fame by the insertion a paragraph
announcing an elopement in which they insinuate that themselves are
parties so that an elopement in high life may be considered as one 
the sure roads to popularity
but not always a safe one replied bob
life is full casualties rejoined dashall and you are by
this time fully aware that it requires something almost beyond human
foresight to continue in the line safety while you are in pursuit 
real life in london though it may fairly be said that all the world's
a stage and all the men and women merely passengers still they have
their inside and their outside places and each man in his time meets
with strange adventures it may also very properly be termed a camera
obscura reflecting not merely trees signposts houses c but
the human heart in all its folds its feelings its passions and its
motives in it you may perceive conceit flirting its fan arrogance
adjusting its cravat pedantry perverting its dictionary vacuity
humming a tune vanity humming his neighbour cunning shutting his eyes
while listening to a pedagogue and credulity opening his eyes and ears
willing and anxious to be deceived and duped
it is a strange world indeed said tallyhoho and all that i have
ever heard or seen this london your's is the most extraordinary
part
yes
this world is a wellcover'd table
where guests are promiscuously set
we all eat as long as we're able
and scramble for what we can get 
answered his cousin in fact it is like every thing and at the same
time like nothing 
the world is all nonsense and noise
fantoccini or ombres chinoises
mere pantomime mummery
puppetshow flummery
a magical lantern confounding the sight
like players or puppets we move
on the wires ambition and love
poets write wittily
maidens look prettily
till death drops the curtain
all's over good night
by this time they were at long's where upon inquiry all trace 
sparkle had been lost for two days all was mystery and surprise not so
much that he should be absent as that his servant could give no account
 him which was rather extraordinary tom ascertained however that
no suspicion appeared to have been excited as to miss mortimer and
with commendable discretion avoided expressing a word which could
create such an idea merely observing that most likely he had taken an
unexpected trip into the country and would be heard before the day
was out
on leaving long's however they were met again by mortimer in breathless
anxiety evidently labouring under some new calamity
i am glad i have found you said he addressing himself to dashall
for i am left in this d d wilderness a place without a friend
to speak to
how inquired ton what the d l is the matter with you
why you must know that merry well is gone 
gone where to
to to zounds i've forgot the name the people but two genteel
looking fellows just now very genteel told him he was wanted and must
come
indeed
yes and he told me to find you out and let you know that he must
become a bencher and without more toto walked away with his new
friends leaving me forlorn enough my sister run away my uncle run
after her sparkle absent and merrywell 
in the hands the nabmen i see it all clear enough and you have
given a very concise but comprehensive picture your own situation
but don't despair man you will yet find all right be assured put
yourself under my guidance let the world wag as it will it is useless
to torment yourself with things you cannot prevent or cure
the right life is to live and be jolly
 mortimer scarcely knew how to relish this advice and seemed to
doubt within himself whether it was meant satirically or feelingly till
dashall whispered in his ear a caution not to betray the circumstances
that had transpired for his sister's sake but continued he i
never suffer these things which are by no means uncommon in london
to interfere with my pursuits though we are all somewhat at a loss
however as the post is in by this time some news may be expected and
we will call at home before we proceed any further where do you think
the colonel is gone to
heaven only knows replied mortimer the whole family is in an uproar
 surmise and alarm what may be the it i know not
a pretty breeze master sparkle has kick'd up indeed continued tom
but i have for some time noticed an alteration in him he always was
a gay trump and whenever i find him seriously inclined i suspect
some mischief brewing for rapid transitions always wear portentous
appearances and your serious files are generally sly dogs my life
for it they have stolen a march upon your uncle queered some country
parson and are by this time snugly stowed away in the harbour 
matrimony as for merrywell i dare be sworn his friends will take care
 him
expectation was on tiptoe as dashall broke the seal a letter that
was handed to him on arrival at home mortimer was on the fidget and
tallyhoho straining his neck upon the full stretch anxiety to hear
the news when dashall burst into a laugh but in which neither the
others could join in consequence not knowing the cause it in a
few minutes however the mystery was in some degree explained
here said tom is news extraordinary news an official dispatch
from headquarters but without any information as to where the tents
are pitched it is but a short epistle he then read aloud
dear dashall
please inform the mortimer family and friends that all's well
your's truly
c sparkle
then handing the laconic epistle to mortimer i trust said he you
will now be a little more at ease
 mortimer eagerly examined the letter for the postmark but was
not able to make out from whence it came
i confess said he i am better satisfied than i was but am yet at
a loss to judge the motives which have induced them to pursue so
strange a course
the motive cried tom that may be easily explained and i doubt
not but you will find although it may at present appear a little
mysterious sparkle will be fully able to shew cause and produce effect
he is however a man honour and property and most likely we may by
this time congratulate you upon the change your sister's name what
a blaze it will make and she will now most certainly become a sparkling
subject hang it man don't look so dull upon a bright occasion
to prove pleasure but pain some have hit on a project
we're duller the merrier we grow
exactly the same unaccountable logic
that talks cold fire and warm snow
for me born by nature
for humour and satire
i sing and i roar and i quaff
each muscle i twist it
i cannot resist it
a finger held up makes me laugh
for since pleasure's joy's parent and joy begets mirth
should the subtlest casuist or sophist on earth
contradict me i'd call him an ass and a calf
and boldly insist once for all
that the only criterion pleasure's to laugh
and sing tol de rol loi de rol lol
this mirth dash all's did not seem to be in consonance with the
feelings mortimer who hastily took his departure
come said tom to his cousin having gained some information
respecting one friend we will now take a stroll through temple bar and
have a peep at merrywell he may perhaps want assistance in his present
situation though i will answer for it he is in a place perfect
security
how said bob what do you mean
mean why the traps have nibbled him he is arrested and gone to a
lockup shop a place mere accommodation for gentlemen to take up
their abode for the purpose arranging their affairs and
where they can uninterruptedly make up their minds whether to give
bail put in appearance and defend the suit or take a trip to abbott's
priory become a three months student in the college art and
undergo the fashionable ceremony whitewashing
i begin to understand you now said bob and the only difference
between our two friends is that one has willingly put on a chain for
life 
and the other may in all probability continued tom have to chaff his
time away with a chum perhaps not quite so agreeable though it really
is possible to be very comfortable if a man can reconcile himself to
the loss liberty even in durance vile
by this time they were walking leisurely along piccadilly
and marching without any cumbersome load
they mark'd every singular sight on the road
who is that meagre looking man and waddling woman who just passed us
inquired tallyhoho
an old bencher was the reply there you see all that is left a
man haut ton one who has moved in the highest circles but alas
bad company and bad play have reduced him to what he now is he has cut
up and turn'd down very well among the usurers and attornies but it is
impossible to say him as his sirloin a wife for she cannot be
called a rib or at all events a spare rib that there is any thing like
cut and come again the poor wornout exquisite tack'd himself to his
lady to enable him to wipe out a long score and she determined on
taking him for better for worse after a little rural felicity in a walk
to have her fortune told by a gipsy at wormwood he is now crippled in
pocket and person and wholly dependent upon bounty for the chance 
prolonging a miserable existence his game is up but what is life but a
game at which every one is willing to play one wins and another loses
why there have been as many moves among titled persons kings queens
bishops lords and knights within the last century as there are in a
game at chess pawns have been taken and restored in all classes
from the sovereign who pawns or loses his crown to the lady whose
reputation is in pawn and becomes at last not worth half a crown
shuffling cutting dealing out and dealing in double dealing
and double faces have long been the order the day some men's cards
are all trumps whilst others have carte blanche some honours count
whilst others stand for nothing for instance did not the little man
who cast up his final accounts a short time back at st helena like a
corsican conjurer shuffle and cut about among kings and queens knaves
and asses aces i mean dealing out honours when he liked and taking
trumps as he thought fit did he not deal and take up again almost ashe
pleased having generally an honour in his sleeve to be played at
command or un roi dans le marche by which cheating it was scarcely
possible for any one to get fair play with him till flushed by
success and not knowing how to bear his prosperity he played too
desperately and too long the tables were turned upon him and his
enemies cheated him first his liberty and ultimately his life
at this moment tallyhoho who was listening in close attention to his
cousin struck his foot against a brown paper parcel which rolled before
him hallo exclaimed he what have we here somebody has dropped a
prize
it is mine sir said an old woman dropping them a curtsey with a
smile which shone through her features though thickly begrimed with
snuff
a bite said tom
i dropp'd it from my pocket sir just now
and pray inquired tom what does it contain picking it up
snuff sir was the reply a kind goodhearted gentleman gave it tome
god bless him and bless your honour too with an additional smile
and a still lower curtsey
upon examining the paper which had been broken by the kick tom
perceived that by some magic or other the old woman's snuff had become
sugar
zounds said he they have played some trick upon you and given you
brimstone instead snuff or else you are throwing dust in our eyes
the parcel which contained a sample sugar was carefully rolled up
again and tied then dropped to be found by any body else who chose to
stoop for it
this said dashall does not turn out to be what i first expected
for the practices ring and money droppings have at various
times been carried on with great success and to the serious injury
 the unsuspecting the persons who generally apply themselves to this
species cheating are no other than gamblers who ingeniously contrive
by dropping a purse or a ring to draw in some customer with a view to
induce him to play and notwithstanding their arts have frequently been
exposed we every now and then hear some flat being done by these
sharps and indeed there are constantly customers in london to be had
one way or another
then you had an idea that that parcel was a bait this kind
rejoined bob
i did replied his cousin but it appears to be a legitimate letter
from some industrious mechanic to his friend and is a curious specimen
 epistolary correspondence and you perceive there was a person ready
to claim it which conspired rather to confirm my suspicions being a
little in the style the gentry i have alluded to they vary their
mode proceeding according to situation and circumstance your
moneydropper contrives to find his own property as if by chance
he picks up the purse with an exclamation hallo what have we
here zounds if here is not a prize i'm in rare luck today ha
ha ha let's have a peep at it it feels heavy and no doubt is worth
having while he is examining its contents up comes his confederate
who claims a share on account having been present at the finding
nay nay replies the finder you are not in it this gentleman is
the only person that was near me was not you sir by this means the
novice is induced to assent or perhaps assert his prior claim the
finder declares
 the practice ringdropping is not wholly confined to
london as the following paragraph from the glasgow courier
a very short time ago will sufficiently prove on monday
afternoon when three highland women who had been employed
at a distance from home in the harvest were returning to
their habitations they were accosted by a fellow who had
walked out a short way with them till he picked up a pair
 earrings and a key for a watch the fellow politely
informed the females that they should have half the value 
the articles as they were in his company when they were
found while they were examining them another fellow came
up who declared at once they were gold and worth at least
thirty shillings after some conversation the women were
induced to give fifteen shillings for the articles and came
and offered them to a watchmaker for sale when they
learned to their mortification that they were not worth
eighteen pence
 that sooner than have any dispute about it he will divide the
contents in three parts recommends an adjournment to a publichouse in
the neighbourhood to wet the business and drink over their good luck
this being consented to the leading points are accomplished the
purse course is found to contain counterfeit money flashscreens or
fleetnotes and the division cannot well be made without change can
be procured now comes the touchstone the countryman for such they
generally contrive to inveigle is perhaps in cash having sold his hay
or his cattle tells them he can give change which being understood
the draughtboard cards or la bagatelle are introduced and as the
job is a good one they can afford to sport some their newlyacquired
wealth in this way they drink and play and fill their grog again the
countryman bets if he loses he is called upon to pay if he wins tis
added to what is coming to him out the purse
if after an experiment or two they find he has but little money or
fight shy they bolt that is brush off in quick time leaving him to
answer for the reckoning but if he is what they term wellbreeches
and full cash they stick to him until he is cleaned out make him
drunk and if he turns restive they mill him if he should be an
easy cove he perhaps give them change for their flash notes or
counterfeit coin and they leave him as soon as possible highly pleased
with his fancied success while they laugh in their sleeves at the dupe
 their artifice
and is it possible inquired tallyhoho
can such things be and overcome us
like a summer's cloud
not without our special wonder continued dashall but such things
have been practised then again your ringdroppers or practises 
the sawney rig are more cunning in their manoeuvres to turn their wares
into the ready blunt the pretending to find a ring being one the
meanest and least profitable exercises their ingenuity it forms a
part their art to find articles much more
 flashscreens or fleetnotes forged notes
 cleaned out having lost all your money
 easy cove one whom there is no difficulty in gulling
 ready blunt cash in hand
 value such as rich jewelry broaches earrings necklaces set
with diamonds pearls c sometimes made into a paper parcel at others
in a small neat red morocco case in which is stuck a bill parcels
giving a highflown description the articles and with an extravagant
price proceeding nearly in the same way as the moneydroppers with the
dupe the finder proposes as he is rather short seven to
swap his share for a comparatively small part the value stated in
the bill parcels and if he succeeds in obtaining onetenth that
amount in hard cash his triumph is complete for upon examination the
diamonds turn out to be nothing but paste the pearls fishes eyes and
the gold is merely polished brass gilt and altogether no value
but this cannot be discovered beforehand because the bilk is in a
hurry can't spare time to go to a shop to have the articles valued
but assures his intended victim that as they found together he should
like to smack the bit without blowing the gap and so help
him g d the thing wants no buttering up because he is willing to
give his share for such a trifle
 seven a flash term for money
 swap to make an exchange to barter one article for
another
 a swindler or cheat
 smack the bit to share the booty
 blowing the gap making any thing known
 buttering up praising or flattering
this conversation was suddenly interrupted by a violent crash just
behind them as they passed drury lane theatre in their way through
russel court and bob upon turning to ascertain from whence such
portentous sounds proceeded discovered that he had brought all the
potentates the holy alliance to his feet the alexanders the
caesar the buonaparte shakespeare addison and popes lay strewed
upon the pavement in one undistinguished heap while a poor italian lad
with tears in his eyes gazed with indescribable anxiety on the shapeless
ruin vat shall me do dat man knock him down all broke you
pay oh mine god vat shall do this appeal was made to dashall and
tallyhoho the latter whom the poor italian seemed to fix upon as the
author his misfortune in upsetting his board plaster images and
although he was perfectly unconscious the accident the appeal the
vender great personages had its desired effect upon them both and
 finding themselves quickly surrounded by spectators they gave
him some silver and then pursued their way
these men said dashall are generally an industrious and hardliving
people they walk many miles in the course a day to find sale for
their images which they will rather sell at any price than carry back
with them at night and it is really wonderful how they can make a
living by their traffic
ha ha ha said a coarse spoken fellow following how the carman
duck diddled the dandies just now did you twig how he queered the coves
out seven bob for what was not worth thrums the yelper 
did his duty well and finger'd the white wool in good style i'm
d d if he was not up to slum and he whited their wattles with
the velvet and floored the town toddlers easy enough
how do you mean said his companion
why you know that foreign blade is an ould tyke about this quarter and
makes a good deal money many a twelve does he get by buying
up broken images persons who sell them by wholesale and he course
gets them for little or nothing then what does he do but dresses out
his board to give them the best appearance he can and toddles into
the streets touting for a good customer the first genteel bit 
flash he meets that he thinks will dub up the possibles he dashes
down the board breaks all the broken heads and appeals in a pitiful
way for remuneration for his loss so that nine times out ten he gets
some johnnyraw or other to stump up the rubbish
zounds said dashall these fellows are smoking us and in the midst
 my instructions to guard you against the abuses the metropolis we
have ourselves become the dupes an impostor
 thrums a flash term for threepence
 the yelper a common term given to a poor fellow subject
who makes very pitiful lamentations on the most trifling
accidents
 white wool silver
 twelve a shilling
 touting is to be upon the sharp look out
 to dub up the possibles to stand the nonsense are nearly
synonymous and mean will pay up any demand rather than be
detained
 well said tallyhoho it is no more than a practical
illustration your own observation that it is scarcely possible for
any person to be at all times secure from the arts and contrivances 
your ingenious friends the londoners though i confess i was little in
expectation finding you as an old practitioner so easily let in
it is not much to be wondered at continued tom for here we are in
the midst the very persons whose occupations if such they may be
termed ought most to be avoided for covent garden and drury lane
with their neighbourhoods are at all times infested with swindlers
sharpers whores thieves and depredators all descriptions for ever
on the look out it is not long since a man was thrown from a twopair
 stairs window in charles street which is just by having been
decoyed into a house ill fame by a cyprian and this in a situation
within sight the very police office itself in bow street
huzza ha ha ha there he goes vociferated by a variety voices
now called their attention and put an to their conversation and
the appearance a large concourse people running up drury lane
engrossed their notice as they approached the other russel court
on coming up with the crowd they found the cause the vast assemblage
 persons to be no other than a quakers decorated with a tricoloured
cockade who was
 a circumstance a truly alarming and distressing nature
to which dashall alluded in this place was recently made
known to the public in the daily journals and which should
serve as a lesson to similar adventurers
it appeared that a young man had been induced to enter a
house ill fame in charles street covent garden by one
 its cyprian inmates to whom he gave some money in order
for her to provide them with supper that upon her return
he desired to have the difference between what he had given
and what she had expended returned to him which being
peremptorily refused he determined to leave the house on
descending the staircase for which purpose he was met by
some men with whom he had a violent struggle to escape
they beat and bruised him most unmercifully and afterwards
threw him from a twopair stairs window into the street
where he was found by the watchman with his skull fractured
and in a state insensibility we believe all attempts
have hitherto proved fruitless to bring the actual
perpetrator or perpetrators this diabolical deed to
punishment
 bowstreet thursday morning an eccentric personage who
has for some time been seen about the streets the
metropolis in the habit a quaker and wearing the tricoloured
cockade in his broad white hat made his appearance
at the door this office and presenting a large packet to
one the officers desired him in a tone authority to
lay it instantly before the magistrate the magistrate g
r minshull esq having perused this singular paper
inquired for the person who brought it and in the next
moment a young man in the garb a quaker with a broadbrimmed
peacefullooking drabcoloured beaver on his
head surmounted by a furious tricoloured cockade was
brought before him this strange anomalous personage
having placed himself very carefully directly in front 
the bench smiled complacently upon his worship and the
following laconic colloquy ensued forthwith
magistrate did you bring this letter
quaker thou hast said it
magistratewhat is your object in bringing it
quaker merely to let thee know what is going on in the
world and moreover being informed that if i came to thy
office i should be taken into custody i was desirous to
ascertain whether that information was true
magistrate then i certainly shall not gratify you by
ordering you into custody
quaker thou wilt do as seemeth right in thy eyes i assure
thee i have no inclination to occupy thy time longer than is
profitable to us and therefore i will retire whenever thou
shalt signify that my stay is unpleasant to thee
magistrate why do you wear your hat are you a quaker
quaker thou mayest it but that is not my sole motive for
wearing it to be plain with thee i wear it because i chose
to do so canst thee tell me any law which compels me
to take it off
magistrate i'll tell you what friend i would seriously
recommend you to retire from this place as speedily as
possible
quaker i take thy advice farewell
thus ended this comical conversation and the eccentric
friend immediately departed in peace
the brother the above person attended at the office on
saturday and stated that the quaker is insane that he was
proprietor an extensive farm near relate in surrey for
some years but that in may last his bodily health being
impaired he was confined for some time and on his recovery
it was found that his intellects were affected and he was
put under restraint but recovered some time since he
absconded from relate and his friends were unable to
discover him until they saw the account his eccentricities
in the newspapers mr squire was desirous if he
made his appearance again at the office he should be
detained the magistrate as a cause for the detention 
the quaker swore the brother to these facts about three
o'clock the quaker walked up bowstreet when an officer
conducted him to the presence the magistrate who
detained him and at seven o'clock delivered him into the
care his brother
 very quietly walking with a police officer and exhibiting a
caricature himself mounted on a velocipede and riding over
corruption c it was soon ascertained that he had accepted an
invitation from one the magistrates bow street to pay him a visit
as he had done the day before and was at that moment going before him
i apprehend he is a little cracked said tom but however that maybe
he is a very harmless sort person but come we have other game
in view and our way lies in a different direction to his
clothes sir any clothes today said an importunate young fellow at
the corner one the courts who at the same time almost obstructed
their passage
making their way as quickly as they could from this very pressing
personage who invited them to walk in
this said tom is what we generally call a barker i believe the
title originated with the brokers in moorfields where men this
description parade in the fronts their employers houses incessantly
pressing the passengers to walk in and buy household furniture as they
do clothes in rosemary lane seven dials field lane houndsditch and
several other parts the town ladies dresses also used to be barked
in cranbourn alley and the neighbourhood leicester fields however
the nuisance has latterly in some measure abated the shopwomen in that
part content themselves nowadays by merely inviting strangers to look
at their goods but barkers are still to be found stationed at the
doors mock auctions who induce company to assemble by bawling walk
in the auction is now on or just going to begin these mock
auctions there have been many opened an evening under the imposing
glare brilliant gas lights which throws an unusual degree lustre
upon the articles put up for sale it is not however very difficult to
distinguish them from the real ones notwithstanding they assume all the
exterior appearances genuineness even up to advertisements in the
newspapers purporting to be held in the house a person lately gone
away under embarrassed circumstances or deceased they are denominated
mock auctions because no real intention exists on the part the
sellers to dispose their articles under a certain price previously
fixed upon which although it may not be high is invariably more than
they are actually worth besides which they may be easily discovered by
the anxiety they evince to show the goods to strangers at
the moment they enter never failing to bestow overstrained
panegyrics upon every lot they put up and asking repeatedly what
shall we say for this article a better cannot be produced and
promising if not approved when purchased to change it the
auctioneer has a language suited to all companies and according to his
view a customer can occasionally jest bully or perplex him into
a purchase the goods must be sold at what they will fetch and
he declares notwithstanding among his confederates who stand by as
bidders they are run up beyond the real value in order to catch a
flat that the present bidding can never have paid the manufacturer
for his labour
in such places various articles silver plate glass and household
furniture are exposed to sale but generally made up damaged
materials and slight workmanship little intrinsic value for the
selfsame purpose as the razorseller states
friend cried the razorman i'm no knave
as for the razors you have bought
upon my soul i never thought
that they would shave
not shave quoth hodge with wond'ring eyes
and voice not much unlike an indian yell
what were they made for then you dog he cries
made quoth the fellow with a smile to sell
passing the white horse yard here continued tom in this
yard and the various courts and alleys which lead into it reside
numerous girls in the very lowest state prostitution and it is
dangerous even in the day time to pass their habitations at all
events very dangerous to enter any one them do you see the crowd
 squalid halfclad and halfstarved creatures that surround the old
woman at the corner observe that young thing without a stocking is
stealing along with a bottle in one hand and a gown in the other she is
going to put the latter up the spout with her
 up the spout or up the five are synonymous in their
import and mean the act pledging property with a
pawnbroker for the loan money most probably derived from
the practice having a long spout which reaches from the
top the house the pawnbroker where the goods are
deposited for safety till redeemed or sold to the shop
where they are first received through which a small bag is
dropped upon the ringing a bell which conveys the
tickets or duplicates to a person above stairs who upon
finding them unless too bulky saves himself the trouble
and loss time coming down stairs by more readily
conveying them down the spout
 accommodating uncle in order to obtain a little the
enlivening juice the juniper to fill the former
 uncle sometimes called the ferret or the flint cant
terms for pawnbroker though many these gentlemen now
assume the more reputable appellation silversmiths they
are willing to lend money upon all sorts articles 
household furniture linen plate wearing apparel
jewellery c with a certainty making a very handsome
profit upon the money so circulated
there are in this metropolis upwards two hundred and
thirty pawnbrokers and in some cases they are a useful and
serviceable class people and although doubtless many 
them are honest and reputable persons there are still among
them a class sharpers and swindlers who obtain licences
to carry on the business and bring disgrace upon the
respectable part the profession every species fraud
which can add to the distresses those who are compelled
to raise temporary supplies money is resorted to and for
which purpose there are abundance opportunities in many
instances however the utility these persons in
preventing a serious sacrifice property cannot be
denied for by advancing to tradesmen and mechanics
temporary loans upon articles value at a period 
necessity an opportunity redeeming them is afforded
when by their industrious exertions their circumstances are
improved many them however are receivers stolen
goods and under cover their licence do much harm to
the public indeed the very easy mode raising money by
means the pawnbrokers operates as an inducement or at
least an encouragement to every species vice the
fraudulent tradesman by their means is enabled to raise
money on the goods his creditors the servant to pledge
the property his employer and the idle or profligate
mechanic to deposit his working tools or his work in an
unfinished state many persons in london are in the habit 
pawning their apparel from monday morning till saturday
night when they are redeemed in order to make a decent
appearance on the next day in low neighbourhoods and among
loose girls much business is done by pawnbrokers to good
advantage and considerable emolument is derived from women
 the town the articles they offer to pledge are generally
 the most costly nature and the pilfering the night
are usually placed in the hands an uncle the next
morning and the wary moneylenders fully acquainted with
their necessities just lend what they please by which
means they derive a wonderful profit from the almost
certainty these articles never being redeemed
the secresy with which a pawnbroker's business is conducted
though very proper for the protection the honest and
wellmeaning part the population to shield them from an
exposure which might perhaps prove fatal to their business or
credit admits great room for fraud on the part the
moneylender more particularly as it respects the interest
allowed upon the pawns many persons are willing to pay any
charge made rather than expose their necessities by
appearing before a magistrate and acknowledging they have
been concerned in such transactions
persons who are in the constant habit pawning are
generally known by the pawnbrokers in most instances
governed by their will and compelled to take and pay just
what they please again much injury arises from the want 
care in the pawnbroker to require a proper account from the
pledgers the manner in which the goods offered have been
obtained as duplicates are commonly given upon fictitious
names and residences
notwithstanding the care and attention usually paid to the
examination the articles received as pledges these
gentlemen are sometimes to be duped by their customers we
remember an instance an elderly man who was in the habit
 bringing a dutch clock frequently to a pawnbroker to
raise the wind and for safety generally left it in a large
canvass bag till he became so regular a customer that his
clock and bag were often left without inspection and as it
was seldom deposited for long together it was placed in
some handy nook the shop in order to lie ready for
redemption this system having been carried on for sometime
no suspicion was entertained the old man upon one
occasion however the pawnbroker's olfactory nerves were
saluted with a smell a most unsavoury nature for which
he could by no means account day after day passed and no
discovery was made till at length he determined to overhaul
every article in his shop and if possible discover the
source a nuisance which appeared rather to increase than
abate in doing which to his utter astonishment he found
the old man's dutch clock transformed into a sheep's head
enclosed in a small box similar in shape and size to that 
the clock it will scarcely be necessary to add that being
in the heat summer the sheep's head when turned out was
in a putrid state and as green as grass the pawnbroker
declared the old gentleman's works were out repair that
he himself was out tune and eventually pledged himself
never to be so taken in again after all however it must
be acknowledged that my uncle is a very accommodating man
my uncle's the man i've oft said it before
who is ready and willing to open his door
tho some on the question may harbour a doubt
he's a mill to grind money which i call a spout
derry down
he has three golden balls which hang over his door
which clearly denote that my uncle's not poor
he has money to lend and he's always so kind
he will lend it to such as leave something behind
derry down
if to music inclin'd there's no man can so soon
set the hooks your gamut to excellent tune
all his tickets are prizes most carefully booked
and your notes must be good or you're presently hook'd
derry down
shirts shoes and flatirons hats towels and ruffs
to him are the same as rich satins or stuffs
from the pillows you lay on chairs tables or sacks
he'll take all you have to the togs on your backs
derry down
then ye who are needy repair to your friend
who is ready and willing your fortunes to mend
he's a purse full rhino and that's quite enough
tho short in his speech he can shell out short stuff
derry down
what a blessing it is in this place renown
to know that we have such an uncle in town
in all cases degrees in all places and stations
tis a good thing to know we've such friendly relations
derry down
surely said tallyhoho no person could possibly be inveigled by her
charms
 they are not very blooming just now d some agreeable and intelligent company in his house
this proposition being agreed to and directions given accordingly by
merrywell to prepare dinner our party gave loose to opinions life
observations on men and mariners exactly as they presented themselves
to the imagination each speaker and merrywell evidently proved
himself a close observer character
places like this said he are generally inhabited by the profligate
 fashion the ingenious artist or the plodding mechanic the first
is one who cares not who suffers so he obtains a discharge from his
incumbrances having figured away for some time in the labyrinths 
folly and extravagance till finding the needful run taper he yields
to john doe and richard roe as a matter course passes through his
degrees in the study the laws by retiring to the fleet or king's
bench and returns to the world with a clean face and an increased
stock information to continue his career the second are men who
have heads to contrive and hands to execute improvements in scientific
pursuits probably exhausting their time their health and their
property in the completion their projects but who are impeded in
their progress and compelled to finish their intentions in durance
vile by the rapacity their creditors and the last are persons
subjected to all the casualties trade and the arts the former and
unable to meet the peremptory demands those they are indebted
to but they seldom inhabit these places long unless they can pay
well for their accommodations money is therefore as useful in a
lockuphouse or a prison as in any other situation life
money with the generality people is every thing it is the
universal talisman there is magic in its very name it ameliorates all
the miserable circumstances life and the sound it may almost be
termed life itself it is the balm the comfort and the restorative
it must indeed be truly mortifying to the opulent to observe that the
attachment their dependents and even the apparent esteem their
friends arises from the respect paid to riches the vulgar herd bow
with reverence and respect before the wealthy but it is in fact
the money and not the individual which they worship doubtless a
philosophic tallowchandler would hasten from the contemplation the
starry heavens to vend a farthing rush light and it therefore cannot
be wondered at that the sheriffsofficer who serves you with a writ
because you have not money enough to discharge the just demands against
you should determine at least to get as much as he can out you and
when he finds your resources exhausted that he should remove you to the
common receptacle debtors which however cannot be done to your own
satisfaction without some money for if you wish a particular place 
residence or the most trifling accommodation there are fees to pay
even on entering a prison
in that case then said tallyhoho a man is actually obliged to pay forgoing
to a prison
precisely so unless he is willing to mingle with the very lowest order
 society but come we will walk into the coffeeroom and take a view
 the inmates
upon entering this which was a small dark room they heard a great
number voices and in one corner found several the prisoners
surrounding a bagatelleboard and playing for porter ale c in
another corner was a young man in close conversation with an
attorney and a little further distant was a hardfeatured man taking
instructions from the turnkey how to act here was a poor player who
declared he would take the benefit the act and afterwards take a
benefit at the theatre to reestablish himself there a poet racking
his imagination and roving amidst the flowers fancy giving a few
touches by way finish to an ode to liberty with the produce
 which he indulged himself in a hope obtaining the subject his
muse the conversation was a mingled nature the vociferations the
bagatelleplayers the whispers the attorney and his client and the
declarations the prisoner to the turnkey that he would be d d
if he did not serve em out and floor the whole boiling them
were now and then interrupted by the notes a violin playing the most
lively airs in an animated and tasteful style the performer however was
not visible but appeared to be so near that merrywell who was a great
lover music beckoned his friends to follow him they now entered a
small yard at the back the house the usual promenade those who
resided in it and found the musician seated on one the benches
which were continued nearly round the yard and which itself formed
a panorama rural scenery here was the bubbling cascade and the lofty
fountain there the shady grove majestic poplars and the meandering
stream glittering in the resplendent lustre a rising sun the waving
foliage however and the bubbling fountain were not to be seen or heard
as these beauties were only to be contemplated in the labours the
painter but to make up for the absence these with the harmony
 the birds and the rippling the stream the musician was
endeavouring like an arcadian shepherd with his pipe to make the
woods resound with the notes his fiddle surrounded by some his
fellowprisoners who did not fail to applaud his skill and reward his
kindness by supplying him with rosin as they termed it which was by
handing him the heavywet as often as they found his elbow at rest in
one place was to be seen a butcher who upon his capture was visited by
his wife with a child in her arms upon whom the melody seemed to have
no effect she was an interesting and delicatelooking woman whose
agitation spirits upon so melancholy an occasion were evidenced by
streaming tears from a pair lovely dark eyes and the butcher as
evidently forgetful his usual calling was sympathising with and
endeavouring to soothe her into composure and fondling the child in
another a person who had the appearance an halfpay officer with
hessian boots blue pantaloons and a black silk handkerchief sat with
his arms folded almost without taking notice what was passing around
him though a rough sailor with a pipe in his mouth occasionally 
enlivened the scene by accompanying the notes the musician with a
characteristic dance which he termed a hornspike
it was a fine scene real life and after taking a few turns in the
gardens the lockup or sponginghouse they returned to merrywell's
apartments which they had scarcely entered when the tandem drew up to
the door
more company said merry well
and perhaps the more the merrier replied tom
that is as it may prove was the reply for the company this
house ace as various at times as can be met with in any other situation
however this appears to wear the form one our fashionable
highlife gentlemen but appearances are often deceitful we shall
perhaps hear more him presently he may turn out to be one the
prodigals who calculate the duration life at about ten years that
is to have a short life and a merry one
that seems to me to be rather a short career too exclaimed bob
nay nay that is a long calculation for it frequently cannot be made
to last half the number in the first place the pupil learns every kind
 extravagance which he practises en maitre the two next years these
make an his fortune he lives two more on credit established
while his property lasted the next two years he has a letter 
licence and contrives to live by ways and means for he has grown
comparatively knowing then he marries and the wife has the honour
 discharging his debts her fortune proving just sufficient for the
purpose then he manages to live a couple years more on credit and
retires to one his majesty's prisons
by this time mr safebind made his appearance and with great politeness
inquired if the gentlemen were accommodated in the way they wished
upon being assured this and requested to take a seat after some
introductory conversation he gave them the following account himself
and his business
we have brought nine gemmen into the house this morning and though i
say it no german goes out that would have any objection to come into it
again
tallyhoho shrugged up his shoulders in a way that seemed to imply a doubt
 for continued he a german that is a german shall always find
genteel treatment here i always acts upon honour and secrecy and if as
how a german can't bring his affairs into a comfortable shape here why
then he is convey'd away without exposure that is if he understands
things
with assurances this kind the veracity which no one present could
doubt they were entertained for some time by their loquacious host
who having the gift the gab would probably have continued long
in the same strain important information when dinner was placed on
the table and they fell to with good appetites seeming almost to have
made use the customary grace among theatricals
the table cleared the frequent glass goes round and joke and song and
merriment abound
your house said dashall might well be termed the temple the
arts since their real votaries are so frequently its inhabitants
very true sir said safebind and as the poet observes it is as
often graced by the presence the devotees to the sciences in point
 company he says we may almost call it multum in pavo or the camera
obscura life there are at this time within these walls a learned
alchymist two students in anatomy and a physician a poet a player
and a musician the player is an adept at mimicry the musician a good
player and the poet no bad stick at a rhyme all anxious to turn their
talents to good account and when mingled together productive
 harmony though the situation they are in at present is rather
discordant to their feelings but then you know tis said that discord
is the soul harmony and they knocked up a duet among themselves
yesterday which i thought highly amusing
i am fond music said merry well do you think they would take a
glass wine with us
 gift the gab fluency speech
 it is a very common thing among the minor theatricals
when detained at rehearsals c to adjourn to some
convenient room in the neighbourhood for refreshment and
equally common for them to commence operations in a truly
dramatic way by exclaiming to each other in the language
 shakespeare
come on macbeth come on macduff
and d d be he who first cries hold enough
 most readily no doubt was the reply i will introduce them
in a minute thus saying he left the room and in a very few minutes
returned with the three votaries apollo who soon joined in the
conversation upon general subjects the player now discovered his
loquacity the poet his sagacity and the musician his pertinacity
for he thought no tones so good as those produced by himself nor no
notes we beg pardon none but bank notes equal to his own
it will be sufficient for our present purpose to add that the
bottle circulated quickly and what with the songs the poet the
recitations the player and the notes the fiddler time which
perfects all intellectual ability and also destroys the most stupendous
monuments art brought the sons apollo under the table and
admonished dashall and his cousin to depart which they accordingly
did after a promise to see their friend merry well in his intended new
quarters
chapter xxiv
all nations boast some men nobler mind
their scholars heroes benefactors kind
and britain has her share among the rest
 men the wisest boldest and the best
yet we knaves and fools have ample share
and eccentricities beyond compare
full many a life is spent and many a purse
in mighty nothings or in something worse
the next scene which tom was anxious to introduce to his cousin's
notice was that a political dinner but while they were preparing for
departure a letter arrived which completely satisfied the mind the
hon tom dashall as to the motives and views their friend sparkle
and ran as follows
dear dashall
having rivetted the chains matrimony on the religious anvil 
gretna green i am now one the happiest fellows in existence
my election is crowned with success and i venture to presume all
afterpetitions will be rejected as frivolous and vexatious the once
lovely miss mortimer is now the ever to be loved mrs sparkle i shall
not now detain your attention by an account our proceedings or
adventures on the road we shall have many more convenient opportunities
 indulging in such details when we meet replete as i can assure you
they are with interest
i have written instructions to my agent in town for the immediate
disposal my paternal estate in wiltshire and mean hereafter to take
up my abode on one i have recently purchased in the neighbourhood 
belville hall where i anticipate many pleasurable opportunities
 seeing you and our friend tallyhoho surrounding my hospitable and
hereafter family board we shall be there within a month as we mean
to reach our place destination by easy stages and look about us
please remember me to all old friends in town and believe as ever
your's truly
charles sparkle
carlisle
 the receipt this letter and its contents were immediately
communicated to young mortimer who had already received some
intelligence a similar nature which had the effect allaying
apprehension and dismissing fear for his sister's safety the mysterious
circumstances were at once explained and harmony was restored to the
previously agitated family
i am truly glad this information said tom and as we are at
present likely to be politically engaged we cannot do less than take a
bumper or two after dinner to the health and happiness the candidate
who so emphatically observes he has gained his election and in the
true language every patriot declares he is the happiest man alive
notwithstanding the rivets by which he is bound
you are inclined to be severe said tallyhoho
by no means replied dashall the language the letter certainly
seems a little in consonance with my observation but i am sincere in my
good wishes towards the writer and his amiable wife come we must now
take a view other scenes hear long speeches drink repeated bumpers
and shout with lungs leather till the air resounds with peals 
approbation
we shall there see and hear the great men the nation or at least
who are such in their own estimation
great in the name a patriot father bore
behold a youth promise boldly soar
outstrip his fellows clambering height extreme
and reach to eminence almost supreme
with wellworn mask and virtue's fair pretence
and all the art smoothtongued eloquence
he talks wise reform rights most dear
till half the nation thinks the man sincere
hey day said tallyhoho who do you apply this to
those who find the cap fit may wear it was the reply 
i leave it wholly to the discriminating few who can discover what
belongs to themselves without further comment
 by this time they had arrived at the crown and anchor tavern in
the strand where they found a great number persons assembled sir
f b having been announced as president in a few minutes he was
ushered into the room with all due pomp and ceremony preceded by
the stewards for the occasion and accompanied by a numerous body 
friends consisting mr h major c and others though
not equally prominent equally zealous during dinner time all went on
smoothly except in some instances where the voracity some 
the visitors almost occasioned a chopping off the fingers their
neighbours but the cloth once removed and non nobis domine sung by
professional gentlemen had the effect calling the attention the
company to harmony the band in the orchestra played o give me death
or liberty erin go brach britons strike home and whilst happy
in my native land the singers introduced scots wha hae wi wallace
bled peruvians wake to glory and the tyrolese hymn but the
spirit oratory enlivened by the fire the bottle exhibited its
illuminating sparks in a blaze lustre which eclipsed even the gaslights
by which they were surrounded so much so that the waiters
themselves became confused and remained stationary or when they
moved were so dazzled by the patriotic effusions the various
speakers that they fell over each other spilt the wine in the pockets
 the company and by making afterwards a hasty retreat left them to
fight or argue between each other for supposed liberties taken even by
their immediate friends
illustration pages political dinner
unbridled feelings patriotic ardour appeared to pervade every one
present and what with the splendid oratory the speakers and the
deafening vociferations the hearers at the conclusion what
was generally considered a good point a sufficient indication the
feelings by which they were all animated was evinced
at the lower the table sat a facetious clerical gentleman who
unmindful his ministerial duties was loud in his condemnation 
ministers and as loud in his approbation those who gave them what
he repeatedly called a good hit but here a subject great laughter
occurred for mr marrowfat the peamerchant coventgarden and mr
borrowed the feathermonger drury lane in their zeal for the good
cause arising at the same moment big with ardour and sentiment to
address the chair on a subject the most momentous importance
in their consideration and desirous to signalize themselves
individually so completely defeated their objects by over anxiety to
gain precedence that they rolled over each other on the floor to the
inexpressible amusement the company and the total obliteration 
their intended observations so much so that the harangue meant to
enlighten their friends ended in a fine colloquy abuse upon each
other
the bottles the glasses and the other paraphernalia the table
suffered considerable diminution in the descent these modern cicero
and a variety speakers arising upon their downfall created so much
confusion that our heroes fearing it would be some time before harmony
could be restored took up their hats and walked
now said dashall as they left the house you have had a full
view the pleasantries a political dinner and having seen the
characters by which such an entertainment is generally attended any
further account them is almost rendered useless
at least replied tallyhoho i have been gratified by the view some
 the leading men who contribute to fill up the columns your london
newspapers
egad said his cousin now i think it there is a tine opportunity
 amusing ourselves for the remainder the evening by a peep at
another certain house in westminster whether it may be assimilated in
point character or contents to what we have just witnessed i shall
leave you after taking a review to determine
what do you mean inquired tallyhoho
charley's my boy that's the place for sport something in the old
style the professors there are all the ancient school and we shall
just be in time for the first lecture it is a school science and
though established upon the ancient construction is highly suitable to
the taste the moderns
zounds replied bob our heads are hardly in cue for philosophy after
so much wine and noise we had better defer it to another opportunity
nay nay now's the very time for it it will revive the recollection
 some your former sports
for midst our luxuries be it understood
some traits remain rugged hardihood
 charley is a good caterer for the public appetite and to
diversify the amusements a life in london we will have a little
chaff among the bearwaiters
tallyho stared for a moment then burst into laughter at the curious
introduction his cousin had given to this subject i have long
perceived your talent for embellishment but certainly was not prepared
for the conclusion but you ought rather to have denominated them
students in natural history
and what is that but a branch philosophy inquired dashall
however we are discussing points opinion rather than hastening to
the scene action to become judges facts allons
upon saying this they moved forward with increased celerity towards
tothillfields and soon reached their proposed place destination
on entering tallyhoho was reminded by his cousin to button up his
toggery keep his ogles in action and be awake for said he you
will here have to mingle with some the queer gills and rum copies 
all ranks
this advice being taken they soon found themselves in this temple 
torment where bob surveyed a mostly group assembled and at that moment
engaged in the sports the evening the generality the company bore
the appearance butchers dogfanciers and ruffians intermingled
here and there with a few sprigs fashion a few corinthian shells
costermongers coalheavers watermen soldiers and liveryservants
illustration pages the country squire
the bear was just then pinn'd by a dog belonging to a real lover the
game who with his shirtsleeves tuck'd up declared he was a d d
good one and nothing but a good one so help him g d this dog at
the hazard his life had seized poor bruin by the under lip who
sent forth a tremendous howl indicative his sufferings and was
endeavouring to give him a fraternal hug many other dogs were barking
aloud with anxiety to take an active share in the amusement while the
bear who was chained by the neck to a staple in the wall and compelled
to keep an almost erect posture shook his antagonist with all the fury
 madness produced by excessive torture in the mean time bets were
made and watches pull'd forth to decide how long the bowwow would
bother the ragged russian the dogbreeders were chaffing each other
upon the value their canine property each holding his 
brotherpuppy between his legs till a fair opportunity for a letloose
offered and many wagers were won and lost in a short space time bob
remained a silent spectator while his cousin who was better up to the
gossip mixt with the hardfeatured sportsmen inquired the names 
their dogs what prices were fix'd upon when they had fought last and
other questions equally important to amateurs
bruin got rid his customers in succession as they came up to him
and when they had once made a seizure it was generally by a hug which
almost deprived them life at least it took from them the power 
continuing their hold but his release from one was only the signal for
attack from another
while this exhibition continued tom could not help calling his cousin's
attention to an almost baldheaded man who occupied a front seat and
sat with his dog which was something the bull breed between his
legs while the paws the animal rested on the top rail and which
forcibly brought to his recollection the wellknown anecdote garrick
and the butcher's dog with his master's wig on while the greasy
carcassdealer was wiping the perspiration from his uncovered
pericranium
bob who had seen a badgerbait and occasionally at fairs in the
country a dancing bear had never before seen a bearbait stood up most
 the time observing those around him and paying attention to their
proceedings while entertaining sentiments somewhat similar to the
following lines
what boisterous shouts what blasphemies obscene
what eager movements urge each threatening mien
present the spectacle human kind
devoid feeling destitute mind
with ev'ry dreadful passion rous'd to flame
all sense justice lost and sense shame
when charley the proprietor thought his bear was sufficiently exercised
for the night he was led to his den lacerated and almost lamed to
recover his wounds with an intention that he should fight his
battles o'er again meanwhile tom and bob walk'd homeward
the next day having been appointed for the coronation our most
gracious sovereign our friends were off at an early hour in the
morning to secure their seats in westminster hall and on their
way they met the carriage our disappointed and now much lamented
queen her endeavours to obtain admission to the abbey having proved
fruitless
oh that the monarch had as firmly stood
in all his acts to serve the public good
as in that moment heartfelt joy
that firmness acted only to destroy
a nation's hope to every heart allied
who lived in sorrow and lamented died
it was a painful circumstance to dashall who was seldom severe in his
judgments or harsh in his censures he regretted its occurrence and it
operated in some degree to rob a splendid ceremony its magnificence
and to sever from royalty half its dignity
the preparations however were arranged upon a scale grandeur suited
to the occasion the exterior westminster hall and abbey presented
a most interesting appearance commodious seats were erected for the
accommodation spectators to view the procession in its moving order
and were thronged with thousands anxious subjects to greet their
sovereign with demonstrations loyalty and love
it was certainly a proud day national festivity the firing guns
and the ringing bells announced the progress the coronation in
its various stages to completion and in the evening hyde park was
brilliantly and tastefully illuminated and an extensive range 
excellent fireworks were discharged under the direction sir william
congreve we must however confine ourselves to that which came under the
view the hon tom dashall and his cousin who being seated in
the hall had a fine opportunity witnessing the banquet and the
challenge the champion
a flooring wood had been laid down in the hall at an elevation 
fourteen inches above the flags three tiers galleries were erected
on each side covered with a rich and profuse scarlet drapery falling
from a cornice formed a double row goldtwisted rope and
ornamented with a succession magnificent gold pelmets and rosettes
the front the door which entered from the passage without was
covered with a curtain scarlet trimmed with deep gold fringe and
looped up on each side with silken ropes the floor and to the
extremity the first three steps the throne was covered with a
splendid persianpattern wilton carpet and the remainder the steps
with scarlet baize
the canopy the throne which was square was surrounded by a
beautiful carved and gilt cornice prepared by mr evans beneath the
cornice hung a succession crimsonvelvet helmet drapery each helmet
having embroidered upon it a rose a thistle a crown or a harp
surmounting the cornice in front was a gilt crown upon a velvet cushion
over the letters ceo supported on each side by an antique gilt
ornament the entire back the throne as well as the interior the
canopy were covered with crimson genoa velvet which was relieved by a
treble row broad and narrow gold lace which surrounded the whole
in the centre the back were the royal arms the lion and the unicorn
rampant embroidered in the most costly style under this stood the
chair state and near the throne were six splendid chairs placed for
the other members the royal family these decorations and the hall
being splendidly illuminated presented to the eye a spectacle 
the most imposing nature heightened by the brilliant assemblage 
elegantly dressed personages the ladies universally wore ostrich
feathers and the gentlemen were attired in the most sumptuous dresses
illustration pages grand coronation dinner
about four o'clock his majesty having gone through the other fatiguing
ceremonies the day entered the hall with the crown upon his head
and was greeted with shouts long live the king from all quarters
shortly after which the banquet was served by the necessary officers
but that part the ceremony which most attracted the attention 
tallyhoho was the challenge the champion whose entrance was announced
by the sound the trumpets thrice and who having proceeded on a
beautiful horse in a full suit armour under the porch a triumphal
arch attended by the duke wellington on his right and the deputy
earl marshal on his left to the place assigned him the challenge was
read aloud by the herald he then threw down his gauntlet which having
lain a short time was returned to him this ceremony was repeated three
times when he drank to his majesty and received the gold cup and cover
as his fee
 the whole this magnificent national pageant was conducted
throughout with the most scrupulous attention to the customary etiquette
 such occasions and tallyhoho who had never witnessed any thing the
kind before and consequently could have no conception its splendour
was at various parts the ceremony enraptured he fancied himself
in fairyland and that every thing he saw and heard was the effect 
enchantment our friends returned home highly gratified with their day's
amusement
chapter xxv
behold the ring how strange the group appears
 dirty blackguards commoners and peers
jews who regard not moses nor his laws
all ranks christians eager in the cause
what eager bets what oaths at every breath
who first shall shrink or first be beat to death
thick fall the blows and oft the boxers fall
while deaf'ning shouts for fresh exertions call
till bruised and blinded batter'd sore and maim'd
one gives up vanquish'd and the other lam'd
say men wealth say what applause is due
for scenes like these when patronised by you
these are your scholars who in humbler way
but with less malice at destruction play
you like game cocks strike death with polish'd steel
they dunghighbred use only nature's heel
they fight for something you for nothing fight
they box for love but you destroy in spite
 the following tuesday having been appointed by the knowing ones
for a pugilistic encounter between jack randall commonly called the
nonpareil and martin as well known by the appellation the master 
the rolls from his profession being that a baker an excellent day's
sport was anticipated and the lads the fancy were all upon the quivive

our friends had consequently arranged on the previous night to
breakfast at an early hour and take a gentle ride along the road with
a determination to see as much as possible the attractive amusements
 a millingmatch and to take a view as they went along the company
they were afterwards to mingle with
we shall now said dashall as they sat down to breakfast have a
peep at the lads the ring and see a little the real science 
boxing
we have been boxing the compass through the difficult straits a
london life for some time replied bob and i begin to think that
with all its variety its gaiety and
 its pride the most legitimate joys life may fairly be said to
exist in the country
i confess said dashall that most the pleasures life are
comparative and arise from contrast thus the bustle london
heightens the serenity the country while again the monotony the
country gives additional zest to the evervarying scenes london but
why this observation at a moment when we are in pursuit fresh game
nay said tallyhoho i know not why but i spoke as i thought feeling
as i do a desire to have a pop at the partridges as the season is now
fast approaching and having serious thoughts shifting my quarters
we will talk that hereafter was the reply you have an excellent
day's sport in view let us not throw a cloud upon the prospect before
us you seem rather in the doldrums the amusements this day will
perhaps inspire more lively ideas and then we shall be present at the
masquerade which will doubtless be well attended all the fashion 
the metropolis will be present and there you will find a new world
such as surpasses the powers imagination a sort elysium
unexplored before full mirth frolic whim wit and variety to
charm every sense in nature but come we must not delay participating
in immediate gratifications by the anticipations those intended for
the future besides i have engaged to give the champion a cast to the
scene action in my barouche
by this time piccadilly was all in motion coaches carts gigs
til buries whiskies buggies dogcarts sociables tenets curricles
and sulkies were passing in rapid succession intermingled with
taxcarts and waggons decorated with laurel conveying company the
most varied description in a few minutes the barouche being at
the door crack went the whip and off they bowled bob's eyes were
attracted on all sides here was to be seen the dashing corinthian
tickling up his tits and his bangup setout blood and bone giving
the goby to a heavy drag laden with eight brawny bullfaced blades
smoking their way down behind a skeleton a horse to whom in all
probability a good feed corn would have been a luxury pattering
among themselves occasionally chaffing the more elevated drivers by
whom they were surrounded and pushing forward their nags with all the
ardour a british merchant intent upon disposing a valuable
cargo foreign goods on change there was a waggon full all
sorts upon the lark succeeded by a donkeycart with four insides but
neddy not liking his burthen stopt short on the way a dandy whose
horse's head coming plump up to the back the crazy vehicle at the
moment its stoppage threw the rider into the arms a dustman who
hugging his customer with the determined grasp a bear swore d n
his eyes he had saved his life and he expected he would stand something
handsome for the gemmen all round for if he had not pitched into their
cart he would certainly have broke his neck which being complied with
though reluctantly he regained his saddle and proceeded a little more
cautiously along the remainder the road while groups pedestrians
 all ranks and appearances lined each side
at hydepark corner tom having appointed to take up the prime
hammerman drew up and was instantly greeted by a welcome from the
expected party who being as quickly seated they proceeded on their
journey
this match appears to occupy general attention said tom
i should think so was the reply why it will be a prime thing
as ever was seen betting is all alive the daffy club in tiptop
spirits lots money sported on both sides somebody must make a
mull but randall's the man he is the favourite the day all the
world to a pennyroll
the simile the penny roll being quite in point with the known title
 one the combatants caused a smile on dashall's countenance which
was caught by the eye tallyhoho and created some mirth as it was
a proof what has frequently been witnessed that the lovers the
fancy are as apt in their imaginations at times as they are ready for
the accommodating one two or the friendly flush hit which floors their
opponents
the morning was fine and the numerous persons who appeared travelling
on the road called forth many inquiries from bob
now said he i think i recollect that the admirable author the
sentimental journey used to read as he went along is it possible to
read as we journey forward doubtless replied tom it is and will
produce
 mull defeat loss or disappointment
 a fund amusing speculation as we jog on latter founded his
judgment men upon the formation their features gall and spurzheim
by the lumps bumps and cavities their pericranium but i doubt not
we shall be right in our views the society we are likely to meet
without the help either do you see that group
bob nodded assent
these continued tom are profitable characters or rather men 
profit who kindly considering the constitution their friends
provide themselves with refreshments various kinds to supply the
hungry visitors round the ring oranges nuts apples gingerbread
biscuits and peppermint drops
not forgetting blue ruin and french lace said the man fist
but you have only half done it don't you see the cashcove 
behind with his stick across his shoulder padding the hoof in
breathless speed he has shelled out the lour for the occasion and
is travelling down to keep a wakeful winker on his retailers and
to take care that however they may chuse to lush away the profit they
shall at least take care the principal the little dandy just before
him also acts as whipperin between them they mark out the ground
watch the progress and pocket the proceeds they lend the money for the
others to traffic
i confess said tom i was not exactly up to this
aye aye but i know the bluntmonger and am up to his ways and
means was the reply hallo my eyes here he comes continued he
rising from his seat and bowing obsequiously to a gentleman who passed
them in a tandem all right i am glad it always good sport when
he is present no want sauce or seasoning he always comes it
strong 
i perceive replied tom you allude to the noble marquis w 
 french lace a flash or cant term for brandy
 cashcove a monied man
 padding the hoof travelling on shanks's mare or taking
a turn by the marrowbone stage ie walking
 shelled out the lour supplied the cash
 wakeful winker a sharp eye
 mark out the ground is to place his retailers in various
parts the ring for the accommodation the company anywhere
he may expect to find them himself
 bluntmonger moneydealer or moneylender
 comes it strong no flincher a real good one
 travelling gently along the road they were presently impeded by
a crowd persons who surrounded a long cart or waggon which had just
been overturned and had shot out a motley group personages who
were being lifted on their legs growling and howling at this unforeseen
disaster a hardfeatured sailor whose leg had been broken by the fall
brandished a splinter the fractured limb and swore that although
his timbers were shivered and he had lost a leg in the service he
would not be the last in the ring but he'd be d d if he mount the
rubbishcart any more it is needless to observe his leg was a wooden
one
upon examining the inscription on the cart it was found to contain the
following words household furniture building materials and lumber
carefully removed as it was ascertained that no real injury had
been sustained our party speedily passed the overturned vehicle and
proceeded
the next object attraction was a small cart drawn by one poor animal
sweating and snorting under the weight six swells led by an old man
who seemed almost as incapable as his horse seemed unwilling to perform
the journey a label on the outside the cart intimated that its
contents was soap which created some laughter between tom and bob the
man in the front whose jewlooking appearance attracted attention was
endeavouring to increase the speed the conveyance by belabouring the
boney rump the pray with his hat while some their pedestrian
palls were following close in the rear and taking occasionally
a drap the cratur which was handed out behind and returned after
refreshment
these said tom to his cousin are also men profit but
not exactly in the way those we passed secondrate swells and
brokendown gamesters determined as the saying is to have a shy
even if they lose their sticks and more properly may be termed men 
plunder desperate in their pursuits they turn out with intent to
make the best the day and will not fail to nibble all they can come
easily at
they are not worth the blood from a broken nose said the pugilist
with a feeling for the honour his profession which did him
credit they are all prigs their company
 pray a cant term for a horse
 palls partners accomplices colleagues
 spoils all genteel society and frequently brings disgrace
upon others with whom they are unworthy to associate or even to be
seen there's no getting rid such gentry is it not d d hard a
man can't have a pleasant bit a turnup without having his friends
filched but here comes the gay fellows here they come upon the trot
all eager and anxious to mark the first blow start the odds and curry
the coal these are the lads life true lovers the sport up to
the manoeuvre clear and quicksighted nothing but good ones aye aye
and here comes bill gibbons furnished with the fashionables
what do you call the fashionables inquired bob
why the binders
here he was as much at a loss as ever which the other perceiving he
continued the binders are the stakes and ropes to fence in the ring
bill gibbons who was well known on the road and was speeding down
pretty sharp was followed by crowds vehicles all descriptions as
many to whom the place meeting was but conjectured upon seeing
him felt assured being in the right track here were to be seen the
swells in their tandems the nib sprigs in their gigs buggies and
dogcarts and the tidy ones on their trotters all alive and leaping
mirth and merriment appeared spread over every countenance though
expectation and anxiety were intermingled here and there in the features
 the real lads the fancy many whom upon this very interesting
occasion had bets to a considerable amount depending upon the result 
the day the bangup blades were pushing their prads along in gay style
accompanied by two friends that is to say a biped and a quadruped the
queer fancy lads who had hired hacks from the liverystable keepers
were kicking up a dust and here and there rolling from their prancers
in their native soil while the neck or nothing boys with no prospect
but a whereas before their eyes were as heedless their personal
safety as they were their creditor's property jaded hacks and crazy
vehicles were to be seen on all sides here lay a bankruptcart with
the panels knocked and its driver with an eye knock'd out the horse
lamed and the concern completely knock'd up just before the period
when the hammer the auctioneer was to be called in and his effects
knock'd down there was another
 curry the coal make sure the money
 the same description with a harumscarum devil 
a halfbred making his way at all risks at a full gallop as
unmanageable in his career as his driver had been in his speculations
dust flying women sprawling men bawling dogs barking and the
multitude continually increasing scouts scamps lords loungers and
lacqueys costermongers from to the hill fields and the bloods from
bermondsey completely lined the road as far as the eye could reach
both before and behind it was a day the utmost importance to the
pugilistic school as the contest had excited a most unparalleled degree
 interest
it would be scarcely possible to give a full and accurate description
 the appearances as they went along imagination would labour in vain
and words are altogether incapable conveying a picture the road to
this memorable fight the various instances in which they could discover
that things were not all right were admirably contrasted by others
where care and good coachmanship with a perfect management the
bloods proved the reverse while the single horsemen whose hearts were
really engaged in the sport were picking their way with celerity and
posting to the point attraction the publichouses were thronged
to excess and the turnpikekeepers made a market the mirthmoving
throng
illustration pages road to a fight
our party arrived in the neighbourhood copthorne about halfpast
twelve where all was bustle and confusion the commissary in chief mr
jackson being out town some the subalterns who had taken the
command pro tempore had for divers weighty reasonsprincipally
founded on a view to the profits certain the surrey trusts and to
accommodate the sporting circles at brighton fixed the combat to take
place in a meadow belonging to a farmer named jarvis near this place
on this spot accordingly the ring was formed and an immense mass 
all descriptions vehicles was admitted not much it may naturally
be supposed to the prejudice the owner the premises whose
agents were praiseworthily active in levying proper contributions some
gentlemen however in the neighbourhood observing that the strictest
delicacy was not maintained towards the sacredness their fences
insisted that the place was too confined and intimated that a move must
be made or they should make application to the magistrates and at
the same time suggested crawley downs the site so many former
skirmishes as the most convenient spot for their accommodation
in this state things a move immediately took place and a fresh
ring was established on the spot alluded to but in effecting this new
lodgment much mortification was experienced not alone by those who
after a dreadful drag up one the worst byroads in england had
obtained a comfortable situation but by those who speculating on the
formation the ring had expended considerable sums in the hire 
waggons for their purpose from the surrounding farmers the waggons
it was found impossible to move in due time and thus the new area was
composed such vehicles as were first to reach the appointed ground
the general confusion now was inconceivable for notwithstanding the
departure connoisseurs from jarvis's farm martin still maintained
his post alleging that he was on the ground originally fixed and
that he should expect randall to meet him there in which demand he was
supported by his backers this tended to increase the embarrassment 
the amateurs however about one randall arrived at crawley downs ina
postchaise and took up his quarters at a cottage near the ground
waiting for his man and at two general barton who had just mounted
his charger intending to consult the headquarters the magistrates
to ascertain their intention in case proceeding to action at jarvis's
farm was suddenly arrested in his progress by an express from the
maronites announcing that their champion had yielded his claim to the
choice ground and was so anxious for the mill that he would meet
randall even in a sawpit bill gibbons arriving soon after the ring
with the assistance many hands was quickly formed by which time
tom and bob had secured themselves excellent situations to view the
combat
about twenty minutes before three randall entered the outer ring
attended by general barton and mr griffiths he was attired in a
whitehall upper benjamin and threw his hat into the ring amidst loud
applause in a few minutes after martin approached from an opposite
direction accompanied by mr sant and mr elliott he was also warmly
greeted
the men now passed the ropes and were assisted by their immediate
friends in peeling for action martin was attended by spring and
thereon randall by harry holt and haddington jones
the men stript well and both appeared to be in excellent health good
spirits and high condition but the symmetry randall's bust excited
general admiration and the muscular strength his arms neck and
shoulders bore testimony to his herculean qualities the whole force 
his body in fact seem'd to be concentrated above his waistband martin
stood considerably above him his arms were much longer but they wanted
that bold and imposing weight which characterized those randall they
walked up to the scratch and shook hands in perfect good fellowship
every man now took his station and the heroes threw themselves into
their guard
it was rumoured that martin intended to lose no time in manoeuvring but
to go to work instanter this however he found was not so easily to
be effected as suggested for randall had no favour to grant and was
therefore perfectly on his guard he was all wary caution and had
clearly no intention throwing away a chance but was evidently
waiting for martin to commence martin once or twice made play but
randall was not skittish inclined all was war hawk randall made a
lefthanded hit to draw his adversary but found it would not do
martin then hit right and left but was stopped randall was feeling for
martin's wind but hit above his mark though not without leaving one 
a red colour which told a flattering tale randall returned with his
left and the men got to a smart rally when randall got a konker which
tapped the claret an almost instantaneous close followed in which
randall grasping martin round the neck with his right arm and bringing
his head to a convenient posture served out punishment with his left
this was indeed a terrific position randall was always famous for the
dreadful force his short lefthanded hits and on this occasion they
lost none their former character martin's nob was completely in a
vice and while in that hopeless condition randall fibbed away with the
solid weight the hammer a tuckmill his aim was principally at
the neck where every blow told with horrible violence eight or ten
times did he repeat the dose and then with a violent swing threw
martin to the ground falling on him as he went with all his weight
the ring resounded with applause and jack coolly took his seaton
the knee his second martin's friends began to look blue but
still expected the fight being young there was yet much to be done
all eyes were now turned to martin who being lifted on spring's knee
in a second discovered that he was done his head fell back lifeless
and all the efforts spring to keep it straight were in vain water
was thrown on him in abundance but without effect he was in fact
completely senseless and the halfminute having transpired the
nonpareil was hailed the victor
randall appeared almost without a scratch while poor martin lay like a
lump unleavened dough he was removed and bled but it was some time
before he was conscious his defeat
nothing could exceed the astonishment which so sudden and complete a
finish to the business produced the round lasted but seven minutes and
a half which four minutes and a half had elapsed before a blow was
attempted thus ended one the most extraordinary battles between two
known game men on the pugilistic records very heavy bets had been made
upon it in all parts the kingdom one gentleman is said to have had
five thousand pounds and another one thousand eight hundred guineas
the gains the conqueror were supposed to be about a thousand pounds
the amusements the day were concluded by a second fight between
parish and lashbroke which proved a manly and determined contest for
upwards an hour and in which the combatants evinced considerable
skill and bravery and was finally decided in favour parish all
amusement which might have been derived from this spectacle however
was completely destroyed by the daring outrages an immense gang 
pickpockets who broke in the ring and closed completely up to the
ropes carrying with them every person decent appearance and openly
robbing them their watches pocketbooks and purses and the lateness
 the hour it being five o'clock and almost dark favoured the
depredators
in the midst this struggle tom dashall had nearly lost his fancy
topper and tallyhoho was secretly eased his clicker from the
scene tumult and confusion they were glad to escape and being again
safely seated in the
 topper a flash term given to a hat
 flicker a flash term given to a watch
 barouche they made the best their way home in doing which
they found the roads almost as much clogg'd as they were in the morning
the randallites were meritorious and flushed with good fortune lined
the publichouses on the road to wet their whistles singing and
shouting his name in strains to them equally inspiring as
see the conquering hero comes
sound your trumpets beat your drums
while the maronites rolled along the road in sullen silence and by
the time they reached town an account the battle was hawking about
the streets and songs singing to the praise the successful combatant
in all the melodious cadences a last dying speech and confession
such is the promptitude london printers poets and newsvenders
well said dashall as they reentered the house the events this
day have completely disappointed some the knowing ones
that may be replied bob but they have been too knowing for me
notwithstanding your previous instructions however i don't regret
seeing the humours a prize ring and the next time you catch me
there i must take a lesson from the man profit and keep a wakeful
winker on the possibles really i could not help feeling astonished at
the immense number persons assembled on such an occasion
illustration page a private turnup
zounds said tom tis the real centre attraction the thing
the tippy and the twig among the lads the fancy why it is pretty
generally known through the medium the newspapers that a certain
nobleman paid the debts one these pugilists amounting to l
that he might be released from newgate in order to fight a prize battle
and it is not long since that the marquis t ed e whilst
entertaining a large party after dinner introduced the subject with so
much effect that a purse guineas was subscribed among them for a
turn up between two the prime hammered who being introduced
actually setto in his drawingroom for the amusement his friends
nor is it less true that this sporting nobleman gloriously took up the
conqueror as the saying is and evinced his patronage and his power at
once by actually subduing his antagonist proving to certitude that if
his lordship would but practise this sublime art he could hardly
fail adding to his present title that the champion england it
is the theme constant conversation and in many cases there is more
anxiety about contests this sort than there is about the arrival a
monarch on the irish coast among the lads parties whiskey and
buttermilk thoughts are busy energies are active and money in galore
is circulated upon it
bob laughed heartily at these observations his cousin upon what he
termed the sublime art
you don't appear to enter into the spirit it continued tom but
i can assure you it is a very animating subject and has occupied the
attention all classes from the peer to the prelate the peasant
and the potboy it is said that one the lower order ranting
preachers not many miles from boltononthemoors lately addressed
his auditory in the following metaphorical language accompanied with
striking and appropriate attitudes i dare say now you'd pay to see
a boxingmatch between randall and turner or martin yet you don't like
to pay for seeing a pitchedbattle between me and the black champion
beelzebub oh my friends many a hard knock and many a crossbuttock
have i given the arch bruiser mankind aye and all for your dear
sakes pull do pull off those gay garments mammon strike the devil
a straightforward blow in the mouth darken his spiritual daylight
at him manfully give it him right and left and i'll be your
bottleholder i ask nothing but the money which you'll not forget
before you go 
the true spirit moved him said bob and a very laudable one too but
he very emphatically deprecated the votaries mammon
certainly he being called would have been unworthy his calling if
he had not
this conversation was carried on over a glass generous wine and
dwindling into indifferent subjects is not necessary to be detailed
suffice it to say that fatigued with the day's exertions they sought
repose in the arms morpheus at an early hour determined on the
pursuit fresh game with the dawn the morning
chapter xxvi
see yonder beaux so delicately gay
and yonder belles so'deck'd in thin array
ah rather see not what a decent pride
would teach a maiden modestly to hide
the dress so flimsy the exposure such
twould almost make a very wanton blush
e'en married dames forgetting what is due
to sacred ties give half clad charms to view
what calls them forth to brave the daring glance
the public ball the midnight wanton dance
there many a blooming nymph by fashion led
has felt her health her peace her honour fled
truss'd her fine form to strange fantastic shapes
to be admir'd and twirl'd about by apes
or mingling in the motley masquerade
found innocence by visor vice betrayed
an agreeable lounge through the parks in the morning afforded them an
opportunity recalling in idea the pleasures the past real life in
london which tallyhoho had been enabled to partake and during which
he again signified a desire to change the scene by a departure at
an early period for his native vales to breathe as he observed the
uncontaminated air the country to watch the wary pointer and mark
the rising covey to pursue the timid hare or chase the cunning
fox and dashall finding him inflexible notwithstanding his glowing
descriptions scenes yet unexplored at length consented to accompany
him to belville hall upon condition that they should return again ina
month this mode arrangement seemed perfectly satisfactory to bob
and a view the panorama and a peep at the tennis court would have
finished their rambles for the day but at the latter place 
amusement and healthful exercise meeting with young mortimer a further
development facts relative to sparkle and his bride transpired in
which it appeared that they had arrived at their place destination
and had forwarded an invitation to his brotherinlaw to pay them
an early visit and who proposed starting in a few days
well said dashall we will all go together and no doubt with our
old friend sparkle we shall be able to endure the unchanging prospects
 a country life
in the country how blest when it rains in the fields
to feast upon transports that shuttlecock yields
or go crawling from window to window to see
an ass on a common a crow on a tree
in the country you're nail'd like some pale in your park
to some stick a neighbour crammed into the ark
and if you are sick or in fits tumble down
you reach death ere the doctor can reach you from town
never mind cried tallyhoho a change scene will no doubt be useful
and at all events by enduring the one we may learn more judiciously
to appreciate the other
true said tom and i shall like myself all the better for being
in good company but pray mr mortimer what do you mean to do at the
approaching masquerade
not quite decided yet was the reply
you go course
certainly as orpheus or apollo but pray what character do you intend
to sustain
that's a secret 
worth knowing i suppose well well i shall find you out never
fear
time's a telltale said dashall and will most likely unfold all
mysteries but i always think the life and spirit a masquerade is
much injured by a knowledge the characters assumed by friends unless
it be where two or more have an intention playing as it were
to and with each other for where there is mystery there is always
interest i shall therefore propose that we keep to ourselves the
characters in which we mean to appear for i am determined if possible
to have a merry night it
on the lightly sportive wing
at pleasure's call we fly
hark they dance they play they sing
in merry merry revelry
hark the tabors lively beat
and the flute in numbers sweet
fill the night with delight
at the masquerade
let the grave ones warn us as they may
 every harmless joy afraid
whilst we're young and gay
we'll frolic and play
at the masquerade
 tom's observations upon this subject were in perfect accordance
with those mortimer and tallyhoho though he had intended to consult
his cousin as to the character he should appear in he now determined
to take his own direction or to have advice from centum in the strand
whose advertisements to supply dresses c he had observed in the
newspapers
these preliminaries being decided upon as far as appeared needful at
the moment mortimer departed towards home where he expected to meet
his uncle upon his return from the chase after the fugitives sparkle
and miss mortimer now mrs sparkle and tom and bob to piccadilly
where a select party dashall's friends were invited to dinner and
where they enjoyed a pleasant evening drank rather freely and had but
little to regret after it except certain qualmish feelings the head
and stomach the next morning
the anticipated masquerade had been the principal subject 
conversation so long as reason held her sway but the hard exercise 
the arm and the generosity the wine had an early and visible effect
upon some the party who did not separate till a late hour leaving
bob just strength and intelligence enough to find the way to his
dormitory
by the arrival the appointed evening for the grand masquerade at
vauxhall gardens tom dashall who had a particular view in keeping
his intended proceedings a secret had arranged all to his wishes and
anticipated considerable amusement from the interest he should take
in the safety his cousin whom he entertained no doubt quickly
discovering and with whom he determined to promote as much mirth as
possible
tallyhoho in the mean time had also made occasional calls upon merrywell
in his confinement and under his direction been preparing for the
occasion equally determined if ch was
the barber and which the sweep they were now suddenly attracted by a
grotesque dance between a clown the grimaldi school and a fancy old
woman in a garment patchwork made in an ancient fashion a red nose
long rows beads for earrings and a pair spectacles surmounted by
a high calledcap decorated with ribbons various hues rendered
her the most conspicuous character in the room and notwithstanding
her highheeled shoes she proved herself an excellent partner for the
clown
by this time bob who was anxious to carry his plan into execution
began to be fidgety and proposed a walk into the open air again as
they left the room his ears were attracted by the following song by a
watchman which he could not help stopping to catch and which afforded
his cousin an excellent opportunity giving him the slip
fly ye prigs for now's the hour
tho boosey kids have lost their power
when watchful charleys like the sun
their nightly course duty run
beneath the palefaced moon
 prigs pickpockets
 boosey kids drunken men
 charleys a cant term for watchmen
but take this warning while ye fly
that if you nibble click or clye
my sight's so dim i cannot see
unless while you the bluntly tip me
then stay then stay
for i shall make this music speak
and bring you up before the beak
unless the chink's in tune
now ye rambling sons night
or peepoday boys on your flight
well prim'd with jack or child tom's juice
while you the silver key produce
your safety then is clear
but snuffy and not up to snuff
you'll and your case is queer enough
shell out the nonsense half a quid
will speak more truth than all your whid
then go then go
for if you linger on your way
you'll for my music dearly pay
i'll quod you never fear
turning round with laughter from this character who had attracted many
hearers he look'd in vain for dashall and was not displeased to find
he had fled he therefore hastily withdrew from the scene merriment
and according to the instructions previously received and for which
he had prepared quickly changed his dress and appeared again in the
character a judge under the impression hinted by his counsellor
that the gravity his wig and gown with a steady countenance
 click a contraction the word clinker for a watch
 lye a pockethandkerchief
 blunt money
 music alluding to the rattle
 beak a magistrate
 peepoday boys staunch good ones reeling home after
the frolics the night
 silver key money which is thus termed as it is supposed
to open all places and all hearts
if you are sick and like to die
and for the doctor send
or have the cholic in your eye
still money is your friend is it not
 snuffy drunk
 up to snuffelevation ideas
 shell out the nonsense to pay money
 half a quid half a guinea
 whit words or talk
 would be a quiet and peaceable part to get through and shield
him from the torment those whom bob suspected willing to play tricks
with him should he be discovered here however he again found himself
at fait for he had scarcely entered the gardens before a host 
depredators were brought before him for trial the charleys brought in
succession drunken fiddlers tinkers and barbers and appeals were
made to his patience in so many voices and under so many varying
circumstances that justice was nearly running mad and poor tallyhoho
could find no chance making a reply an uproar from the approaching
crowd announced some more than ordinary culprit and in a moment who
should appear before him but a don giovanni and the hooking devil here
was a fine case for decision the devil claimed the don as his property
and addressed the representative justice as follows
most learned and puissant judge
protect my rights as you would the rights man i claim my property
and will have my claim allowed
hold replied bob if that is the case you have no occasion to
appeal to me begone black wretch and in thy native shades yell forth
thy discordant screams
most righteous judge a second daniel cried a bearded shylock with
his knife and scales he shan't escape me i'll have my bond so bare
his bosom next the heart let me come near him
this is playing the devil indeed said the don
by the powers cried a looney mackwolteb he's jump'd out the
fire into the fryingpan and when the slouched has done wit him he
may be drilled in his own fat
at this moment a leporello who caught the last words the irishman
burst into the presence the judge singing
zounds sir they'll grill you now lean or fat i know what games you
were always at and told you before what harm you would hatch now the
old gentleman's found you out he'll clap us all in the roundabout let
us be off ere they call for the watch
the word watch was reechoed in a thousand voices the vociferations 
the callers the noise the rattles and the laughter 
those immediately surrounding the judgmentseat offered so good an
opportunity for escape that giovanni determining to have another
chance burst from the grasp the arch enemy mankind to pursue
his wonted vagaries to the no small gratification bob who without
actually acquitting the prisoner rejoiced at his own escape
he had however scarcely time to congratulate himself before he was
annoyed by a postman in the usual costume whom he had already seen
delivering letters to the company the contents which appeared to
afford considerable amusement and who presenting a letter addressed
to the lord chief justice bunglecause in a moment disappeared breaking
open the envelope he read with astonishment the following lines
tho justice prevails
under big wigs and tails
you've not much law in your nob
so this warning pray take
your big wig forsake
and try a more modern scratch bob
go along bob lord chief justice bob in a scratch cried a waterman
at his elbow who had heard him reading in a voice loud enough to be
heard at some distance
there he'll be at home to a hair squeaked a little finicking
personification a modern peruquier sidling up to him picking his
teeth with a tortoiseshell comb
bob in bursting hastily away under the reiterated cries go along
bob lord chief justice bob with the idea overtaking the postman
found himself in a moment lock'd in the close embraces a meg
terrifies while a little bandylegg'd representative the late sir
jeffrey dunstan bawling out ould wigs ould wigs made a snatch at the
grave appendage justice and completely dismantled the head its
august representative this delayed him in his progress but it was
merely to witness the wig flying in the air with as much mirth to the
surrounding company as when the greasy nightcap the rev george
harvest was toss'd about the pit at the theatre each one giving it a
swing who could get within reach it thus mutilated in his 
apparel and probably conceiving according to the song
the wig's the thing the wig the wig
the wisdom's in the wig
bob tallyhoho took flight into a dressingroom declaring justice was
abroad and propriety not at home he was however rather at a loss as
in his last character he had not been able to meet with the turk but
determined to resume the search in a domino having therefore equipped
himself as a spectator he again sallied forth with intention to explore
the room and for a time remained comparatively unmolested but as he
could no where find his cousin he strolled indiscriminately among the
characters viewing whatever appeared amusing or interesting in his
way the fineness the weather greatly animated the scene and
gave increased brilliancy and effect to the illuminations which
were disposed in a numerous variety splendid devices representing
national trophies stars wreaths and crowns laurel it was the
first moment he had found an opportunity viewing the place in which
he had been acting
the amusements the evening were judiciously varied and protracted
by a constant succession entertainments various descriptions mr
chains exhibited many his most surprising deceptions in the rotunda
where also young gyngell displayed some capital performances on the
slackwire in the long room the celebrated fantoccini exhibition with
groupes quadrille dancers enlivened the scene in one walk the
garden mr gyngell's theatre arts was erected where were exhibited
balancing the ombres chinoises gymnastic exercises and other
feats and mr gyngell performed several airs on the musical glasses in
another punchinello delighted the beholders with his antics in a
third a very expert juggler played a variety clever tricks and
sleightoffhand deceptions and a couple itinerant italians exhibited
their musical and mechanical showboxes in another part the gardens
the celebrated diavolo antonio went through his truly astonishing
evolutions on the corde volante the duke gloucester's fine
military band occupied the grand orchestra an excellent quadrille band
played throughout the night in the long room while a scottish reel
band in the rotunda and a pandean band in the gardens played
alternately reels waltzes and country dances
this interval peace was truly acceptable to bob and he did not fail
to make the most it roving like the bee from one delight to another
sipping pleasure as he went almost regretting he had not taken the last
dress first though he was every now and then importuned by mendicants
and servant girls very desirous to obtain places all work the
introduction a dancing bear who appeared to possess more christian
qualities than his leader attracted his attention but in pressing to
the scene action he received a floored from a bruiser in gloves who
milled indiscriminately all who came in his way till the bear took the
shine out him by a fraternal embrace and his leader very politely
asked those around which they thought the greater bear the two upon
rising bob found himself in the hands two itinerant quack doctors
each holding an arm and each feeling for his pulse one declared the
case was mortal a dislocation the neck had taken place and there
was no chance preserving life except by amputation the head
the other shook his head look'd grave pull'd out his lancet and
prescribed phlebotomy and warm water
bob who had received no injury except a little contusion occasioned by
the blow seized the ignorant practitioners by the throat and knocking
their heads together exclaimed with a stentorian voice
throw physic to the clogs i'll none on't go along bob was
repeated again as loud and as long as before he however burst from
those around him in pursuit fresh game nor was he disappointed for
he presently found a dapper young clergyman in gown and surplice
and who with in hand was fervently engaged in exhortations and
endeavours to turn from the evil their ways a drunken sailor and
a hardened thief the arson the iron chest when the group were
surrounded by a detachment the imps and devils giovanni in london
a truly horrid and diabolical crew who by their hideous yells frantic
capers violent gestures and the flaring their torches scared the
affrighted parson from his task made his intended penitents their own
and became an almost intolerable nuisance to the rest the
company for the remainder the evening
while he was thus engaged the supperboxes were thrown open and the
company appeared to be all on the move towards the more substantial
entertainments the evening he was next suddenly detained by a jew
pedlar who was anxious to shew him his wares
get out slouched said bob
ant is dat all vat you can say to a poor honest jew what wants to
live by his trade for vye you trow my religions in my teeth i'm so
honest vat i never cheats nobody will you puy a gould l vat you
take for your gown i shall puy or sell it's all the same to me
now whatsoever country by chance i travel through tis all the same to
i so the monies but comes in some people call me ties just because i
am a jew so to make them tell the truth vy i thinks there is no sin so
i shows them all mine coots vic a sober winning grace and i sometimes
picks dere pockets whilst they're smiling in my face
bob laugh'd but declared he'd have nothing to do with him
then said the hon tom dashall you may go along bob
what is it possible i have been looking for you these two hours
i can't eat pork said dashall resuming his character
come along said bob happy to find his relation and catching him
by the arm they proceeded to refreshment and partook an excellent
supper cold viands plentifully supplied and accompanied with a
profusion ices and jellies served up in a style highly creditable to
the managers
here they were joined by mortimer who had been as frolicsome as any imp
in the gardens in the character the devil but who had lost sight
 the dandy officer and the nun whom he had so ingeniously hooked
together the wine was good and after enjoying their repast tom
and mortimer enshrined themselves in dominos for the remainder 
the evening the usual masquerade frolics and dancing were afterwards
continued and about five in the morning they left this region fun
mirth and good humour
chapter xxvii
that life is a picture strange things and ways
a grand exhibition each hour displays
and for london there's no place can with it compare
tis a jumble every thing curious and rare
cheapside bustlers fleet street hostlers
jockeys doctors agents proctors
bow street sanguis bond street sanguis
hide and seekers opera squeers
lawyers tailors bailiffs jailors
shorten butlers alderman gutters
patriot talkers sunday walkers
dancers actors jews contractors
placemen croakers boxers brokers
swindlers coroners spies and foreigners
and all all to keep up the bubble strife
and prove ways and means is the picture life
the bustle and merriment the masquerade were long remembered in the
mind bob tallyhoho and furnished frequent conversations between him
and his cousin and the laughable occurrences the evening in which
they had been engaged were reenjoyed in recollection notwithstanding
the preparations they were making for an excursion another kind
in the country which though not exactly to the taste dashall was
inflexibly persevered in by tallyhoho
tom tried every effort in his power to prolong the appointed period
 departure in again the heart and mind his cousin appeared to
be occupied with anticipated delights which he described in the most
glowing colours imagination the healthful fields the enlivening fox
chase and the sportive exercises a country life were detailed with
ecstacy and though last not least the additional zest for the more
attractive scenes in tom's idea that would present themselves for
inspection upon a return to the metropolis at length it was fi
buildings at a distance where they were scarcely discernible by the
naked eye bob was delighted with the view greenwich hospital and
the account which his cousin gave him the establishment and upon
descending they took a complete walk round this celebrated pillar
marking its decorations and reading the inscription
it is said tom a fluted column the doric order the total height
is feet the diameter at the base feet and the height the
column feet the cone at the top with its urn are feet the
height the massy pedestal is feet there are steps inside
but continued he ait is really a great pity that this beautiful
monument should be in such a confined situation for in a proper
place it would form one the most striking objects the kind that
architecture is capable producing
the inscription it is true continued dashall had better be erased
it contains a libel or more properly a lie which almost contradicts
itself for no rational being can entertain the notion that the
catholics or indeed any religious sect could wilfully have perpetrated
so horrible a deed as this pillar was intended to impute to them nor
can so much credit be given to human foresight as for it to be concluded
that a fire which broke out in a single house could upon this rather
than upon other occasions have extended its ravages in so extraordinary
a manner
 while we arc on the spot we will take a peep at a curious piece
 antiquity not that i am so great a lover such curiosities but it
would appear almost unpardonable for you to have been in london without
seeing london stone
i have heard it said tallyhoho and if we are near let us have a
view
come on then said dashall this same london stone is at present
fixed close under the south wall st swithin's church cannon
street it has by some been supposed british origin a kind solemn
boundary or some other object probably a religious nature which
through every change and convulsion the state has been preserved with
reverential care but this is the very place said he
bob stared about him with surprise to discover this curious and
apparently valuable relic without finding it till at length his
cousin directed his attention to the spot which at present is under a
pitchingblock or restingplace for persons carrying heavy loads and
almost burst into laughter for he had raised his cousin's expectation
by the previous description
how said tallyhoho and is this your curiosity
even so replied tom that is the celebrated london stone it
formerly stood nearer the middle the street was placed deep in the
ground and strongly fixed with iron bars according to account the
first mention it was in the reign athelstan king the west
saxons and it has been usually viewed by our antiquaries as a military
stone from which the romans began the computation their miles a
conjecture which certainly appears very reasonable not only from the
discovery the roman road after the year running directly to
this stone from watling street but from the exact coincidence which its
distance bears with the neighbouring station mentioned in antoine's
itinerary the principal whose journeys either begin or with
london
the sound a horn interrupted this conversation
apropos said tom we can take the post office in our way a place 
considerable importance so allons
they now pursued their way to lombard street
this collection buildings said dashall as they entered
important as its concerns are to the nation claims no praise as a
building it stands behind lombard street from which on the
south side the street there is a passage leading to it under an
arched gateway
a plan has however been adopted for erecting a building worthy 
this great establishment on the site now called st martin'slegrand
and to improve the access to it by pulling down the east ends newgate
street and paternosterrow it is now proceeding rapidly
the postoffice system is however one the most perfect regulations
 finance and convenience existing under any government it has
gradually been brought to its present perfection being at first in the
hands individuals and replete with abuses in its present form it
not only supplies the government with a great revenue but accomplishes
that by means highly beneficial to the persons contributing
the postoffice is the most important spot on the surface the globe
it receives information from all countries it distributes instructions
to the antipodes it connects together more numerous and distant
interests men than any similar establishment it is in the highest
degree hitherto realized the seat terrestrial perception and
volition the brain the whole earth and hitherto it has been in a
narrow valley misshapen even to deformity and scarcely accessible to
the few mail coaches which collect there for their nightly freights
the present postoffice was erected in but great additions have
been made to it from time to time though the whole is disjointed and
inconvenient
the mode carrying letters by the general post was greatly improved
a few years since by a most admirable plan invented by mr palmer
previously to its adoption letters were conveyed by carts without
protection from robbery and subject to delays at present they are
carried according to mr palmer's plan by coaches distinguished
by the name mailcoaches provided with a wellarmed guard and
forwarded at the rate eight miles an hour including stoppages
government contracts with coachkeepers merely for carrying the mail
the coachowner making a profitable business besides carrying
passengers and parcels it is not easy to imagine a combination 
different interests to one purpose more complete than this the
wretched situation however the horses on account the length
 the stages which they are frequently driven is a disgrace to the
character the british nation and requires the interference 
the legislature no stage should exceed twelve miles in length
the rapidity this mode conveyance is unequalled in any country
and the present rate charge for each passenger is little more than
sixpence per mile
houses having boxes for receiving letters before five o'clock are
open in every part the metropolis and after that hour bellmen
collect the letters during another hour receiving a fee one penny
for each letter but at the general postoffice in lombard street
letters are received till seven o'clock after which time till half an
hour after seven a fee sixpence must be paid and from half after
seven till a quarter before eight the postage must also be paid as
well as the fee sixpence
well said tallyhoho for a place such public utility and constant
resort i must confess i expected to see a building the most
magnificent kind but i am also puzzled to conceive how such extensive
business can be carried on with so much regularity as it is
your observation replied his cousin exactly coincides with that
 many others but you will some day or other be as much surprised
on other subjects for there are places in london where mercantile and
legal business is conducted in situations obscurity which you can
have no conception but as a national establishment though its internal
regulations are good its external appearance is no recommendation toit
but come let us proceed towards home i have a call or two to make
on the road for as we depart quickly for the open fields and are to
bid adieu to london smoke as well as london stone we have but little
time to spare so let us post away
bob alive to this subject did not require a second hint but taking
the arm dashall they proceeded along cheapside made a call at
mortimer's the gunsmith's on lydgate hill provided themselves withall
necessary shooting apparatus and tom ever mindful the variety
which he conceived would be needful to render rusticity agreeable on
their way purchased a pair boxing gloves a backgammon board and
other amusing articles to provide as he said against a rainy day
on arrival at home they were presented with a letter from sparkle
announcing his arrival at his new mansion and expressing a hope that he
should have the pleasure meeting his friends within a day or
two expatiating with great apparent delight upon the happiness his
own situation and promising lots amusement in detailing to them the
events his peregrinations this operated as an additional spur to the
speed their departure and it was agreed that they should start the
next morning
i don't know said bob whether i should really like a continued
life in london i have seen many its comforts and many its

with what unequal tempers are we form'd
one day the soul elate and satisfied
revels secure and fondly tells herself
the hour evil can return no more
the next the spirit pall'd and sick riot
turns all to discord and we hate our being
curse our past joys and think them folly all
matter and motion say philosophers are inseparable and the
doctrine appears equally applicable to the human mind our country
squire anxious to testify a grateful sense the attentions paid
him during his london visit had assiduously exerted himself since his
return in contributing to the pleasures and amusements his visitors
and belville hall presented a scene festive hospitality at once
creditable to its liberal owner and gratifying to the numerous gentry
 the surrounding neighbourhood
but however varied and numerous the sports and recreations rural
life however refined and select the circle its society they
possessed not the endless round metropolitan amusement nor those
evervarying delights produced amid the busy hum men where every
street is replete with incident and character and every hour fraught
with adventure
satiety had now evidently obtruded itself amid the party and its
attendants lassitude and restlessness were not long in bringing up the
rear the impression already made upon the mind bob by the cursory
view he had taken life in london was indelible and it required
little persuasion on the part his cousin the hon tom dashall
to induce him again to return to scenes so much delight and which
afforded such inexhaustible stores amusement to an ardent and
youthful curiosity
a return to the metropolis having therefore been mutually agreed
upon and every previous arrangement being completed the squire once
more abdicated for a season his paternal domains and accompanied by
his cousin dashall and the whole cidevant party belville hall
arrived safe at the elegant mansion the latter where they planned
a new system perambulation having for its object a further
investigation manners characters objects and incidents connected
with real life in london 
come cried dashall one fine morning starting up immediately after
breakfast
rouse for fresh game and away let us haste
the regions to roam wit fashion and taste
like quixote in quest adventures set out
and learn what the crowds in the streets are about
and laugh when we must and approve when we can
where london displays ev'ry feature man
the numerous hotels bagnios taverns inns coffeehouses
eatinghouses lodginghouses c in endless variety which meet
the eye in all parts the metropolis afford an immediate choice
 accommodation as well to the temporary sojourner as the permanent
resident where may be obtained the necessaries and luxuries life
commensurate with your means payment from one shilling to a guinea
for a dinner and from sixpence to thirty shillings a night for a
lodging
the stranger recommended to one these hotels who regales himself
after the fatigues a journey with moderate refreshment and retires
to rest and preparing to depart in the morning is frequently surprised
at the longitudinal appearance and sum total his bill wherein every
item is individually stated and at a rate enormously extravagant
remonstrance is unavailable the charges are those common to the house
and in failure payment your luggage is under detention without
the means redress ultimately the bill must be paid and the only
consolation left is that you have acquired a useful though
expensive lesson how to guard in future against similar exaction and
inconvenience
 marlborough street yesterday mrs hickinbottom the
wife mr hickinbottom the keeper the st petersburg
hotel in dover street piccadilly appeared to a summons to
answer the complaint a gentleman for unlawfully detaining
his luggage under the following circumstances the
complainant stated that on thursday evening last on his
arrival in town from aberdeen he went to the white horse
cellar piccadilly but the house being full he was
recommended to the st petersburg hotel in dover street
where having taken some refreshment and wrote a letter he
went to bed and on the following morning after breakfast
he desired the waiter to bring him his bill which he did
and the first item that presented itself was the moderate
charge one pound ten shillings for his bed and then
followed amongst many others sixpence for a pen a
shilling for wax a shilling for the light and two and
sixpence for other lights so that the bill amounted in the
whole to the sum two pounds one shilling for his night's
lodging to this very exorbitant charge he had refused to
submit in consequence which he had been put to great
inconvenience by the detention his luggage the
magistrate animadverted with much severity on such
extravagant charges on the part the tavernkeeper and
advised that upon the gentleman paying fifteen shillings
the things might be immediately delivered up to these
terms however mrs hickinbottom refused to accede adding
at the same time that the gentleman had only been charged
the regular prices the house and that she should insist
upon the whole amount the bill being paid for that the
persons who were in the habit coming to their house never
objected to such the regular price their lodgings being
ten guineas per week the magistrate lamented that he had
no power to enforce the things being given up but he
recommended the complainant to bring an action against the
tavernkeeper for the detention
 these were the observations directed by dashall to his friend
as they passed one morning the hotel de la sabloniere in leicester
square
doubtless he continued in those places affluent resort the
accommodations are in the first style excellence yet with reference
to comfort and sociability were i a country gentleman in the habit 
occasionally visiting london my temporary domicile should be the snug
domesticated coffeehouse economical in its charges and pleasurable in
the variety its visitors where i might at will extend or abridge
my evening intercourse and in the retirement my own apartment feel
myself more at home than in the vacuum an hotel
the attention our perambulators in passing through the square was
attracted by a fine boy apparently about eight years age dressed in
mourning who at the door brunet's hotel was endeavouring withall
his little strength and influence to oppose the egress a large
newfoundland dog that indignant restraint seemed desirous in a
strange land introducing himself to canine good fellowship the
boy whose large dark eyes were full animation and his countenance
though bronzed interestingly expressive remonstrated with the dog in
the french language the animal does not understand you exclaimed
tallyhoho in the vernacular idiom the youth speak to him in
english he must be a clever dog answered the boy to know english
so soon for neither him nor i have been in england above a week and
for the first time in our lives and how is it asked tallyhoho
that you speak the english language so fluently o said the little
fellow my mother taught it me she is an english woman and for that
reason i love the english and am much fonder talking their language
than my own there was something extremely captivating in the boy the
dog now struggling for freedom was nearly effecting his release
when the two friends interposed their assistance and secured the
premeditating fugitive at the moment when to inquire the cause the
bustle the father the child made his appearance in the person
 field marshal count bertrand the count possessing all the
characteristics a gentleman acknowledged politely the kind attention
 the strangers to his son while on the other hand they returned
his obeisance with the due respect excited by his uniform friendship and
undeviating attachment to greatness in adversity the discerning eye
 field marshal bertrand justly appreciated the superior rank the
strangers to whom he observed that during the short period he had then
been in england he had experienced much courtesy which he should
always retain a grateful recollection this accidental interview was
creative reciprocal satisfaction and the parties separated not
without an invitation on the part the boy that his newly found
acquaintances would again visit the friends the emperor
 lines supposed to have been written by
the exemperor napoleon in his last illness
too slowly the tide existence recedes
for him in captivity destined to languish
the exile abandon'd fortune who needs
the friendship death to obviate his anguish
yet even his last moments unmet by a sigh
napoleon the great uncomplaining shall die
though doom'd on thy rock st helena to close
my life that once presag'd ineffable glory
unvisited here though my ashes repose
no tablet to tell the lone exile's sad story
napoleon buonaparte still shall the name
exist on the records immortal fame
posterity tracing the annals france
the merits will own her potent defender
her greatness preeminent skill'd to advance
creating sustaining her zenith splendour
who patroniz'd arts and averted alarms
till crush'd by the union nations in arms
i yield to my fate nor should memory bring
one moment fruitless and painful reflection
 what i was lately an emperor and king
unless for the bitter yet fond recollection
 those who my heart's best endearments have won
remote from my deathbed my consort and son
denied in their arms even to breathe my last sigh
no relatives solace my exit attending
with strangers sojourning midst strangers i die
no tear regret with the last duties blending
to him the lorn exile no obsequies paid
whose fiat a universe lately obey'd
make there then my tomb where the willow trees wave
and far in the island the streamlet meanders
if ever by stealth to my green grassy grave
some kind musing spirit sympathy wanders
here rests he will say from adversity's pains
napoleon buonaparte's mortal remains
we have no disposition to enter into the character the
deceased exemperor history will not fail to do justice
alike to the merits and the crimes one who is inevitably
destined to fill so portentous a page on its records at the
present time to speak the good which he may have been
either the intentional or the involuntary instrument
without some bias party feeling would be impossible
hard is his fate on whom the public gaze
is fix'd for ever to condemn or praise
repose denies her requiem to his name
and folly loves the martyrdom fame
at all events he is now no more and an english spirit
wars not with the dead
the count said dashall to his cousin as they pursued their walk
remains in england until he obtain permission from the king 
france to return to his native country that such leave will be given
there is little doubt the meritorious fidelity which the count has
uniformly exemplified to his late unfortunate and exiled master
has obtained for him universal esteem and the king france is too
generous to withhold amidst the general feeling his approbation
passing through long acre in their progress towards the british museum
to which national establishment they had cards admission the two
friends were intercepted in their way by a concourse at a coachmaker's
shop fronting which stood a chariot carefully matted round the
body firmly sewed together and the wheels enveloped in haybands
preparatory to its being sent into the country scarcely had these
precautionary measures safety been completed when a shrill cry
as if by a child inside the vehicle was heard loud and continuation
which after the lapse some minutes broke out into the urgent and
reiterated exclamation let me out i shall be suffocated pray
let me out
the workmen who had packed up the carriage stared at each other in
mute and appalling astonishment they felt conscious that no child was
within the vehicle and when at last they recovered from the stupor 
amazement they resisted the importunity the multitude to strip the
chariot and manfully swore that if any one was inside it must bethe
devil himself or one his imps and no human or visible being
whatsoever
some the multitude were inclined to a similar opinion the
crowd increased and the most intense interest was depicted in every
countenance when the cry let me out i shall die for heaven's
sake let me out was audibly and vehemently again and again repeated
the impatient multitude now began to cut away the matting when the
workmen apprehensive that the carriage might sustain some damage from
the impetuosity their proceedings took upon themselves the act 
dismantling the mysterious machine during which operation the cry 
let me out became more and more clamorously importunate at last
the vehicle was laid bare and its door thrown open when to the utter
amazement the crowd no child was there no trace was to be seen 
aught human or superhuman the assemblage gazed on the vacant
space from whence the sounds had emanated in confusion and dismay
during this momentary suspense in which the country squire
participated a voice from some invisible agent as if descending the
steps the carriage exclaimed thank you my good friends i am very
much obliged to you i shall now go home and where my home is you will
all know byandby
with the exception dashall and tallyhoho the minds the spectators
previously impressed with the legends superstition and diablerie
gave way under the dread the actual presence his satanic majesty
and the congregated auditors his ominous denunciation instantaneously
dispersed themselves from the scene witchery and reassembling in
groupes on distant parts the street cogitated and surmised on the
devil's visit to the coachmakers long acre
tallyhoho now turned an inquisitive eye on his cousin who answered the
silent and anxious enquiry with an immoderate fit laughter declaring
that this was the best and most ingenious hoax any he had ever
witnessed and that he would not have missed on any consideration
whatsoever the pleasure enjoying it the devil in long acre i
shall never forget it exclaimed the animated cousin the staring and
discomfited squire
explain explain reiterated the squire impatiently
you shall have it in one wordanswered dashall ventriloquism
 this hoax was actually practised by a ventriloquist in the
manner described it certainly is a less offensive nature
than that many others which have been successfully
brought forward in the metropolis the offspring folly
and idleness a fellow some years ago certainly not 
infinite humour considering an elderly maiden lady 
berne street a fit and proper subject on whom to
exercise his wit was at the trouble writing a vast
number letters to tradesmen and others magistrates and
professional men ordering from the former various goods
and requiring the advice in a case emergency the
latter appointing the same hour to all attendance so
that in fact at the time mentioned the street to the
annoyonce and astonishment its inhabitants was crowded
with a motley group visitants equestrian and pedestrian
all eagerly pressing forward to their destination the old
lady's place residence in the heterogeneous assemblage
there were seen tradesmen all denominations accompanied
by their porters bearing various articles household
furniture counsellors anticipating fees lawyers engaged
to execute the last will and testament the heroine the
drama and not the least conspicuous an undertaker
preceded by his man with a coffin and to crown the whole
though last not least in our esteem the then lord mayor 
london who at the eager desire the old lady had with
a commendable feeling humanity left his civic dominions
in order to administer in a case danger and difficulty
his consolation and assistance when behold the clue was
unravelled the whole turn'd out an hoax and the author
still remains in nubibus
 and who could have been the artist enquired tallyhoho
nay answered his friend that is impossible to say some one in the
crowd but the secret must remain with himself neither do i think it
would have been altogether prudent his revealing it to his alarmed and
credulous auditory
a ventriloquist observed the squire is so little known in the
country that i had lost all reminiscence his surprising powers
however i shall in future from the occurrence today resist
the obtrusion superstition and in all cases doubtful dilemma
remember the devil in long acrel
well resolved answered dashall and in a few minutes they
gained great russel street bloomsbury without further incident or
interruption
 the child in the hat not long since a waggoner coming
to town with a load hay was overtaken by a stranger who
entered into familiar conversation with him they had not
proneeded far when to the great terror giles jolt a
plaintive cry apparently that a child issued from the
waggon didst hear that mon exclaimed giles the cry was
renewed lord lord an there be na a babe neath the
hay i've be hanged lend us a hand mon to get un out for
god's sake the stranger very promptly assisted in
unloading the waggon but no child was found the hay now
lay in a heap on the road from whence the cry was once more
long and loudly reiterated in eager research giles next
proceeded to scatter the hay over the road the cry still
continuing but when at last he ascertained that the
assumed infantine plaint was all a delusion his hair stood
erect with horror and running rapidly from his companion
announced that he had been associated on the road by the
devil for that none else could play him such a trick it
was not without great difficulty that the people to whom he
told this strange story prevailed on him to return at last
to his waggon and horses he did so with manifest
reluctance to his indescribable relief his infernal
companion hail vanished in the person the ventriloquist
and jolt still believes in the supernatural visitation
 amongst the literary and scientific institutions the metropolis
the british museum situated in great russel street bloomsbury stands
preeminent
entering the spacious court our two friends found a party in waiting
for the conductor the individuals composing this party the
reconnoitering eye dashall observed a trio from whence he
anticipated considerable amusement it was a family triumvirate formed
 an old bachelor whose cent per cent ideas predominated over every
other wheresoever situated or howsoever employed his maiden sister
prim starch and antiquated and their hopeful nephew a
complete coxcomb that is in full possession the requisite
concomitants ignorance and impudence and arrayed in the first style 
the most exquisite dandyism this delectable triumviri had emerged from
their chaotic recess in harbingerlane the exquisite to exhibit his
sweet person along with the other curiosities the museum his maiden
aunt to see as she expressed it the hegipsyian muniments
covered with kerrygleefix and her brother to ascertain whether
independent outlandish baubles gimcracks and gewgaws there was anything
 substantiality with which to enhance the per contra side in the
account current between the british museum and the public
attaching themselves to this respectable trio dashall and tallyhoho
followed with the other visitants the guide whose duty it that
day was to point out the various curiosities this great national
institution
the british museum was established by act parliament in in
pursuance the will sir hans sloane who left his museum to
the nation on condition that parliament should pay l to his
executors and purchase a house sufficiently commodious for it the
parliament acted with great liberality on the occasion several other
valuable collections were united to that sir hans sloane and the
whole establishment was completed for the sum l raised by
lottery at the institution this grand treasury learning it
was proposed that a competent part l the annual sum granted by
parliament for the support the house should be appropriated for
the purchase new books but the salaries necessary for the officers
together with the contingent expenses have always exceeded the
allowance so that the trustees have been repeatedly obliged to
make application to defray the necessary charges
mr timothy surety the before mentioned harbingerlane resident
 cent per cent rumination his accomplished sister tabitha his
exquisite nephew jasper and the redoubtable heroes our eventful
history were now associated in one party and the remaining visitants
were sociably amalgamated in another and each having its separate
conductor both proceeded to the inspection the first and most
valuable collection in the universe
illustration pages british museum
on entering the gate the first objects which attracted attention
were two large sheds defending from the inclemency the seasons a
collection egyptian monuments the whole which were taken from
the french at alexandria in the last war the most curious these
perhaps is the large sarcophagus beneath the shed to the left which
has been considered as the exterior coffin alexander the great used
at his final interment it is formed variegated marble and as mrs
tabitha surety observed was covered with kerrygleefix 
nephew jasper said his uncle you are better acquainted with the
nomenclature i think you call it them there thingumbobs than i
am what is the name this here
my dear sir rejoined the exquisite this here is called a sark o
fergus implying the domicile or rather the windingsheet the
dead as the sark or chemise wound itself round the fair forms the
daughters o'fegus a highland chieftain from whom descended philip
 macedon father alexander the great and thence originated the
name subsequently given by the highland laird's successors to the
dormitory the dead the sark o fergus or in the corruption modern
orthography sarcophagus
timothy surety cast an approving glance towards his nephew and
whispering dashall my nephew sir apparently a puppy sir but well
informed nevertheless what think you his definition that hard
word is he not i mean my nephew jaz a most extraordinary young man
superlatively so answered dashall and i think you are happy in
bearing affinity to a young man such transcendent acquirements
d n his acquirements exclaimed timothy would you think it
they are no use in the way trade and though i have given him many
an opportunity doing well he knows no more keeping a set books
by doubleentry than timothy surety does keeping a pack hounds
who was never twenty miles beyond the hearing bow bells in all his
lifetime
this important communication having been made apart from the
recognition the aunt and nephew passed on their approach
unanswered and dashall and his friend remained in doubt whether or not
the nephew in his late definition the word sarcophagus was in
jest or earnest tallyhoho inclined to think that he was hoaxing the old
gentleman on the other hand his cousin bethought himself that the
apparent ingenuity jaz's definition was attributable entirely to his
ignorance
here also were two statues roman workmanship supposed to be those
 marcus aurelius and severus ancient but evidently provincial
sculpture
mrs tabitha shading her eyes with her fan and casting a glance askew
at the two naked figures which exhibited the perfection symmetry
enquired her nephew who they were meant to represent
his answer was equally eccentric with that accorded to his uncle on the
subject the sarcophagus
my dear madam said jaz these two figures are consanguineous to
those gog and magog in guildhall being the lineal descendants 
these mighty associates the livery london
but jaz rejoined the antique dame i always understood that
messieurs gog and magog derived their origin from quite a different
family
aunt mine responded jaz the lofty rubicund civic baronet
shall not be shorn his beams he claims the same honour with
his brainless brothers before ushe is a scion the same tree sir
wllm the twin brothers guildhall and these two sedate gentlemen
 stone all boast the honour the same extraction
behind them on the right was a ram's head very curious workmanship
from thebes
perhaps sir said mrs tabitha graciously addressing herself to
squire tallyhoho you can inform us what may be the import this
singular exhibition
on my honour madam answered the squire i cannot satisfactorily
resolve the enquiry i am a country gentleman and though
conversant with rains and rams horns in my own neighbourhood have no
knowledge them with reference to the connexion the latter with the
citizens london or westminster
jaz again assumed the office expositor my very reverend aunt
said jaz i must prolegomena the required explanation with a simple
anecdote
when charles the second returned from one his northern tours
accompanied by the earl rochester he passed through shoreditch on
each side the road was a huge pile rams horns for what purpose
tradition saith not what is the meaning all this asked the
king pointing towards the symbolic i know not rejoined rochester
unless it implies that the citizens london have laid their heads
together to welcome your majesty's return in commemoration this
witticism the ram's head is to the citizens london a prominent
feature exhibition in the british museum
this interpretation raised a laugh at the expense timothy surety
who nevertheless bore it with great good humour being a bachelor and
consequently not within the scope that ridicule on the basis which
was founded the present sarcastic fabric
it was now obvious to dash all and his friend that this young man
jasper surety was not altogether the ignoramus at first presumed they
had already been entertained by his remarks and his annotations were
 a description to warrant the expectancy further amusement in the
progress their inspection
from the hall the visitors were led through an iron gateway to the
great staircase opposite the bottom which is preserved a model in
mahogany exhibiting the method used by mr milne in constructing the
works blacksmiths bridge and beneath it are some curious fragments
from the giant's causeway in ireland
these fragments however highly estimated by the naturalist and the
antiquary were held in derision by the worldlyminded tim surety
who exclaimed against the folly expending money in the purchase 
articles no intrinsic value calculated only to gratify the curiosity
 those inquisitive idlers who affect their admiration every
uninteresting production nature and neglect the pursuit the main
chance so necessary in realizing the comforts life
 these sordid ideas were opposed by dashall and the squire to
whom they seemed particularly directed mrs tabitha smiled a gracious
acquiescence in the sentiments the two strangers and jasper
expressed his regret that nuncle was not gifted and fated as midas 
ancient times who transformed every thing that he touched into gold
the egyptian and etruscan antiquities next attracted the attention 
the visitors over a doorway in this room is a fine portrait sir
william hamilton painted by sir joshua reynolds dashall and tallyhoho
remarked with enthusiasm on these beautiful relics the sculpture
 former ages several which were mutilated and disfigured by the
dilapidation time and accident the company present there stood
on the left a diminutive elderly gentleman in the act contemplating
the fragment a statue in a posterior position and which certainly
exhibited somewhat a ludicrous appearance on the right the
exquisite jasper pointed out with the selfsufficiency an amateur
the masculine symmetry a colossian statue to his aunt antiquated
virginity whose maiden purity recoiling from the view notation
seemed to say jaz wrap an apron round him while in the foreground
stood the rotundity form timothy surety who declared after a
cursory and contemptuous glance at the venerable representatives 
mythology that with the exception the portrait sir william
hamilton there was not in the room an object worth looking at and as
for them there ancient statutes such was his vernacular idiom and
harbinger barbarism i would not give twopence for the whole this
here collection if it was never for nothing else than to set them up as
scarecrows in the garden my country house at edmonton
jasper whispered his aunt that nuncks was a vile bore and the
sacrilegious declaration gave great offence to the diminutive gentleman
aforesaid who hesitated not in pronouncing timothy surety destitute 
taste and vertu to which accusation timothy rearing his squat form
to its utmost altitude indignantly replied that there was not an
alderman in the city london better taste than himself in the
qualities callipash and calliope and that if the little penmen
presumed again to asperse his virtue he would bring an action against
him tor slander and defamation character the minikin man gave
timothy a glance ineffable disdain and left the room mrs 
tabitha in the full consciousness her superior acquirements now
directed a lecture edification to her brother who however manfully
resisted her interference and swore that where his taste and
virtue were called in question he would not submit to any she in the
universe
mrs tabitha finding that on the present occasion her usual success
would not predominate suspended like a skilful manoeuvres
unavailable attack and turning to her nephew variety 
shapes than proteus and that he had been only fifty times if not more
confined in different houses correction as an incorrigible rogue
and vagabond from one which he had recently contrived to effect his
escape the officer now bore off his prize in triumph while dashall
hitherto the most observant all observers sustained the laugh
 his cousin at the knowing one deceived with great good humour and
dashall adverting to his opinion so confidently expressed there can
be no deception here declared that in london it was impossible to
guard in every instance against fraud where it is frequently practised
with so little appearance imposition
the two friends now bent their course towards covent garden which
reaching without additional incident they wiled away an hour at
robins's much to their satisfaction that gentleman in his professional
capacity generally attracts in an eminent degree the attention his
visitors by his professional politeness so that he seldom fails to
put off an article to advantage and yet he rarely resorts to the puff
direct and never indulges in the puff figurative so much practised by
his renowned predecessor the late knight the hammer christie the
elder who by the superabundance his rhetorical flurishes was
accustomed from his elevated rostrum to edify and amuse his admiring
auditory
 the immense revenues accruing to his grace the duke bedford
not the least important is that derived from covent garden market as
proprietor the ground from every possessor a shed or stall and
from all who take their station as venders in the market a rent is
payable to his grace and collected weekly considering therefore
the vast number occupants the aggregate rental must be the first
magnitude his grace is a humane landlord and his numerous tenantry
 covent garden are always ready to join in general eulogium on his
private worth as is the nation at large on the patriotism his public
character
dashall conducted his friend through every part the market amidst a
redundancy fruit flowers roots and vegetables native and exotic
in variety and profusion exciting the merited admiration the
squire who observed and perhaps justly that this celebrated emporium
unquestionably is not excelled by any other a similar description in
the universe
 the late mr christie having at one time a small tract 
land under the hammer expatiated at great length on its
highly improved state the exuberant beauties with which
nature had adorned this terrestrial paradise and more
particularly specified a delightful hanging wood
a gentleman unacquainted with mr christie's happy talent
at exaggerated description became the highest bidder paid
his deposit and posted down into essex to examine his new
purchase when to his great surprise and disappointment he
found no part the description realized the promised
paradise having faded into an airy vision and left not a
wreck behind the irritated purchaser immediately returned
to town and warmly expostulated with the auctioneer on the
injury he had sustained by unfounded representation and as
to a hanging wood sir there is not the shadow a tree on
the spot i beg your pardon sir said the pertinacious
eulogist you must certainly have overlooked the gibbet on
the common and if that is not a hanging wood i know not
what it is
another mr christie's flights fancy may not unaptly
be termed the puff poetical at an auction pictures
dwelling in his usual strain eulogium on the unparalleled
excellence a fulllength portrait without his producing
the desired effect gentlemen said he cannot injustice
to this sublime art permit this most invaluable
painting to pass from under the hammer without again
soliciting the honour your attention to its manifold
beauties gentlemen it only wants the touch prometheus
to start from the canvass and fall bidding
 proceeding into leicester square the very extraordinary
production female genius miss logwood's gallery needlework
promised a gratification to the squire exceeding in novelty any thing
which he had hitherto witnessed in the metropolis the two
friends accordingly entered and the anticipations tallyhoho were
superabundantly realized
this exhibition consists seventyfive exquisite copies in needlework
 the finest pictures the english and foreign schools possessing
all the correct drawing just colouring light and shade the original
pictures from whence they are taken and to which in point effect
they are in no degree inferior
from the door in leicester square the visitants entered the principal
room a fine gallery excellent proportions hung with scarlet
broadcloth gold bullion tassels and greek borders the appearance
thus given to the room is pleasing and indicated to the squire a still
more superior attraction his cousin dashall had frequently inspected
this celebrated exhibition but to tallyhoho it was entirely new
on one side this room the pictures are hung and have a guard in
front to keep the company at the requisite distance and for preserving
them
turning to the left a long and obscure passage prepares the mind
and leads to the cell a prison on looking into which is seen the
beautiful lady jane gray visited by the abbot and keeper the tower
the night before her execution
this scene particularly elicited the squire's admiration the deception
 the whole he observed was most beautiful and not exceeded by
any work from the pencil the painter that he had ever witnessed
a little farther on is a cottage the casement which opens and the
hatch at the door is closed and on looking in at either our visitants
perceived a fine and exquisitely finished copy gainsborough's cottage
children standing by the fire with chimneypiece and cottage furniture
compleat near to this is gainsborough's woodman exhibited in the same
scenic manner
having enjoyed an intellectual treat which perhaps in originality as
an exhibition needlework is no where else to be met with our
perambulators retired and reached home without the occurrence any
other remarkable incident

look round thee young astolpho here's the place
which men for being poor are sent to starve in
rude remedy i trow for sore disease
within these walls stifled by damp and stench
doth hope's fair torch expire and at the snuff

the desperate revelries fell despair

the prison act i scene iii
traversing the streets without having in view any particular object
other than the observance real life in london such as might occur
from fortuitous incident our two perambulators skirted the metropolis
one fine morning till finding themselves in the vicinity 
tothillfields bridewell a place confinement to which the
magistrates westminster provisionally commit those who are supposed
to be guilty crimes ingress was without much difficulty obtained
and the two friends proceeded to a survey human nature in its most
degraded state where amidst the consciousness infamy and the
miseries privation apathy seemed the predominant feeling with these
outcasts society and reflection on the past or anticipation the
future was absorbed in the vacuum insensibility reckless his
destiny here the manacled felon wore with his gyves the semblance
 the most perfect indifference and the seriousness useful
retrospection was lost in the levity frivolous amusement apart from
the other prisoners was seated a recluse whose appearance excited the
attention the two visitants a deep cloud dejection overshadowed
his features and he seemed studiously to keep aloof from the
obstreperous revelry his fellowcaptives there was in his manner
a something inducing a feeling commiseration which could not be
extended to his callous companions in adversity his decayed
habiliment indicated from its formation and texture that he had seen
better days and his voluntary seclusion confirmed the idea that he
had not been accustomed to his present humiliating intercourse his
intenseness thought precluded the knowledge approximation on his
privacy until our two friends stood before him he immediately rose
made his obeisance and was about to retire when mr dashall with
his characteristic benevolence begged the favour a few moments
conversation
i am gratified he observed in perceiving one exception to the
general turpitude feeling which seems to pervade this place and
i trust that your case distress is not a nature to preclude
the influence hope in sustaining your mind against the pressure 
despondency
the cause my confinement answered the prisoner is originally
that debt although perverted into crime by an unprincipled
relentless creditor destined to the misery losing a beloved wife
and child and subsequently assailed by the minor calamity pecuniary
embarrassment i inevitably contracted a few weeks arrears rent to
the rigid occupant the house wherein i held my humble apartment
when returned one night to my cheerless domicil my irascible landlord
in the plenitude ignorance and malevolence gave me in charge a
sapient guardian the night who without any enquiry into the nature
 my offence conducted me to the watchhouse where i was presently
confronted with my creditor who accused me the heinous crime 
getting into his debt the constable very properly refused to take
cognizance a charge so ridiculous but unluckily observing that had
i been brought there on complaint an assault he would in that case
have felt warranted in my detention my persecutor seized on the idea
with avidity and made a declaration to that effect although evidently
no such thought had in the first instance occurred to him well knowing
the accusation to be grossly unfounded this happened on a saturday
night and i remained in dress and without sustenance until the
following monday when i was held before a magistrate the alleged
assault was positively sworn to and maugre my statement the
suspicious inconsistent conduct my prosecutor i was immured in the
lockup house for the remainder the day on the affidavit 
perjury and in the evening placed under the friendly care the
governor tothillfields bridewell to abide the issue at the next
westminster sessions
this is a most extraordinary affair said the squire and what do you
conjecture may be the result
the pertinacity my respectable prosecutor said the captive might
probably induce him to procure the aid some his conscientious
israelitish brethren whom never saw towards substantiating the
aforesaid assault by manfully swearing to the fact but as i have no
desire exhibiting myself through the streets linked to a chain 
felons on our way to the sessions house i believe i shall contrive
to pay the debt due to the perjured scoundrel which will ensure my
enlargement and let the devil in due season take his own
may we enquire said dashall without the imputation impertinent
inquisitiveness what has been the nature your pursuits in life
multitudinous replied the other my life has been so replete
with adventure and adversity in all its varieties and in its future
prospects so unpropitious happiness that existence has long ceased
to be desirable and had i not possessed a more than common portion 
philosophic resignation i must have yielded to despair but
when all the blandishments life are gone the coward sneaks to
death the brave live on
thirty years ago i came to london buoyant youth and hope to
realize a competency although i knew not by what means the grand
object was to be attained yet it occurred to me that i might be equally
successful with others my country who unaided by recommendation and
united with the means speculation had accumulated fortunes in
this fruitful metropolis and whom fifteen years ago one eminently
fortunate adventurer from the north filled the civic chair with
commensurate political zeal and ability
some are born great others achieve greatness and some have greatness
thrust upon them
well sir what can be said it i was without the pale fortune
although several my schoolmates who had established themselves
in london acquired by dint perseverance parsimony and servility
affluent circumstances convinced however that i was not
destined to acquire wealth and honour and being unsolved even with
the necessaries life i abandoned in london all hope success and
emigrated to ireland where i held for several years the situation 
clerk to a respectable justice the quorum in this situation i lived
well and the perquisites office which were regularly productive on
the return every fair and market day for taking examinations the
peace and filling up warrants apprehension against the perpetrators
 broken heads and bloody noses consoled me in my voluntary exile
from real life in london i was in all respects regarded as one the
family had a horse at my command visited in friendly intimacy the
neighbouring gentry and above all enjoyed the eccentricities the
lower irish most particularly so when before his honour detailing to
his great annoyance a story an hour long about a tester sixpence
and if he grew impatient attributing it to some secret prejudice which
he entertained against them
 their method is to get a story completely by heart and to
tell it as they call it out the face that is from the
beginning to the without interruption
well my good friend i have seen you lounging about these
three hours in the yard what is your business
phase your honour it is what i want to speak one word to
your honour
speak then but be quick what is the matter
the matter plase your honour is nothing at all at all
only just about the grazing a horse phase your honour
that this man here sold me at the fair gurtishannon last
shrove fair which lay down three times with myself phase
your honour and kilt me not to be telling your honour 
how no later back than yesterday night he lay down in the
house there within and all the children standing round and
it was god's mercy he did not fall atop them or into
the fire to burn himself so phase your honour today i
took him back to this man which owned him and after a
great deal to do i got the mare again i swopped exchanged
him for but he won't pay the grazing the horse for the
time i had him though he promised to pay the grazing incase
the horse didn't answer and he never did a day's work
good or bad phase your honour all the time he was with me
and i had the doctor to him five times any how and so
phase your honour it is what i expect your honour will
stand my friend for i'd sooner come to your honour for
justice than to any other in all ireland and so i brought
him here before your honour and expect your honour will
make him pay me the grazing or tell me can i process him
for it at the next assizes phase your honour
the defendant now turning a quid tobacco with his
tongue into some secret cavern in his mouth begins his
defence with
phase your honour under favour and saving your honour's
presence there's not a word truth in all this man has
been saying from beginning to upon my conscience and i
would not for the value the horse itself grazing and
all be after telling your honour a lie for phase your
honour i have a dependance upon your honour that you'll dome
justice and not be listening to him or the like him
phase your honour it is what he has brought me before your
honour because he had a spite against me about some oats i
sold your honour which he was jealous and a shawl his
wife got at my sister's shop there without and never paid
for so i offered to set the shawl against the grazing and
give him a receipt in full all demands but he wouldn't
out spite phase your honour so he brought me before
your honour expecting your honour was mad with me for
cutting down the tree in the horse park which was none 
my doing phase your honour ill luck to them that went
and belied me to your honour behind my back so if your
honour is pleasing i'll tell you the whole truth about the
horse that he swopped against my mare out the face
last shrove fair i met this man jemmy duffy phase your
honour just at the corner the road where the bridge is
broke down that your honour is to have the present for this
year long life to you for it and he was at that time
coming from the fair gurtishannon and the same way
how are you jemmy says i very well i thank you
bryan says he shall we turn back to paddy salmon's and
take a naggin whiskey to our better acquaintance i
don't care if i did jemmy says i only it is what i
can't take the whiskey because i'm under an oath against it
for a month ever since phase your honour the day your
honour met me on the road and observed to me i could hardly
stand i had taken so much though upon my conscience your
honour wronged me greatly that same time ill luck to them
that belied me behind my back to your honour well phase
your honour as i was telling you as he was taking the
whiskey and we talking one thing or t'other he makes mean
offer to swop his mare that he couldn't sell at the fair
 gurtishannou because nobody would be troubled with the
beast phase your honour against my horse and to oblige
him i took the mare sorrow take her and him along with
her she kicked me a new car that was worth three pounds
ten to tatters the first time i ever put her into it and
i expect your honour will make him pay me the price the
car any how before i pay the grazing which i have no
right to pay at all at all only to oblige him but i leave
it all to your honour and the whole grazing he ought to be
charging for the beast is but two and eight pence halfpenny
any how phase your honour so i'll abide by what your
honour says good or bad i'll leave it all to your honour
i'll leave it all to your honour literally means i'll
leave all the trouble to your honour
but this pleasant life was not decreed much longer to endure
the insurrection broke out during which an incident occurred that had
nearly terminated all my then cares in this life past present and to
come
in my capacity as clerk or secretary i had written one morning for
the worthy magistrate two letters both containing remittances the one
l and the other l in bank ireland bills we were situated at
the distance fifteen miles from the nearest market town and as the
times were perilous and my employer unwilling to entrust property to the
precarious conveyance subordinate agency he requested that i would
take a morning ride and with my own hands deliver these letters at
the postoffice accordingly i set out and had arrived to within three
miles my destination when my further progress was opposed by two
men in green uniform who with supported arms and fixed bayonets
were pacing the road to and fro as sentinels in a very steady and
soldierlike manner on the challenge one these fellows with arms
at port demanding the countersign i answered that i had none to give
that i was travelling on lawful business to the next town and required
to know by what authority he stopt me on the king's highway by the
powers he exclaimed this is my authority then and immediately
brought his musket to the charge against the chest my horse i now
learnt that the town had been taken possession that morning by a
division the army the people for so the insurgents had styled
themselves you may turn your nag homewards if you choose said the
sentry but if you persist in going into the town i must pass you by
the different outposts to the officer on duty the business in which
i was engaged not admitting delay i preferred advancing and was
ushered ultimately to the notice the captain the guard who
very kindly informed me that his general would certainly order me to be
hanged as a spy unless i could exhibit good proof the contrary with
this comfortable assurance i was forthwith introduced into the presence
 the rebel general he was a portly goodlooking man apparently about
the age forty not more wore a green uniform with gold embroidery
and was engaged in signing dispatches which his secretary successively
sealed and superscribed his staff were in attendance and a
provostmarshal in waiting to perform the office summary execution on
those to whom the general might attach suspicion the insurgent leader
now enquiring with much austerity my name profession from
whence i came the object my coming and lastly whether or not i
was previously aware the town being in possession the army the
people i answered these interrogatories by propounding the question
who the gentleman was to whom i had the honour addressing myself
and under what authority i was considered amenable to his inquisition
answer my enquiries sir he replied without the impertinency 
idle circumlocution otherwise i shall consider you as a spy and my
provostmarshal shall instantly perform on your person the duties 
his office i now resorted to my letters i had no other alternative
between existence and annihilation explaining therefore who i
was and by whom employed these letters i added are each in my
handwriting and both contain remittances i came to this town for the
sole purpose putting them into the postoffice and i was not aware
until informed by your scouts that the place was in the occupation 
an enemy he deigned not a reply farther than pointing to one 
the letters and demanding to know the amount the bill which it
enveloped i answered one hundred and fifty pounds he immediately
broke the seal examined the bill and found that it was correct now
sir he continued sit down and write from my dictation he dictated
from the letter which he had opened and when i had finished the
copy compared it next with the original characters expressed his
satisfaction at their identity and returning the letters licensed my
departure when and to where i list observing that i was fortunate in
having had with me those testimonials business otherwise said he
your appearance under circumstances suspicion might have led to a
fatal result you may be assured gentlemen continued the narrator
that i did not prolong my stay in the town beyond the shortest
requisite period two mounted dragoons by order their general
escorted me past the outposts and i reached home in safety these
occurrences took place on a saturday the triumph the insurgent
troops was short duration they were attacked that same night by the
king's forces discomfited and their daring chieftain taken prisoner
on the monday following his head stuck upon a pike surmounted the
markethouse belfast the scenes anarchy and desperation in which
that unfortunate country became now involved rendered it no very
desirable residence i therefore procured a passport bid adieu to the
emerald isle erin ma vorneen shan leet go brag and once more returned
to london to experience a renewal that misfortune by which i have
with little interval been hitherto accompanied during the whole period
 my eventful life
the two strangers had listened to the narrative with mingled sensations
 compassion and surprise the one feeling excited by the peculiarity
the other by the pertinacity his misfortunes when their cogitations
were interrupted by a dissonant clamour amongst the prisoners who it
appeared had united in enmity against an unlucky individual whom they
were dragging towards the discipline the pump with all the eagerness
 inflexible vengeance
on enquiry into the origin this uproar it was ascertained that one
 the prisoners under a charge slight assault had been visited by
this fellow who affecting to commiserate his situation proposed to
arrange matters with his prosecutor for his immediate release with
other offers gratuitous assistance this pretended friend was
recognised by one the prisoners as a kidnapper
a kidnapper or crimp is one those fellows abandoned principles
who enter into the pay the east india company in order to recruit
their army and when a guinea or two is advertised to be given to any
person that brings a proper man five feet eight or nine inches high
lie in wait to entrap men for the money some these gentry assume
the character officers others serjeants drummers and recruits
without the least shadow commission among them they have many
ways inveigling the artless and unthinking one or two these
kidnappers dressed as countrymen go five or six miles out town to
meet the waggons and stages and enquire if john suchaone is come up
which is answered in the negative no such person being known they
then enter into discourse with the countrymen and being perfectly
complaisant engage attention and by the time they get to london learn
their occupations and business to town whether they are in search 
places trades or intend to return home again which intelligence
they in general profit by coming to the place rendezvous the 
kidnappers propose a pint porter which being agreed on they enter
the house where their companions are in waiting enjoy themselves overflowing
bowls and exhilarating their spirits with loyal toasts and
songs begin their business by enquiring who is willing to serve his
majesty the countryman if inclined thereto is generally deceived if
his desire is for the guards or any other particular regiment there
are at hand mock serjeants and privates who will swear they belong to
the corps and the dupe is trepanned for the east indies hurried onboard
a ship or kept in some dismal place security till a sufficient
number is collected and an opportunity serves to send them away
on the other hand should the countryman be averse to enlisting and
talk going away these crimps will swear that he has received a
shilling or more the bountymoney insisting that they saw him put
the money into such and such a pocket it is in vain that the countryman
denies having received it search is made money found and he is
compelled to submit or pay the smart
others again these prowlers frequent the places confinement and
learning the particular case some prisoner for small debt or slight
assault kindly otter to mediate with the prosecutor or creditor
in effecting liberation the pretended friend assumes the most
disinterested feeling sympathy ingratiates himself into confidence
and generally terminates his machinations with success accomplishes the
prisoner's release and sends him ultimately from temporary dress to
perpetual exile
such was the character the fellow now placed in the ominous guidance
 an exasperated multitude they urged him forward to the place 
punishment but the tumultuary assemblage were disappointed in their
anticipated vengeance by the interposition the turnkeys and the
pretended friend escaped the meditated castigation
observe again said the narrator that dashing young fellow arrayed
in the first style dandyism
my good fellow interrupted bob he is not i should think one 
the community he has apparently the manners the well bred and
accomplished gentleman and for that very reason sir is the better
qualified to carry on his profession with impunity he whom you
dignify with the appellation a well bred and accomplished gentleman
is all that you have expressed him with the exception one word
that is substitute for gentleman swindler and the character is justly
delineated this fellow desperate enterprize is one the numerous
practitioners knavery who set themselves up for men property
and integrity the more easily to defraud the unwary and ignorant out 
their substance and effects this spark connecting himself with several
others similar pursuit they took a genteel house in a respectable
part the town and dividing themselves into classes masters
clerks outriders shorten porters and servants and thus making
a show opulence they easily obtained credit and laid in goods 
every kind which they sent into the country and sold or bartered for
other commodities these commodities they brought up to london and sold
for ready money generally taking in exchange double the quantity and
paying for the same with notes their own drawing indorsing and
fabricating for the purpose cheating the poor deluded farmer
shopkeeper and tradesman in the interior the country with respect
to tradesmen in town the goods they took them on trust they disposed
 to jews and other receivers stolen goods at about thirty percent
under value for ready money nay forty per cent rather than not
have the cash and as their stay in one place could not safely exceed
five months on account their creditors calling in their debts
and their country notes becoming due they used to make all possible
dispatch to dispose the various articles and evacuate the premises
before detection this done they played the same game elsewhere when
proteus like they changed shapes and disguised themselves so as
not to be known and carried on business in another house but in a
different name the master became the rider the rider the master the
clerks descended to footmen and porters the footmen to porters and
clerks and so on throughout until they had drained many parts the
town and country to the ruin several worthy and honest families
however the copartnership is now dissolved the establishment is broke
up and the different individuals this nefarious gang depredators
 whom the well bred and accomplished gentleman the subject our
remarks is one the principals are consigned to different
gaols for further examination and final commitment
dashall expressed thanks for the interesting communication and the
squire his astonishment that the credulity man could warrant the hope
 success to such a combination however systematically arranged and
where so many were concerned and the distribution plunder perhaps by
no means equalized that some dissatisfied individual did not renounce
the dangerous connection in the hope impunity and reward
we know not that there is any subordinate division spoil said the
other but if such there be it may in this union interests be the
maxim as with other copartnership concerns that he by whatsoever
means who contributes the most to the general stock shall participate
the most in the general benefit
swindlers have other means cheating and tricking the public such
as answering the advertisements tradesmen who are in want a sum to
make good a payment and offering in consideration a small premium
to get them the money required on their note hand which they
premise must be first given and the money will be immediately advanced
the necessitated person agrees to the terms and unthinkingly gives
his note which one the swindlers carries away with a promise a
speedy return with the money wanted but neither swindler nor note
is forthcoming until it becomes due after having passed through
many different hands some whom can ascertain giving a valuable
consideration for the same and fix the drawer to the payment whose
consolation for his credulity is paying the money or going to prison
in case a stagnation trade the swindlers advertise themselves to
borrow or lend upon good security if they borrow they have sham deeds
and make false conveyance estates in nubibus nobody knows where
if they lend they artfully inveigle the borrower out his security
which they take up money upon and convert to their own use without
the deluded person's knowledge and by absconding leave him to the
mortification descanting on their roguery and his own want 
foresight
 the triumvirate were once more interrupted a newcomer had
arrived and the prisoners hailed his initiation with the first stanza
 an old song
welcome welcome brother debtor
to this poor but merry place
where no bailiff dun nor setter
dares to shew his frightful face
but kind sir as you're a stranger
down your garnish you must lay
else your coat will be in danger
you must either strip or pay
 setters this appellation is applicable to others than
thosealluded to in the above stanza as connected with duns
and bailiffs they are a dangerous set wretches who are
capable committing any villany as well by trepanning a
rich heir into matrimony with a castoff mistress or common
prostitute as by coupling a young heiress with a notorious
sharper down to the lowest scene setting debtors for the
bailiff and his followers smitten with the first glance 
the lady you resign your heart the conjugal knot is tied
and like the copper captain you find the promised land
houses and furniture the property another and not 
yourself
the novitiate neither surprised at his reception nor adverse to the
custom the place seemed quite at home paid his garnish without
hesitation and entered at once into the vacuum indifference with his
new associates
the attention dashall and tallyhoho was attracted by the clank 
fetters as one the prisoners squatted himself on the pavement 
the yard leaning his back against the wall he commenced darning an old
stocking chanting at same time an old song from the beggar's opera
as if predicting his own fate yet with a manner indicating the most
callous indifference
since laws were made for every degree
to curb vice in others as well as in me
i wonder we hasn't better company
upon tyburn tree
but gold from law can take out the sting
and if rich men like us were to swing
twould thin the land such numbers would string
upon tyburn tree
the irreclaimable depravity this man could not excite any urgent
feeling sympathy in his behalf and our two friends took no further
notice him
 their intelligencer who in the meanwhile had gone forth for
information now advancing i thought said he that i had seen
elsewhere this johnny newcome he is a sharper another precious
addition to our respectable community
respectable indeed exclaimed tallyhoho as he detected an urchin thief
in the act picking his pocket his handkerchief this hopeful imp
though young in years was experienced in iniquity had served an active
apprenticeship to the art picking pockets with impunity
 the sharper who has generally had a genteel education is
a person good address and conversation has more the
power delusion at will than the unlettered cheat devoid
 address and other requisites to complete the pretended
gentleman and therefore should be more carefully avoided
these villains having run through their fortunes at an
early period life by associating with professed gamblers
and sharpers who having eased them their money in
return complete them for the profession by which they have
been ruined set up for themselves throw aside honour and
conscience and quote the lex talionis for deceiving others
as they themselves have been deceived these gentry are to
be met with at horseraces cockfights the billiard and
hazard tables and at all public places diversion on
your entering the coffeehouse tavern or gaminghouse the
sharper views you with attention and is not long before he
becomes acquainted and very intimate with you if you agree
to his proposal to play if he cannot beat you by fair he
will by foul means rather than lose he will elude your
attention and raise your passion sufficiently to put you
off your guard while he plays his underhand game and
cheats you before your face and though you are sensible 
being cheated yet you shall not be able to discover by what
means it is effected the various methods sharpers have to
cheat and deceive are so many and unaccountable that it
would exceed the limits our publication to detail even
the tenthpart them their study is to supply their
exigencies by means within their power however wicked or
villanous if you associate with sharpers you must not only
expect but deserve to be cheated by them for your
credulity for who would go with his eyes open into a den 
thieves but in expectation being robbed or who would
herd with sharpers and not expect to be cheated we would
therefore advise the stranger in london to shun these
reptiles the creation fraught with guile and artful as
the serpent to delude beware their conversation avoid
their company take no notice their tricks nor be caught
by their wheedling professions friendship listen not to
any their enticements if you would preserve your peace
and property be not fond making new acquaintance with
persons you do not know however genteel in appearance and
behaviour for many a villain lurks under the disguise a
modern fine gentleman and if any stranger asks you to play
with him for money set him down in your mind as a sharper
and leave the room immediately
and at last became so great an adept in the profession that at
the early age thirteen years he was unanimously elected captain 
an organized band juvenile depredators some much younger none older
than himself who for a considerable length time set at defiance the
vigilance the police these young fry carried on a long protracted
successful war extermination against ladies reticule one urchin
watching her approach would lay himself across the path she must pass
and it frequently happened that she tumbled over him a grab was then
made at the reticule the watch and the shawl with which the young
villains generally got clear off others in detachments two or
three would hover about the door or window a tradesman's shop cut
out a pane glass and abstract some valuable trinket or watch the
retirement the shopkeeper into his backroom when one the most
enterprizing would enter on hands and knees crawl round the counter
with the stillness death draw out the till with its contents and
bear off the spoil with impunity one night however luckily for the
public the whole gang was made prisoners and dispersed to various
gaols each delinquent being ordered a severe flogging and solitary
confinement availing himself this indulgence the captain had
watched the opportunity approximating towards tallyhoho and was
detected as we said before in the exercise his former propensities
so difficult it is to eradicate vice from the human mind even though
in this instance so early implanted lenity in this case would have been
equally misplaced as unjust although the squire humanely pressed his
intercession the incorrigible pilferer was therefore handed over to
the custody one the turnkeys until the governor might award a
punishment suitable to the heinousness the offence
the two friends had been here above an hour it was an hour they thought
not idly spent and now leaving a small donation for distribution
amongst such as appeared deserving objects they returned home gratified
by the additional knowledge acquired real life in london 
chapter iii
would you see
the debtors world confide yourself to me
come safely shall you pass the fatal door
nor fear it shuts you in to ope no more
see frowning grimly o'er the borough road
the crossing spikes that crown the dark abode
o how that iron seems to pierce the soul
 him whom hurrying wheels to prison roll
what time from serjeants inn some debtor pale
the tipstaff renders in default bail
black shows that grisly ridge against the sky
as near he draws and lifts an anxious eye
then on his bosom each peculiar spike
arm'd with its proper ill appears to strike
the recollection past enjoyments in the vivacious company merry
well could not fail to be revived in the minds dashall and his
cousin and as some persons with due attention to his safety had
manifested their interest and regard for him by obtaining his admission
to the priory where he was at this moment pursuing his studies
and could not quite so conveniently call on them an early visit was
determined on
we shall said tom by a call on merrywell after six weeks residence
among the gay blades that inhabit the walls the king's bench

delineate the characters consciences and conduct his neighbours
he will describe all the comforts and advantages a college life
introduce us to the bloods and the blacks and in short there are few
persons i know except sparkle himself more able to conduct us through
the intricacies the building to point out the beauty and excellence
 the establishment its uses and abuses than merrywell
do they charge any thing on admittanceenquired bob
o yes was the reply they charge you by a public notice in
the lobby not to convey into the interior any spirituous liquors on
pain being yourself discharged from thence and confined elsewhere
bless your soul why the king's bench is a little world within itself
a sort epitome london it is in a healthy situation and the space
which it occupies is extensive there are in all rooms and they
measure each about or feet by or these eight are called
staterooms are much larger than the rest and more commodious and
a wellbreeches customer may have almost any accommodation it is the
prison most immediately belonging to the court king's bench and
exclusive debtors there sued all persons standing in contempt
 that court and most those committed under its sentence are
confined
and pretty generally all inhabited interrogated tallyhoho
yes and frequently it is difficult to obtain a place to sleep in even
as a chum
bob found himself at fault and required an explanation the word
chum
the chum replied dashall is a partner or bedfellow a person
who has an equal right to all the comforts and conveniences a room
previously wholly in the possession one
i understand said bob then when every room has already one
occupant they accommodate him with a companion
exactly so and he may prove friend or foe this however may be
avoided if the student is in possession the rubbish by an escape
into the rules which extend for three miles round the priory these
rules are purchaseable after the following rate viz ten guineas for
the first hundred pounds and about half that sum for every hundred
pounds afterwards dayrules which three may be obtained in every
term may be purchased for s d for the first day and s d for
the rest each also must give good security to the marshal
the fiction the law supposes
that every prisoner with means to pay
for he that has not this advantage loses
either has business in the courts or may
bond fee and sureties fresh prepare the way
and mister broothoft's manual sign declares
that mister suchaone on such a day
hath got a rule court and so repairs
to town or elsewhere call'd by his affairs
this little talisman strange effect
four shillings just and sixpence is the price
from bailiff's power the wearer will protect
and nullify a capias in a trice
it bears a royal head in quaint device
at least as true as that which wellesley pole
with taste for english artists much too nice
stamp'd by pistrucci's aid heaven rest his soul
and shield henceforth the mint from his controul
in various ways the various purchasers
that sally forth with this protecting spell
employ the privilege this grant confers
some like myself their lawyer's citadel
besiege his speed long striving to impel
to take a dinner with a friend some go
in fashion's haunts some for an hour to swell
some strive what creditors intend to know
and some the moments on their love bestow
thus you have a full true and particular as well as amusing account
 a day rule or what in the cant language the day is termed hiring
a horse which sometimes proves a bolter
and what is meant by a bolter
he is one replied dashall who having obtained the privilege a
day rule brushes off and leaves his bondsmen or the marshal to
pay his debt or one who transgresses the bounds but such a one when
retaken usually undergoes some discipline from the inhabitants the
college who being all honourable men set their faces against such
ungentlemanlike proceedings
then they do sometimes make an escape
yes notwithstanding their restrictive arrangements such things have
occurred and you must recollect that lord cochrane confined for
the memorable stock exchange hoax the means by which it was effected
i believe have never been discovered but certain it is that he was in
the house commons while a prisoner in the king's bench and on the
first night his subsequent liberation gave the casting vote against
a proposed grant to a certain duke
i remember it very well and also remember that the generality 
thinking persons considered his lordship harshly treated
 however he is now bravely fighting the battles independence
increasing both his fame and fortune while some the ministerial
hirelings are subjected to a similar privation we shall have a view 
some the residents in this renowned place fashionable resort the
interior which perhaps exhibits a spectacle far more diversified
and if possible more immoral and vicious than the exterior there are
quondam gentlemen fortune reduced either so low as not to be able to
pay for the rules or so unprincipled and degraded as to have no friend
at command who could with safety become their surety shopkeepers
whose knavery having distanced even their extravagance dread the
appearance ease exhibited in the rules and the detection fraud
by producing the reverse their independence and who even grudge
the expenditure money to obtain limited liberty
certificates bankrupts and unconnected felons jews gamblers by
trade horsedealers money scriveners bill discounters annuity
procurers disinterested profligates unemployed and branded
attorneys scandal mongers and libel writers gazetted publicans
and the perhaps less culpable sinners broken officers reduced
mechanics starving authors and castoff cyprians
a very comprehensive and animated account truly said tallyhoho
and you will find it accurate continued dashall for the turnout 
this dwelling crime and misery resembles the piazza de sant marco at
venice in the carnival time there are all descriptions and classes in
society all casts and sects all tribes and associations all colours
complexions and appearances not only human and inhuman beings but
also all shades features and conformations vice the spendthrift
or degraded man fortune lives by shifts by schemes by loans by
sponging on the novice by subscription or on commiseration's uncertain
aid he has however in perspective some visionary scheme emolument
and dishonour blended to put into execution as soon as he obtains his
discharge the certificates bankrupt has many opportunities left yet
he has other dupes other tricks trade other resources in reserve
the swindler mellows refines and sublimates his plan future
operations and associates in it perchance a fallen fair one oran
incipient greek put up in the bench horsedealers money
scriveners bill doers attorneys c have either the means setting
up again or some new system roguery to be put in practice in fresh
time and place which may conduct them to the harbour fortune or
waft them over the herring pond at the expence the public purse the
disinterested profligate here either consumes corrupts and festers
under the brandy fever and despair or is put up by a gambler who sells
his art to his brother debtors and thus lives in hope yet turning
the honest penny in imitation those who have gone before him the
cyprian still exercising her allurements lingers and decays
until persecution loses the point its arrow and drops from the
persecutor's hand grasping more hardly after money and opening from
the clenched attitude revenge then to conclude the picture there
are youths living upon the open infamy easyhearted women who
disgrace and ruin themselves without the walls in order to pamper the
appetite and humour the whims a favourite within thus sacrificing
one victim to another partners carrying on trade in the world
communing with their incarcerated partners in durance vile misery and
extravagance rude joy and frantic fear with more passions than the
celebrated collins ever drew and with more scenes adventures and
vicissitudes than ever jonathan wild or any other jonathan exhibited
excellent description exclaimed bob
and you shall have ocular demonstration its absolute existence nay
this sketch might serve for many other places confinement the fleet
c they are like the streets the metropolis constantly varying in
their company according to entrances and exits their visitors
this however continued the hon tom dashall is rather a mental
picture what we shall presently witness in reality a sort 
introductory sketch by way passport through the doors this
panorama real life to which you will shortly be introduced a sort
 ideal or dramatic sketch its inhabitants en masse before the
drawing up the curtain
the eagerness bob to listen to his cousin's sketches london
society on the one hand and the earnestness with which dashall
had been exercising his imaginary powers on the other had led our
perambulators to the foot blackfriar's bridge on their road
to the king's bench without any particular circumstance exciting their
attention when bob suddenly twitching his cousin by the arm and
directing his eye at the same time to a thin spare figure a man
without hat or coat who was rapidly passing towards fleet market
enquired who it was and what was his occupation or calling
don't you hear his calling was the reply
hot hot hot pudding hot was in a moment vociferated in his ears
while the active and industrious mercantile pedestrian with a swing 
his head which was in continual motion from right to left gave bob a
wipe in the eye with his tail which by the velocity the wearer was
kept in full play like the pendulum a clock or the tail matthews
in his admirable delineation sir fretful plagiary
zounds cries bob it is true i may hear but i can't pretend to say
i can see who the devil is he there is no looking at him he seems to
leave time and space behind him where is he
tom laughed heartily while bob rubbed his eyes in vain to obtain
another view
that said dashall is a sort commissary a dealer in stores for
the stomach red hot pudding all hot and commonly called the flying
pieman
 james sharpe eglaud more commonly known in the streets 
the metropolis by the appellation the flying pitman may
fairly be held forth as an example what may be effected
by persevering industry and activity especially in a large
and populous city those qualities joined with a moderate
share prudence cannot fail to ensure to every man at
least comfort and respectability it not competence and
wealth however humble his sphere and however unpromising
his beginnings he was bred to the sedentary trade a
tailor and worked for some years with his relation mr
canterbury friday street cheapside but love which
works so many changes and which has ere now transformed
blacksmiths into painters and which induced hercules to
exchange his club for the distaff caused this knight the
steel bar to relinquish the shopboard and patch up his
fortune by the pattypan he married his landlady a widow
who resided in turnmill street clerkenwell he had a soul
above buttons and abandoned the making garments to cover
the outside in order to mould cakes pies and other small
pastry to comfort the internals his active genius
however could not brook the tedious task serving his
customers behind the counter he therefore took up his
eatables and went abroad in quest them and we doubt not
he has found this practice which he has continued ever
since very profitable the neatness and cleanliness his
appearance at all times are truly pleasing hail rain or
shine he may be seen abroad without coat or hat his hair
powdered his shirt sleeves turned up to his elbows and a
steel hanging on his apronstring originally he carried a
tin case something like a dutch oven in which he
constantly kept a lire but is now generally seen with a
small tray in serving a customer he never touches his
pudding with his hands but has a knife for the purpose 
presenting it to the purchasers and his sale is so
extensive that he is obliged to replenish several times ina
day and in order to secure a regular and ready supply
his female partner and himself convey a quantity pudding
to a certain distance and deposit their load at some
publichouse where she takes care to keep it all hot
while egland scours the neighbourhood in search 
customers the first cargo being disposed he returns for
more and by this method he has it always fresh and is
never in want goods
many laughable anecdotes are told this flying pitman and
perhaps a day's excursion in following him during his
peregrinations would furnish much curious and interesting
amusement we shall however select one authenticated by his
appearance at marlborough street police office on monday
july as most intimately connected with real life in
london when he preferred a serious charge against a beggar
no other than the president a smoking club in the holy
land and others for stealing his mutton pies cutting off
his tail and otherwise disfiguring his person by the
evidence egland it appeared that he was introduced with
his goods for sale to a company chiefly consisting 
street beggars in st giles's the chair at that moment
being filled by a beggar without hands well known in the
vicinity the admiralty as a chalked the pavement the
dignity the chair was well sustained by this ingenious
coloured who was smoking a pipe as great as an alderman
over a bason turtle soup but no sooner did egland make
his appearance than the company seized upon his goods and
crammed them down their throats in spite the repeated
vociferations honour honour gentlemen from the
assailed resistance was vain and egland in this dilemma
began to consider that his only safety lay in flight this
however he found equally impracticable he was detained
and by way consolation for his loss was called upon fora
song his lungs were good and although his spirits were
not much exhilarated by the introductory part the
entertainment he began to tip em a stave but whilst he
was chanting the stormy winds do blow a fellow cut off
his tail this was worse than all the rest it was as it
were a part his working tools and the loss it was
likely to injure his business by an alteration his
appearance and could not be tacitly submitted to
the magistrates gravely considering this a most serious
charge unprovoked attack upon an industrious individual
ordered the parties to find bail in default fully
satisfying the inoffensive dealer in pastry which was
accordingly done
in the year scorning to be behindhand in loyalty as
well as activity he became a member the clerkenwell
volunteers and was placed in the light company in which
capacity he obtained the character not only being the
cleanest man but the best soldier in the regiment
it is said that for amusement or the gratification a
whim he will sometimes walk a distance fifty or a
hundred miles from the metropolis and return the same way
on such occasions he always manages to take some companion
or friend out with him but was never known to come back in
the same company for so irresistibly are they allured
forward by his inexhaustible fund humour and
sprightliness conversation that they seldom think the
distance till they find themselves too far from home to
return on foot
then said bob he is not like some the london dealers who
invite their customers to taste and try before they buy for he scarcely
seems to afford a chance seeing what he sells
you did not try him replied tom nor would he have expected you to
be a customer he is a remarkable character well known all over the
metropolis particularly noted for his activity in disposing 
his goods never standing still for a moment but accosting with
extraordinary ease and fluency every person who appears likely to be a
purchaser always ready with an answer to any question but delivering
it with so much volubility that it is impossible to propose a second
enquiry suiting at the same time his answer to the apparent quality
 the querist though frequently leaving it unfinished in search a
customer and moving on with so much rapidity that you may almost find
him at the same moment at tower hill billingsgate and spa fields at
smithfield temple bar and piccadilly indeed he may be said to be in
all quarters the town in a space time incredibly short for a man
who obtains a livelihood by seeking customers as he moves along
zounds cried bob this walking genius this credible incredible
and visible invisible pedestrian dealer in portable eatables has almost
blinded me
for by this flying pitman
i've nearly lost an eye man
come said tom i've no fear your eye while you can muster a
couplet so let us proceed
crossing black friars bridge and approaching the road bob who had
assuaged the pain which he had previously been complaining
could not help admiring the extensive range houses on each side 
the way terminated by a handsome building in the distance
that building said dashall will be the extent our journey for
very near to it is the habitation merrywell where i entertain no
doubt you will find enough for observation a useful as well asa
humorous nature for an epitome men and manners is there to be
obtained
here are abundance subjects worthy inspection in this quarter
replied tom and we therefore ought not to exhaust too much time on
one so let us proceed do you see that high wall to the right that is
the magdalen hospitality established for the relief and
 the magdalen hospital in blacksmiths road enclosed from
public view occupies an extensive space ground and is
from the nature its inhabitants very properly so
enclosed it was opened in the year and it must be a
delightful reflection to its governors that during the
period it has subsisted more than twothirds the women
who have been admitted have been reconciled to their
friends or placed in honest employments or reputable
services besides which a very considerable portion have
since been married and are at this moment respectable
members society circumstances which prove the great and
important utility this admirable institution
there is no prescribed time for the objects this charity
to remain in the house it being varied according to
circumstances every effort is made use to find out their
relations and friends if possible to bring about a
reconciliation with them and if they prove to be persons 
character to put them under their protection if however
the young women are destitute such friends they are kept
in the house till an opportunity offers placing them in
reputable services or otherwise procuring them the means 
obtaining an honest livelihood and they never discharge anyone
without providing for her there have been but few
discharged beyond the age twenty years
the general business the establishment is conducted by a
committee consisting governors who meet at the
hospital every thursday at twelve o'clock precisely except
on the first thursday every mouth when they meet at
eleven two them attend at the chapel in rotation every
sunday at morning and evening service when a collection is
made at the door on entrance the hours divine service
are a quarter after eleven in the forenoon and a quarter
after six in the evening and on account the fascination
 the singing no place worship in the metropolis is
more worthy the notice strangers
an opportunity is afforded to companies who wish to visit
this charity by addressing a request by letter to the
committee any thursday or to a bonnet esq the treasurer
any day in the week and no fees are allowed to be taken
reformation wretched outcasts from society the principle on which
it is founded entitles it to the countenance and support the public
and particularly the female sex the object being to reclaim and
restore to virtue such wanderers in the labyrinths vice as are not
totally depraved
admirable intentions indeed cried tallyhoho if they are but as well
carried into effect
the records the establishment have proved its advantages to society
or rather i should say to its conductors for they are a nature
which cannot be publicly exposed without much private injury to
the individuals who partake them it is however not a little
remarkable that till lately on the very opposite side the road the
neighbourhood has exhibited scenes vice immorality and indecency
which it is the great object this charity if possible to prevent by
an endeavour to reclaim the miserable and deluded wretches from their
evil ways i remember the late john home tooke related in the house 
commons a curious anecdote in allusion to himself and his situation
at the time in which this institution was mentioned and which excited
considerable interest
it is well known that the late john home tooke political memory as
the reputed tutor a certain patriotic baronet the present day as
well as the author the diversions parley and a correspondent
 the yet undiscovered junius was a reverend divine the church
 england and when he became a member parliament it was objected
against him that no person in holy orders could hold a seat in the
honourable house commons in his reply he very ingeniously observed
that this objection reminded him an applicant for admission to the
magdalen who upon being exhorted by the chaplain to forsake her
evil ways replied that she was not aware his meaning and upon
explanation she was excluded from the charity because she was not bad
enough to require reforming this said mr home tooke is exactly
my case because i am in holy orders i must leave the house and
after committing some act impropriety to lose my gown i may yet be
eligible for a member this assembly
pointed enough said bob tallyhoho
yes replied tom and having mentioned the name the man you may
perhaps recollect the order the day as well as the curious
definition before the commissioners the income tax as to how a man
lives who has no income at all being interrogated by the commissioners
as to how he obtained his living mr home tooke replied as
follows why it appears to me gentlemen that there are three modes
by which a person may obtain a living the first is by begging now
this i am too proud to submit to the second by stealing this i don't
choose to resort to and the third is by the exercise the wits and
this gentlemen i presume you know nothing about
here said dashall is the surrey theatre formerly denominated the
royal circus i shall however dispatch my description it in a very
few words as we will ere long pay a visit to its interior it is a
neat building and shews a good front to the road is fitted up with a
considerable degree elegance and is a very convenient theatre it
was originally conducted by hughes and jones and its exhibitions were
both scenic and equestrian something in the style what ashley's
amphitheatre is now but you must see the one in order to form an idea
 the other horses are now banished at this place where under
an annual license from the magistrates the county burlettas
melodramas dancing and pantomimes are got up and performed in a style
which would not disgrace even the patent theatres it is at present
under the management mr dibdin a son the celebrated writer 
so many our national patriotic and characteristic ballads just
through the turnpike the building which gives a sort finish to the
road is the school for the indigent blind at the back which is the
philanthropic institution calculated to unite the purposes charity
with those industry and police to rescue from destruction the
offspring the vicious and criminal and bethlehem hospital for the
care and cure insane persons well deserving minute inspection
and to the right at the corner a road which leads from westminster
bridge towards vauxhall is an asylum for female orphans which as the
magdalen was intended to reclaim prostitutes was originally intended to
prevent prostitution to the left again is the king's bench and as
that is our present place destination we will forego any further
description till another opportunity
i cannot however refrain a few remarks on the situation we are
now in for from this place may be seen the children penance the
magdalen the children darkness the school for the indigent blind
the insane new bethlehem the infatuated and fanatic the congregations
 the soar chapel and the faithful menses garrets and wooden
tabernacles the children thespis and terpsichore the surrey
theatre mingled together as it were with the debtor and the captive
the king's bench at least placing ourselves at this obelisk in the
centre the road the mind's eye can comprehend them within a short
distance each other
and a curious admixture the useful and the sweet it certainly is
exclaimed tallyhoho anxious to give his cousin a little respite while
they turned to the left on their way to the bench
you will find continued tom all the beforementioned infirmities
blindness infatuation madness and profligacy within the walls that
we shall shortly enter without the repentant spirit the sisters
within the walls we have just passed you will also find there is
a plenty selfinterest and hypocrisy combined with them nay an
hospital incurables is only wanting to complete the scene it is not
till lately that a little reform has been effected in this quarter for
dover street and its vicinity as i before observed so near to these
benevolent charities and to the walls a prison have been the sink
 female profligacy the lowest most dangerous and most disgusting
kind and suffered too long to pollute the streams charity and impede
the road to reform however at length the nuisance is removed at least
the public appearance it though the neighbourhood is not altogether
bereft its private negociations and stolen accommodations but come
now for an interior view the abbott's park its interesting scenery
and its multivarious characters there you shall see what you shall
see and merrywell will tell you more in ten minutes than you might wish
to know in your whole life i mean practically though it is well to
know in theory what ought never to be reduced to experiment
chapter 
give me leave to ask a question
pray in the king's bench have you ever been
the bench good heaven how shocking a suggestion
was e'er so saucy a companion seen
well you ne'er saw the place or if you did
twere better not too closely to surmise
enough enough those frowns the thought forbid
who sees too much is rarely counted wise
i rather boast that mine are prudent eyes
persons and things so quietly they read
nor by a glance confess they scrutinize
that thoughtless lookers think me blind indeed
when themselves i take the strictest heed
but since you wish me to believe that college
ne'er gave its finish to your education
i its laws and customs having knowledge
ere i take up the thread my narration
must say a little for your information
they had now passed the outer gates the prison and entered a courtyard
surrounded by a wall which enclosed some good looking houses
these houses said dashall are occupied by the principal officers 
the place and devoted to purposes business or let out by them for
the accommodation those who have purchased the privilege the
rules this door directly opposite the gate is the only entrance to the
park
illustration paget king's bench
they next passed up the steps and entered a gloomy apartment whereafter
a few minutes a turnkey surveying their persons rather minutely
opened the ponderous door which admitted them to an inner court 
confined dimensions bob looked around him with surprise after the
description his cousin and began to think he had been vamping up
imaginary pictures what was not to be realized however hearing
a variety voices and perceiving another gate he quelled his
conjectures and followed dashall who upon knocking at the door
was surveyed from a sort loophole by the keeper within who quickly
gave them entrance and the spacious appearance the parade racquet
ground and habitations and a moving panorama personages both
sexes attracted his immediate attention
gazing with enquiring eyes upon this worldwithinwalls they
scarcely heeded the variety salutations with which they were greeted
on entering such as nods winks and touches on the shoulder from one
who appeared as unconscious such familiarity as if he had for sometime
been wholly absorbed in the solution a mathematical problem
or the horselaugh the ignorant and vulgar by whom they found
themselves surrounded struggling through the throng dashall impelled
his cousin forward repeating as he proceeded
how many o'er this threshold pass that mourn
wanting our power at pleasure to return
a moment let us pause ere we ascend
the gallery that leads us to our friend
survey the place where all that meets your view
is full interest and strangely new
could we but hide those grinning spikes awhile
borne spacious barrack we might think the pile
however continued he i perceive we are quizzed we will just take
a turn round and probably we may meet merrywell if not we will soon
find him out by enquiry you perceive they have the accommodation 
a butcher's shop and a baker's besides green stalls fish stalls
and chandlers shops which give the place the appearance a public
market while the racquet players and others amusing themselves in
various ways resemble that a fair
indeed said tallyhoho your description is just for i have as yet
seen but few sorrowful faces every one seems to have some object in
view either business or pleasure almost as attractive as those
without the walls
 and in many instances continued dashall as much nay more
interest however you perceive the
 the walls the king's bench are about thirty feet high
surmounted by a chevaux de frieze and as a place 
confinement it is great though uncertain antiquity
accommodation the inmates has been studied by the founders the
college water is well supplied from four pumps and were it not that
the walls intercept the views a man here might almost consider himself
in his own habitation with only one drawback
and what is that enquired tallyhoho
merely that like the starling he can't get out
how now said merry well who had espied the entrance his friends
from the window his apartment and immediately descended to greet
them touching the honourable tom dashall on the shoulder while he
seized bob by the opposite arm
what are you after exploring the secrets the prisonhouse
mutual congratulations having passed merrywell welcomed them to
his habitation significantly informing them at the same time that
notwithstanding his powers entertainment were just then not what he
could wish all was right the trick was done that he was arranging
for a house in the rules pro tempore and that it would not be long
before he should have the honour meeting them in a way that would be
more agreeable to all parties however continued he if you can bear
a confined apartment i promise you shall have nothing else to complain
 can you put up with potluck in a prison
certainly was the reply our object was to spend a convivial hour
with you to wile away a little the time to see and learn to take
a peep at things as they are and to form our judgments upon their
existence
then replied merrywell you have arrived en bon heure for in this
place a volume information may be obtained which if judiciously
applied must prove beneficial and while dinner is preparing i can
afford you abundance amusement so come along we must move round
this way to the gate again in order to take any thing like an accurate
survey and i can furnish some anecdotes the paraders the players
the officers the court and the visitors which cannot fail to prove
interesting this however must be done with caution for suspicion is
ever active and jealousy constantly awake within these walls and as
i mean to give you sketches individual characters rather than a
general view the society with which i am now in association a
little discretion may be well made use 
now let us analyse but not too loud
if wise the composition this crowd
made up from native soil and foreign clime
 waste and folly accident and crime
here join the speculator and the fool
greybeards and youngsters rather tit for school
at least for any school but this alone
where college vices in the shade are thrown
 pugilists haberdashers jugglers
horse jockeys swindlers bond street beaux and smugglers
by hollow friendship some in prison thrown
by others follies some more by their own
by this time they had traversed round the open walk the prison and
on arriving at the place entrance
do you observe that small building on the right it is called the state
house and contains the largest and most convenient rooms it is usually
devoted to the accommodation such as are best enabled to pay and
there are persons residing here who live as well and in as dashing
a style as those without the walls or at least pay as much for their
living on the left hand you may also perceive the chapel for the
spiritual wants those confined are not to be forgotten
there in the centre is the chapel door
with ever changing notices spread o'er
whatever doctrines may within be taught
with words peace that door is rarely fraught
for there mid notices beds for hire
 concerts in the statehouse by desire
some illspelt scrawl demands the mighty debt
 half a crown with a ferocious threat
some traitorous agent is denounced some spy
that blabb'd gin is hung in effigy
here angry fools proclaim the petty jar
and clumsy pasquinades provoke to war
by this time they had reached the door the chapel which by the
various placards pasted against it fully confirmed the description 
merrywell
bob casting his eyes around him discovered much for enquiry who are
those in the corner in close conversation together
the farthest from us replied merrywell is a jew attorney well
acquainted with all the shuffling arts the place one who can
explain the whole game from raising the wind down to the whitewashing
act for the knowledge and experience gentlemen or not so
as to obtain liberation by the whitewashing act no one at present can
tell and melville is taking his walks he is one the janitors and
crier the place he has a stentorian voice which is a part his
business to exercise in calling the prisoners i know but little him
and even that is not worth knowing he however has the character 
being an informer and i am not aware that he is in possession any
good qualities i shall therefore rather give a slight sketch the
office he holds than the person
whoe'er one night has slept within these walls
has heard the din that each new comer calls
to where the keeneyed turnkeys wait to trace
the lineaments every novel face
each morning thro the bench goes forth a cry
by melville sent thro every gallery high
to number one peals round the shout from ten
far rolling heard pull up now gentlemen
this is the custom with every new comer and is productive sometimes 
much mirth to some but infinite mortification to others according
to the circumstances the case as it would occupy some time to
describe them i shall give you a poetical sketch a morning in the
bench and by the introduction a fictitious name make you acquainted
with a general practice imagine for a moment
rous'd by the force that stentorian sound
rose belcour dressed and soon the lobby found
about the door a throng varlet stood
a grinning and illfavoured brotherhood
that scoff and gibe at every wight that wears
linen less black or better coat than theirs
for these young belcour was too fair a mark
make way cries one he's going to the park
his horses wait he's going for a ride
fool tis his tilbury another cried
d'ye think his lordship rides without his spurs
a curse upon such base unmanner'd curs
between his teeth impatient belcour mutter'd
as each his wit so truly attic utter'd
then mid the laughter the brutal throng
dark frowning through the door he moved along
within the upper lobby morris sate
and touch'd with easy complaisance his hat
and cried not deigning from his seat to stir
we hope you're pretty comfortable sir
these chaps about the door are rather rum
but love you so they do to all that come
short was the conference the turnkey's look
quick cognizance belcour's features took
and never from that hour might he pass by
unnoted by that wellobserving eye
well said tallyhoho i must confess such scrutiny on the one part and
such observations on the other would be more than likely to ruffle my
temper and i should be apt to signify my disapprobation at least 
all that was unnecessary
in that case replied merry well you would only subject yourself
to additional torment you would have songs epigrams lampoons and
epitaphs in abundance which would prove still more irritating for this
is the seat learning and wit poets painters and musicians
who being enraptured with their own arts neglect that bookkeeping
till a residence here gives them a leisure opportunity to close their
ledgers
 speaking on that subject by the by we have among us at this
moment the publishers the john bull whose combined efforts in the
way scurrility have rendered them notorious among the periodicals
 present times there is however little public attraction about
them and although they profess to have a subscription opened to enable
them to pay the fine imposed upon them it is doubted whether any
such is really in existence here however is a character another
description
captain k is still a gay fellow though i apprehend rather what we
call hard up just now he has had the opportunity expending a very
considerable property in seeing life but if report say true it has
been chiefly exhausted among the fair sex and coffeehouse keepers
seldom much depressed in spirits let the world wag as it will he
sometimes gives good dinners and enjoys himself with a friend though i
suspect that can under present circumstances only be done when he can
pitch the gammon to the wine merchant and induce him to stand the
nonsense
and do wine merchants give credit to persons in confinement enquired
bob
certainly was the reply for services done or promised to be done
or upon the security some friend who perhaps intends soon after to
pay his engagements by a similar mode to that the person whose debt
he pretends to secure no place can be found where the study ways and
means is more closely attended to than this our prisons in general
much the same may be said as our gaming houses very few get out 
them as they went in a dupe is the general character those who
first enter but they seldom fail to acquire that knave before their
departure the air is infectious the society fatal to morality and
to honesty few pass through the ordeal with purity and return
uncontaminated to the world and yet after all the frauds tricks and
speculations practised it is well to be acquainted with them in order
to guard against the recurrence if a man can but have fortitude enough
to avoid practising them himself
think not that the action the place
is all revealed upon this open space
the darkest portion the picture lies
obscur'd and cover'd up from public eyes
here much you see that bids you all mistrust
much that provokes aversion and disgust
new friends who coolly ask a one pound note
or borrow for an hour then pawn your coat
such stuff as this upon the surface swims
he little sees who but the surface skims
how much fraud and finished wickedness
how much deep despair and keen distress
thought by few and seen by none the while
is clambered in the niches this pile
zounds cried dashall your pictures have so much light and shade
so much to admire and so much to condemn that there is scarcely any
possibility arriving at any conclusion bless me there is dick
bakewell
do you know him said merry well
what the devil are you doing here cried a young man advancing and at
the same time catching the honourable tom dashall by the hand are
you initiated or merely come to take a peep at the curiosities this
menagerie have you tipp'd and shewn yourself in due form or do you
still sport a game leg among the gallants bond street
fortunately said dashall i can still boast the latter and have
no very strong inclination to aspire to all the honour and happiness 
the former
grown serious and sedate i suppose married and cant come pretty
wife lots children love and fireside comfort at home pleasure
abroad cash in hand and care for nobody that's the sort give you joy
with all my heart never were such times
i am glad you find them so continued tom but your anticipations
are a little too rapid and your imagination rather too vivid for my
proceeding however there is no knowing what we may come to life is a
labyrinth full turnings and windings but what brought you here
driven in by the philistines was the reply caught like a harmless
dove by the greeks clean'd out by the cog i was obliged to fly to
this pigeon house in order to avoid being cut up by my creditors and
up to a little the newmarket logic i am now crossing and rustling
though it is doubtful at present who will win the race
you have not far to run however replied dashall and it is
therefore fair to presume the heat will soon be over
 as usual cried rakewell always something short but pungent
like a pinch merrygoup satire and sentiment mirth morality
and good humour unmarried and still the same man these are better
subjects congratulation than the former
we shall dine at half past three said merry well and if you are
inclined to make one along with us you will find me at home
i should have no objection to meet you abroad exclaimed rakewell
but however i'm your man half past three d nd unfashionable but
never mind
i'll pick a bone with you and spite dull care and high walls
locks bolts and bars we'll defy you and my life for it we have
a jolly afternoon is the cellar well stored and the kitchen in good
repair
all right my boy exclaimed merrywell bring your bellows in
good order and don't be afraid your bread basket the dibs are
in tune a ball fires a dose daffy or a blow out black
strap will set the blue devils at defiance give a spur to harmony and
set the spirits a jogging
then at half past three i'll have a turn to with you continued
rakewell so no more at present from your loving cousin i am going now
to call on fred fearnought that fellow has deceived me i thought
him a trump but he's eaten up with hopes and fears tormented in mind
body and estate no more pluck than a dunghill chick i must stir him
up with a long pole give him a lesson or two touch him to the quick
and then quickly adjourn to you so adieu for the present
thus saying he made his escape from his friends and passing through
one the entrances to the interior was quickly out sight
that said dashall addressing his cousin was one the gayest 
the gay in all the leading circles haut ton 
and i assure you said merrywell he has not lost one atom his
vivacity notwithstanding the alteration in his circumstances he is
always full humour ready for a bit fun even in confinement he
plays laughs sings drinks and is about one the most cheerful
companions i know
 merrygoup snuff
 bellows a cant term for the lungs
 breadbasket the stomach
 the dibs are in tune there is plenty money
 a ball fire a glass brandy
then rejoined bob he is a philosopher for he has learned to bear
yes continued dashall but the other and by far the most important
part philosophy is to forbear
that said merry well he yet has to learn and i have my doubts
whether he will accomplish that desirable object while here he has
with a moderate allowance from his father contrived to drive his
fourinhand at times to keep seven or more horses on his hunting and
town establishments has kept some the most dashing and expensive
ladies expensive male company indulged in extravagant habits all
sorts and has twinkled for a while in the highest gambling circles
a run ill luck has at last sent him here but not before he had
honoured almost all the horsedealers coachmakers and saddlers
gunsmiths and tavernkeepers in town with his custom or rather with
his name on their books his father is a man considerable property
which must eventually come to him and he may yet form a conspicuous
figure in high life
what have we here said tallyhoho stopping to read a paper displayed in
the window a barber's shop
the old and only established shop at the prison
price shave well for one penny hair fashionably cut
for twopence at in first staircase round the corner
seventeen in sixteen i don't understand this
each the doors said merry well which lead to the apartments is
numbered as is likewise every room in each passage by which means
much facility is afforded to visitors who come to make a call upon their
friends the operator himself is a prisoner and so are most those
who carry on trades but opportunities are afforded for any person to
come in and supply articles to the inhabitants and at an early hour in
the morning you may hear almost all the cries london
milk matches eggs and epping sausages
greens watercresses chips geranium trees
a brush or broom deal wood cowheel and tripe
fresh butter oranges all round and ripe
rabbits a kettle jug or coffee pot
eels poultry homebak'd bread and rolls all hot
shirt buttons nosegays coals and god knows what
such are the goods that pass the lobby door
cried in all tones that vary squeak and roar
a little further on said merry well is the public kitchen wherefor
a trifling fee cooking is performed for the prisoners and hot
water supplied at a penny per kettle then there is a coffeeroom and
a taproom for general accommodation according to the circumstances 
the inmates so that in point fact there is little to be regretted
here but the loss liberty and the want money
zounds said bob those two articles constitute all that is valuable
in life and in their absence it dwindles into mere existence
and bare existence man to live ordained
wrings and oppresses with enormous weight
i admit the justice the remark for to become an article 
vegetation were it sure continuance would be one the most
irksome as well as degrading situations to which a man could be
reduced but you should recollect that the generality persons who
study in this college expect an early termination their privations
by which hope is kept alive and when the cherished hope is realized 
escaping from these walls all recollection the past is banished
and it is doubtful whether the temporary absence from the possibility
 indulging in folly does not increase the possibility as well as the
power when at liberty
who do you call that man with his hands in his pockets pointing to a
person at a short distance from them at the moment in slovenly attire
and with a vacant countenance
hush replied merry well for we have modest men here as well as
elsewhere men who though they have rendered themselves famous a more
delicate term than notorious are not emulous having their deeds
recorded in history and are indeed very tenacious satisfying
enquiries his name is f rr ter not quite so vacant as he looks for
it is generally speaking not your emptyheaded fellows who can arrive
at the honour a residence here it is rather those brilliant
imagination aspiring talent who have been determined to have money
for a time without heeding the source from which it was derived who
have been up to snuff till they have reduced themselves to the
necessity resting contented with the marrowbone stage instead a
phaeton or a curricle and twopenny in lieu claret the
person you allude to however is brother to cecil f rr ter court
notoriety and has really been in possession considerable property
it is said that his principal failing has been too strong an inclination
to resort to the law and that upon the law and lawyers he has expended
the bulk his fortune
he cuts a curious figure now however said tallyhoho and every view
at first sight would take him for a fortunate youth
do you observe that man in mustachios now talking with p s that
is captain r n who bears a more striking resemblance in character to
the celebrated youth you mention he had at one time inspired a belief
among those who knew him that he was a man property married with a
view to realize it and upon comparing notes after the nuptial knot
was tied both parties discovered they were taken in but it is not
ascertained whether this mutual disappointment ended with smiles
why it was no laughing matter said tom the lucky hit was all a
miss
yes there was a miss taken and a biter bit love is a lottery as well
as life and the chances two to one against the adventurer replied
dashall
it may be so said merrywell i am not fly to the subject
at present perhaps sparkle could by this time unravel some its
mysteries and give beneficial lessons to us all however time is
flying we will just make one more turn and then to dinner with what
appetite we may do you observe the pericranium topp'd with a prussian
cap and the wearer with a pipe in his mouth
 fit to be up to any thing to understand to know or be
awake
i was on the point enquiry said bob pray who is he
that is another captain
who one would almost think you have the whole army martyrs confined
here said tallyhoho at all events your ranks are not deficient 
officers
but then said dashall they are out commission and out 
practice
for want command continued merrywell though capt s 
although never made a commander in chief has been an exalted character
having once been made inspector the pavement or in other
words snapped the stoop and if report says true he has also figured
away in other situations equally honourable a flash turf man a naval
character and a smuggler but come i have given you a sort index by
which you may read mark and learn more when we are more at leisure
it is now half past three o'clock and punctuality is always my motto
 inspector the pavement or snapped the stoop cant term
for the pillory
humph ejaculated tom cash down and no grumbling
d n severity was the reply no more that or we cut touch my
honour and you touch my life
dot and go one cried dashall come along bob and catching his
cousin by the arm they followed merrywell in silence to his apartment
in the state house
on arrival they found the dinner on table and bakewell true to his
appointment arrived before them the keen air surrey though
rather confined had furnished them with good appetites apologies
were banished and to it they went without let hinderance or
molestation the viands were good the wines exquisite and plentiful
the cloth being removed mirth and conviviality were the order the
day
confusion to soft heads and hard hearts parks and pleasure ground s
without priories were drank in bumpers with enthusiastic applause the
merriment and hilarity merrywell and his fellow student crowned the
afternoon with as much pleasure and delight as bob conceived he
could have found under unlimited circumstances the good humour and
hospitality the host was manifested in the perfect satisfaction 
those he entertained and about eight o'clock when rakewell began to
mangle his mother tongue our friends after dropping their mites
into the canisters held out for their bounty repassed the gates well
pleased and highly diverted with the information they had obtained
and the occurrences the day and not a little exhilarated by the
bacchanalian juice
well said tallyhoho this is a scene real life which i should
judge could scarcely be equalled and would almost induce one to wish
for an opportunity a residence along with the collegians
 provided always nevertheless with an equal opportunity leaving
it when we please said dashall and probably we have only seen one
 the best pictures it contains for although we have been as jolly as
sandboys there is a large store misery unseen but let us proceed
we shall soon be free from college rules and a thought strikes me that
we can make a call on our road that will afford another view society
equally amusing and refreshing i have often observed to you that in
order to see life there is no necessity to bus about with court flies
to waste time and money in getting introduced to the tip tops the
west to join what are termed the fashionable circles and to a
fashionable career by a whereas or a whitewashing the true student 
real life should occasionally mingle with all descriptions persons
mark the characters and their conduct and believe me there are those
in the humblest situations who enjoy themselves in their own way with
as much heartfelt satisfaction as those in the highest which
i think i shall be able to give you a decided proof before we reach
home
they now pursued their way along the london road and over westminster
bridge till tom called a halt at the door a friend
come bob said he here we must unease doff the present toggery
and turn out in new trim for the evening
what enquired bob another masquerade
no no was the reply a temporary suspension the dress and
character a gentleman in order to avoid being tormented and
suspected by the company to which i intend to introduce you
finding his friend at home they were quickly supplied with tatter'd
garments and slouched hats in which they again sallied forth and about
nine o'clock they entered a low publichouse in scotlandyard
illustration pages public house
fear nothing said tom as they passed the threshold don't be
flurried by any thing said to you tis only a heavywet party among the
coalheaving coves
as bob entered the room his very first action betrayed him for being
accustomed to genteel behaviour he took off his hat which was in a
moment knocked out his hand by a hard featured fellow near him whose
face indicated the want water although so near the river
 order order was vociferated in an instant by a jolly
goodnatured looking man exalted above the rest who at the
same moment rapped the table with his knuckles this here way
gentlemen bill muggins mind you i ain't had your penny in the plate
for back
vy that's a lie roar'd out a stentorian voice i never takes my
seat before i sees my way clear upon the board i put a crooked ha
penny
yes and two bad gardens what an't worth nothing said another make
him tip cried a third or else stick him in the nitch
 stick him in the pitch send him to coventry
bob having regained his castor followed his cousin to the other 
 the room and after each depositing a penny in the plate they took
their seats at the table where being supplied with a flowing quart
they began to look around them
the first thing which struck tallyhoho's eye was no trust printed inlarge
letters at one the room a sort indication that a man
without money would not be likely to meet with agreeable entertainment
then turning his head the other way he discovered they were in a
house call for coal porters before the president who by way 
distinction had turned the broad flap his coalheaving hat forward
in the fashion a huntsman's cap was placed a small round table on
which stood a gallon measure heavy wet on his right sat a wornout
workman fast asleep and occasionally affording his friends around him a
snoring accompaniment to a roar laughter
silence silence vy don't you all be more quieter when i am going to
begin
order order chair chair now resounded from every one
well you know its no use at all for to make me take this here chair
because vy i an't got no voice
i knows better nor that said bill muggins for by wen you fell
overboard the other day you roared like a rum un and wen i pulled you
out you squeaked like a pig so that are proves what you have got two
voices and that's one more than you ought to have lord lord if you
had but seen him and i get drunk after it you would ha laughed dick
bolted blue ruin till his eyes sparkled just for all the world like a
wooden spoon against a soot bag
 a general laugh succeeded this sally which was accompanied by the
speaker with a violent blow upon the table which threatened confusion
to the candles glasses and porterpots with which it was loaded
veil continued the chairman you know its all my eye i an't got nosing
in me so if you're a mind to be friendly will you heave out
vy you know dick for the matter o that are i never refuses you
nothing nor what's more i never vont so here goes
what a hearty blade am i
care cant never touch my heart
every trouble i defy
while i views the foaming quart
a very good song and very well sung
jolly companions every one
clap your hats on keep your heads vain
a little more liquor will do us no harm
blankets and pins blankets and pins
when a man's married his sorrow begins
the six last lines were repeated as a chorus till every one appeared
to be exhausted and was succeeded by thunders approbation and
reiterated cries well done bill go it bill bill muggins forever
and the still unabated snoring their companion in the corner
bill muggins ant nothing but a goodman gemmensaid the president
here's his health landlord bring him a bolus blue ruin i say
bill what shall ve say after that are good song
here's bad luck and no blue ruin to bad masters and leg o mutton and
turnips for trumps that's all i got to say so here goes
the toast being drank
who is ve to call on now bill
vy bob martlet's the boy to come it strong
bob martlet was accordingly called upon but requested a few minutes to
prepare himself as he was rather hoarse
during this interregnum dashall slipped out the room and gave the
landlord an order to place two bowls punch on the tables cautioning
him at the same time to say nothing the party who paid for it but
to say that a gentleman passing by the door and hearing them all merry
had given an order for it at the bar
 upon reentering the room bob martlet with one eye bound up and
his hat in his hand was bawling with lungs leather
lovely nymph assuage my anguish
at thy feet a tender swain
prays you will not let him languish
one kind look would ease his pain
did you know the lad who courts you
he not long need sue in vain
prince song and dance you
scarce will meet his like again
as this was a song to be sung in character bob martlet determined to
profit by the instructions shakspeare to suit the action to the
word and the word to the action and consequently at the word dance
he introduced some steps to the great entertainment the company
but unfortunately jigging to another tune in which all the broad brims
joined he forgot the connexion the words and was compelled to sing
it over again and to give his hornpipe by way conclusion which was
accompanied by the barking a dog
tallyhoho laughed heartily at this the grotesque appearance the
tender swain and the dance in wooden shoes were admirable and
highly relished by his companions the room resounded with applause
and it was some moments before silence could be obtained when lo and
behold the landlord entered the room as a peacebreaker with two bowls
 punch
consternation and surprise were visible in every countenance the
confusion tongues could scarcely equal the enquiries made in a
moment but the landlord having his cue made no reply but there
it is will you drink it it is all your own and to set you a good
example here goes success to trade and took a hearty swig from the
bowl he placed before the president then taking the other bowl to the
lower the room he evaporated but soon returned with
glasses where he came from or how it was obtained was banished from
consideration and to make more the remnant a pot heavy wet was
thrown into the bowl to mellow it as the president observed because
vy he liked things mellow the punch was handed about the song and the
toast passed merrily in succession till near twelve when an unlucky
disturber harmony with a candle set fire to the whisker hill
the flue maker so called from his having in his younger days been
a chimneysweeper hill who had slept during the noise the evening
was notwithstanding his former trade not fireproof awoke in a flame
and not knowing the real depredator upset the president and nearly
knock'd him through a window just behind him milled away in all
directions growling with as much melody as he had before snored during
the confusion this affray tom and bob took their departure from
charley's crib which they understood was a nickname given to the place
and throwing themselves into a rattler soon arrived in piccadilly
where we shall for the present leave them to their repose
chapter v
since life's but a jest let us follow the rule
there's nothing so pleasant as playing the fool
in town we may practise as well as at school
the world turns about the same things o'er and o'er
we fool it our forefathers fool'd it before
they did what we do which our sons will encore
life's but a half holiday lent us to stare
we wander and wonder in vanity's fair
all babylike bawling for each bawble there
we children like covet the glitter gay things
make racket for ribbands and such sort playthings
which we cannot have tho without we can say things
we take or are in all our turns taken in
the world to be sure tis a shame and a sin
might soon be much better but who will begin
 london said the hon tom dashall to his cousin abounds with
so much munificence that notwithstanding all its intricacies and
inconveniences he who travels through life without visiting it may
justly be said to know nothing for it is all life its remotest corners
are full animation and although it is difficult to fancy how all
live there are few but could give some satisfactory information if they
chose though i am willing to believe many would rather wish to avoid
interrogation we have already explored some parts it but be assured
there is still much to admire much to applaud and much to deprecate
our researches after all have been rather confined than extensive it
is such an ever varying and never ceasing mine observation that it
is almost like the wishing cap fortunatus with this exception that
although every wish may be supplied it requires something more than
putting on the cap to obtain the object desired
 from what i have already seen replied tallyhoho i perfectly
coincide with you in the latter part your observation for i have no
doubt but perseverance and integrity with some portion ability is
sure to meet reward
you are right continued tom many instances could be pointed out
in proof the justice that remark some the greatest men the
present day have rose from the lowest origin shopboys and porters have
become tradesmen and merchants shoeblacks have become statesmen and
servants councillors but on the other hand many who have been born as
the old saying is with a silver spoon in their mouths have fallen
from their high estates and lingered out the latter parts their
lives in prisons or workhouses laying the blame on fate rather than
attributing failure to their own want ability prudence or active
exertion but come i perceive the curricle is ready let us take
a spank through the city and look a little more minutely at the
mercantile world
this call was instantly obeyed by tallyhoho who never doubted but
his cousin had some object in view though he frequently started from
piccadilly without being previously acquainted with it
passing out at hyde park corner bon remarked that he thought the city
lay the other way
never mind replied dashall we shall come to the point without
doubt why man there are more ways than one and i am not particularly
partial to being blocked up in the public streets amidst knowing
surveys and cramp carmen sugar hogsheads molasses and slush carts
which is so frequently the case when by a slight deviation from the
direct way we can give the tits a rattler on a good road without
obstruction and pocket a handful time into the bargain
he now turned into the road which leads directly to vauxhall bridge on
arriving at which tallyhoho was much delighted with an extensive view 
the thames
this said dashall will bring us to a favourite place amusement
where you have already cut a conspicuous figure
what do you mean enquired his cousin
a masquerade replied he significantly go along bob
 passing gently over the bridge do you observe continued he
that extensive building that is called the penitentiary it is a
building designed for the punishment employment and reformation 
offenders secondary turpitude usually punished by transportation
for a term years it has been conceived since the commencement the
disputes which terminated in the separation the american states
the plan it is known to be partly that mr jeremy bentham the
culprits are confined in circular buildings the windows which are so
constructed that the overseer from his room in the centre may be able
to view every one their rooms the external wall encloses no less
than eighteen acres ground within which are six these circular
buildings each capable lodging and employing from to 
prisoners with a chapel infirmary and other conveniences its
situation is called millbank
it looks said bob like a castle or tower impregnable
strength
it is however continued tom a useful institution since it
supersedes that indiscriminate transportation so long practised and
which as applied to definite periods was cruel and unjust since the
wretched objects were precluded from the power ever returning
to their native land however short the intended period their
banishment this part the world is much improved late years the
bridge we are now passing is an admirable light and elegant structure
but recently erected according to the plan mr j walker and
connects as you perceive by a straight line road with hyde park
corner the road before us leads to lexington cross and thence by
various ways to the city the bridge consists nine arches equal
span in squares cast iron on piers rusticated stone formed 
fragments united by means parker's cement its width is feet
the span the arches feet the height feet and the clear
breadth the road way is feet it cost above l but we
shall shortly cross another bridge far surpassing it in point 
magnificence
it is wonderful indeed said bob that in a country complaining 
a starving population such serious sums money should be expended in
the erection splendid mansions and magnificent bridges
 not at all was the reply for perhaps it is one the
best ways expending as it gives employment to thousands who would
otherwise have become beggars on private charity or paupers on public
bounty either which is revolting to the mind an englishman
besides if your observation applied at all it would cut at every
improvement the day and you should recollect that whether upon
true foundations or not every generation think the age they live in is
the most enlightened so it may be with respect to the preceding and
indeed so much so that the succeeding will rather decline than improve
upon it but it would be difficult to convince them the fact it is
certain however that scarcely a day passes but some new invention or
improvement is offered to public notice the perusal the newspapers
is an evidence my assertion and as london is the centre 
attraction so it is the seat knowledge science and information
i should judge that if a person who had lived some two hundred years
ago even in this wild place were to rise up amongst us his surprise
and astonishment would be strongly excited said bob endeavouring to
draw forth more his observations as they bowled along the road
there can be no question on that subject said tom for how would the
high ideas he entertained the ingenuity the age in which he had
lived dwindle into nothing nay should he appear in the country
first what would he think the various implements husbandry for
ploughing and preparing the land the different machines for sowing
the corn for threshing grinding and dressing it and in numerous
instances though perhaps not quite so much now as it has been on
account the present agricultural distresses he would find something
else too which he might not consider an improvement instead meeting
the honest homely farmer assisting personally in the gathering in his
crops and his daughter following the cart with a rake he would find
the former mounted on his pray following the hounds and the latter at
boarding school instead the farmer's son bringing home his cows 
an evening and his sister going out to meet him at the sound his
well known voice with her milkwhite pail he would find the one poring
over latin and greek and the other running her fingers over the chords
 a harp or pianoforte
 these said bob are refinements in manners at least
then should he take a peep at london as we are now doing he would be
struck dumb with admiration but here we are on the waterloo road that
building on the right is the coburg theatre so named in compliment
to the prince saxe coburg who married the unfortunate princess
charlotte wales the much regretted daughter our present king
before us is waterloo bridge which leads to the strand and was
originally denominated the strand bridge it is acknowledged to be
one the most majestic structures the kind perhaps in the known
world and was built under the direction the late mr jennie to
whose memory it is said a monument is intended to be erected the bridge
consists nine equal arches and like the bridges the ancients
is perfectly flat which you perceive the road we are now travelling is
not for in some instances you may look over the wall upon another world
below as we are above the tops the houses its being level is a
circumstance highly favourable to the draught carriages across it
and without any apparent subtraction from its beauty we will alight
here and walk leisurely across taking time for remark
the servants now took charge the curricle with orders to wait at the
corner the strand while our heroes having each deposited his penny
at the tollhouse strolled forward
tallyhoho appeared delighted with the views around him in the front a
fine prospect one the finest cities in the world and behind an
equally pleasing sight over the surrey hills the day being fine
and the sun darting his refulgent beams on the bosom the thames
contributed to form altogether one the most enraptured sights he
had ever beheld the passing and repassing boats and barges
below and carriages horsemen and pedestrians crossing the bridge
alternately attracted his attention
each arch this bridge said dashall is feet span the piers
 feet thick with tuscan columns the width between the parapets 
feet these footpaths are seven feet each and the roadway is 
feet the cost has been immense and it is not likely that the original
subscribers will ever realize the capital expended
 at this moment the sound music attracted the ears tallyhoho
what have we here said he thrusting his head through the
balustrades by which he found himself almost suffocated with smoke
which stopped further enquiry
behold said tom another improvement the age that is the
richmond steam boat proceeding with a cargo live stock to that
celebrated place public resort and in spite wind and weather
will return in the evening they always have a band music on board
for the amusement their passengers
zounds said bob they ought to have a smokeconsumer
they had one just now replied tom for i apprehend you assisted them
in some degree though not voluntarily
you are smoking me said bob
never mind you have only been puffing a cloud
however as the mist is dispelled said tallyhoho and we have a clear
sky before us again let us make use our senses
to the right you perceive blacksmiths bridge and beyond that the
southwark bridge by the way we were speaking the alterations to be
witnessed in a country life we will now pursue the subject and suppose
for a moment our twothousandyearsago friend after his visit among
the swains inclined to transfer his observations to the great town the
first question would be how shall i get there oh there are plenty 
night coaches and day coaches too sir well then fancy him seated ina
night coach and having supped on the road on resuming his corner
 the vehicle he falls into a sound sleep guess what must be his
surprise on waking in the morning to find himself in the bustle and
apparent confusion the streets the metropolis but how altered
wide streets and upright houses instead narrow lanes with houses
meeting each other at the tops then what elegant shops he would
exclaim rubbing his eyes why this is all a dream
proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
 it cannot be reality however he swallows a hasty breakfast
and sallies out again to look about him from london bridge he espies
the one i have just mentioned the southwark bridge what have we
here oh sir that is the castiron bridge with three arches
over the thames he hastens to it and when upon it what must be his
astonishment at the power the human mind to form and the human
body to bring together such immense pieces iron to connect queen
street cheapside with the kent and surrey roads by three arches the
centre which is feet span and the side ones feet each the
arches all composed cast iron the piers and abutments stone
zounds he would exclaim if the race man dwindle in stature they
grow daily more stupendous in intellect but we will suppose like
you with an anxiety to see all that can be seen he perceives a machine
sailing down the river with astonishing velocity why formerly said
he wind and tide against a vessel were insurmountable obstacles in its
passage but now they seem to add to its swiftness how is this to be
accounted for easily enough replies a byestander lord
bless you it's all done by steam hot water and smoke do every thing
nowadays why there are a great number machines which formerly
required from two to forty or more horses each to put and keep in
motion entirely worked by the steam arising from boiling water 
prodigious steam do all that astonishing
and truly replied bob notwithstanding i have witnessed many
improvements i confess i am astonished at the various uses to which
this discovery has already been devoted and the extraordinary powers it
possesses
well we will pursue the train thought a little further suppose
perambulating the streets till he is quite tired and seeing alterations
and changes out number he enters a coffee house eats a hearty meal
and taking a glass or two wine he falls into a musing train ideas
 the wonders he has been witnessing from which he is not disturbed
till the hoarse voice a charley sounds in his ear past ten o'clock
and a cloudy night at which he hastily starts up discharges his bill
and prepares by buttoning up close and securing his trusty stick for
as he would naturally expect a dull dreary walk he sallies out thus
equipped and to his utter astonishment finds the streets as busy as
in the middle the day and almost as light he steps up to one the
lights to examine it what can this be it is not oil there is
no vessel to contain it surely this can't be steam also but what can
it be gas sir says a passenger who overhears the question gas
it is produced from coals set on fire and confined in a furnace the
subtle vapour from which is conveyed by means pipes and light
applied to it immediately bursts into a flame his astonishment would
now be complete and if he did sleep after it would be difficult to
persuade him it was not all a dream
our wise forefathers knew the worth land
and banked the thames out with laborious hand
from fresh encroachments bound it's restless tide
within a spacious channel deep and wide
with equal pains revers'd their grandsons make
on the same spot a little inland lake
where browsing sheep or grazing cattle fed
the wondrous waters new dominion spread
where rows houses stood through many a street
now rows ships present a little fleet
nay we had made had nature not refus'd
had father thames not begg'd to be excus'd
a pretty tunnel underneath his bed
and left him running grumbling over head
had scratch'd a track out like a grubbing mole
through a long dark and damp and dirty hole
like rats in sewers had floundered through the mud
instead sailing ducklike o'er the flood
but bubbling springs choked up the project deep
and trickling waters on our folly weep
by this time they had crossed the bridge and having regained the
curricle the hon tom dashall tickled the tits in prime style along
the strand in the road to the city soon after passing temple bar they
were attracted by a vast concourse persons surrounding the shop 
mr carlile from whence upon enquiry they learnt the
 perhaps some the most remarkable occurrences in the
city london have taken place at the house carlisle the
whole family have been tried and convicted selling
treasonable or seditious works and are now suffering the
sentence the law but notwithstanding the combined
efforts a powerful body the shop is kept open and it is
more than likely that a greater business is carried on now
than ever in a recent number the republican published
by him he makes the following observations
since my last went to press we have thought it prudent to
resort to stratagem to defeat the schemes the gang intaking
out every new hand from the shop by a warrant we
now sell all publications to suspicious and unsuspicious
customers through a hole in a part the shop where it is
impossible for the purchaser to identify the seller as
there are always two or three serving in the back ground
none whom can be seen or heard to be identified
individually these persons are frequently changed so that
even if the enemy resorted to burglary and housebreaking
upon the strength any warrant the seller any pamphlet
or pamphlets could not be identified where the statue 
paine stood we are about to caricature the defeat murray
and sharpe and make them watch the hole through which the
money and pamphlets pass without being able to prevent it
there are fifty stratagems by which i could give full effect
to the sale my publications as well as if they were
sold openly and which would defy prosecution as the vender
could not be identified i dislike this mode doing
business i like open fair play and i now considerable taste by which
the interior the church has been much improved in appearance
after having examined these stately and expressive mementos 
mortality the two visitors were asked by their attendant whether they
would pass to the stone and iron galleries outside the church but
this having so lately enjoyed the extensive prospect from the monument
they declined and proceeded at once to the library the first object to
be seen in the ascent
our two visitors were very much pleased with this handsome room which
in its dimensions is about fifty feet by forty having shelves books
to the top with a gallery
 the statues dr johnson and howard the philanthropist
both executed by the late mr bacon were opened for public
inspection in that dr johnson represents a moral
philosopher with the attitude and expression intense
thought leaning against a column indicative the
firmness mind and stability principles the man whom
it is intended to commemorate
the statue howard in which the character active
benevolence is well expressed stands upon a pedestal 
white marble on which is a group basrelief
representing a scene in a prison where the philanthropist
having broken the chains the prisoners is bringing
provision and clothing for their relief
the statue sir william jones a man well known for his
extensive and multifarious erudition whose study it was to
make the british name honoured and revered amongst the
nations the east is also the work bacon and was
erected by the east india company
amongst the monuments lately raised in commemoration departed
worth is that nelson and in design and execution
it is not exceeded by any in the cathedral
in the open part the cathedral the stranger will be
struck with the appearance numerous tattered flags the
trophies british valour those over the aisle leading
from the western door were taken in part during the
american war and the rest by the duke york at
valenciennes those on both sides near the north door were
reprisals made from the french by lord howe on the st 
june opposite to which on the right hand are the
flags taken from the spaniards by lord nelson in and
on the left are those taken from the dutch by lord duncan
at camperdown and by lord keith at the cape good hope
running along the sides the floor is oak consisting 
small square pieces and is not only curious for its being inlaid
without a nail or a peg to fasten the parts but is very neat in the
workmanship and beautiful in its appearance the principal things
pointed out to a stranger are several carved stone pillars some latin
manuscripts written by monks years ago and an english manuscript
illuminated containing rules for the government a convent written
in old english about years since all in fine preservation
the clockwork and the great bell were the next curiosities that
attracted the attention our visitants on the latter weighing
lbs the hammer the clock strikes the hours it was now noon
and the ponderous hammer put itself into motion and slowly yet with
astounding impetus struck the bell and the reverberation tingled on
the auricular organs the two strangers with painful and stunning
effect throughout the long protracted intimation the hour nor was it
until a considerable time had elapsed that their hearing recovered from
the clanging agitation
 this bell is never tolled but upon the death some 
the royal family the bishop london or the dean 
st paul's and then the clapper is moved and not the bell
in the stillness night the indication the hour by the
deeply sonorous tone this bell may be heard not merely
over the immense metropolis but in distant parts the
country the fact is well known the sentry at windsor
who when accused having been asleep one night on his
post denied the charge saying that he had been listening
to st paul's in london which had just struck thirteen
and this assertion was upon enquiry satisfactorily
corroborated
they were now ushered into the whispering gallery which is
constructed on the very simple principle an unbroken communication
it is yards in circumference and a stone seat runs round the
gallery along the foot the wall on the side directly opposite to the
entrance door dashall and his friend seated themselves when the person
who shewed the gallery whispered close to the door at the distance
 feet and yet they heard his voice seemingly at their ear the
shutting the door resembled a clap thunder from this gallery
round the inner circle which is an iron balustrade the marble
pavement the church exhibits a beautiful appearance and the
paintings the dome which have greatly suffered by time are
thence seen to the greatest advantage
the ascent to the ball is attended by some difficulty and is
not encountered by many our two visitants therefore declined its
inspection the interior diameter the ball is six feet two inches
and will contain twelve persons
 a new ball and cross have lately replaced the former 
similar dimensions the erection the scaffolding and
subsequent proceedings the workmen at so fearful a
height from the haunts men excited a very general
interest more particularly so on the recent happy
accomplishment the undertaking when the intrepid
aeronauts cheered the admiring multitude far beneath and
seated in the clouds like the deities mount olympus
drank to the prosperity their friends in the nether
regions
the best view the metropolis is obtained in a clear day from the
gallery at the foot the lantern the diminutive appearance the
passengers and other objects beneath is extremely amusing and resembles
the elfin panorama the capital lilliput
the calm serenity the interior the awful grandeur the structure
itself and the reflections arising from the contemplation monuments
erected to the memory departed worth with the splendid achievements
 heroic minds formed a strange contrast to the scene which presented
itself to their view on leaving this magnificent pile the hurry
bustle and confusion the street the noisy vociferations 
coachmen carmen c burst upon their senses at a moment when the mind
had been soothed by reflection and the eye gratified with a sight which
led imagination into futurity before which the past and the present
had appeared to evaporate the hon tom dashall however was quickly
recalled by observing his curricle so completely hemmed in between
contending parties to obtain liberation at the corner paul's chain
as to afford but little chance escape from its intricate situation
for some time
zounds said tom we had better return and take a seat among the
worthies within for i have no idea mounting the curricle to sit and
be quizzed
any chance said bob is better than that but at all events your man
is able to take care the carriage and cattle and we are competent to
the care ourselves
well hinted replied tom and it shall be acted upon
 thus saying he made his way through the throng and gave orders
for the curricle to proceed home as soon as it could be extricated from
its present confinement then returning to his cousin
it is not the first time i have been disappointed i had made up
my mind to proceed much farther but the very scenes we have been
inspecting are proofs the inability man to perform all his wishes
although equally a proof the splendid talents and deter she is matronly
appearance and was well dressed the mobility received her with due
respect the lady made her obeisance and the assemblage retired on
terms apparently reciprocal satisfaction
strolling onwards until they gained the centre blacksmiths bridge
the two friends paused in admiration the interesting scene before
them
amidst the spires and turrets the metropolis saint paul's close
at hand rose in the proud preeminence stupendous grandeur like a
mighty monarch surrounded by tributary kings rendering him the
homage vassalage
emerging from the dense mass buildings on the line from the tower
to westminster abbey appeared a continued succession prominent
public edifices on the river thames the scene was diversified by
numerous wherries gliding pleasurably on the rippling wave some
shooting under the arches the elegant waterloo and others under the
spacious span the lofty iron bridge southwark while on either
side the river labour was on the alert and the busy and ceaseless hum
 industry resounded far and near
twas low water and the mudlarks now intent on their several
vocations engaged the eye the squire what are those people
about he asked what are they in search 
these are mudlarks answered his friend in search what chance
may throw in their way all's fish that comes to net you have much
to learn yet real life in london and must prolong your stay
accordingly willing to eat the bread honesty these poor people
are in the daily practice frequenting the shores the thames to
literally pick up a living nothing comes amiss all that is portable
however insignificant in value goes into the general repository
the mudlark returns home when his labours are ended sorts the
indiscriminate heterogeneous mass matter and disposes it as
well as he can
 how many hundreds and thousands in a metropolis like that
 the british empire obtain a subsistence in a way 
which those its inhabitants who are not compelled to such
an exercise their ingenuity can have no idea in the
midst a crowded city man is much more closely cut off
from all assistance on the part his fellows and is
obliged to trust entirely for the support life to the
individual exertions his strength his talents or his
ingenuity various and singular are the expedients practised
by numbers in the british capital among these the class 
mudlarks is not the least extraordinary that is people
who on the ebb the tide repair to the riverside inquest
 any article that the water may have left behind in
the mud to this description people belonged peggy jones
the well known mudlark at black friars she was a woman
apparently about forty years age with red hair the
particular object whose researches was the coals which
accidentally fell from the sides the lighters her
constant resort was the neighbourhood blacksmiths where
she was always to be seen even before the tide was down
wading into the water nearly up to the middle and scraping
together from the bottom the coals which she felt with her
feet numbers passengers who have passed by that quarter
particularly over blacksmiths bridge have often stopped to
contemplate with astonishment a female engaged in an
occupation apparently so painful and disagreeable she
appeared dressed in very short ragged petticoats without
shoes or stockings and with a kind apron made some
strong substance that folded like a bag all round her in
which she collected whatever she was so fortunate as to
find in these strange habiliments and her legs encrusted
with mud she traversed the streets this metropolis
sometimes she was industrious enough to pick up three and
at others even four loads a day and as they consisted
entirely what are termed round coals she was never at a
loss for customers whom she charged at the rate eighteen
a load in the collection her sable treasure she
was frequently assisted by the coalheavers who when she
happened to approach the lighters would as if
unfeignedly kick overboard a large coal at the same time
bidding her with apparent surliness go about her business
peggy jones was not exempt from a failing to which most
individuals the lower orders are subject namely
inebriety her propensity to liquor was sometimes indulged
to such a degree that she would tumble about the streets
with her load to the no small amusement mischievous
boys and others who on such occasions never failed to
collect around her after concluding the labors the day
she retired to a wretched lodging in chick lane this woman
carried on her extraordinary calling for many years but
about the month february she suddenly disappeared
from her usual places resort and nobody can tell what is
become her a man who has the appearance a coalheaver
has since stepped into her place and adopted the
profession which she so long followed
 thus it is that the mudlark earns a precarious and scanty
subsistence and in many other instances in this metropolis ingenuity
and perseverance overcome difficulties that in the country would prove
insurmountable
retracing their steps to ludgatehill the associates passed into the
old bailey where the squire seemed struck with surprise at the simple
bill fare an eatinghouse not inscribed on paper and exhibited
against the window but deeply engraved on brass and conspicuously
fixed by the side the door expressed in four syllables only the
boil'dbeef house compendious enough exclaimed his cousin multum
in pavo rejoined the squire and immediately walking in they
were ushered into a snug room partly occupied by guests apparent
respectability each actively employed in the demolition buttock or
flank with great seeming satisfaction the two strangers intimating a
desire to follow so laudable an example the waiter submissively put the
question which would you please to have gentlemen buttock or flank
or a plate both that the quality each might be ascertained
plates both were ordered and presently brought in piping hot and
in the first style culinary perfection
 it was amusing to observe the characteristic features the
different guests
the young man hurrying over his meal and frequently casting a look on
the dial indicated a tradesman's bookkeeper desirous enjoying his
pipe and pint ere the allotted dinner hour expired when he must return
to his desk
another meagre and cadaverous appearance had his plate replenished
thrice repeated and each time dispatched the contents with astonishing
celerity this man without doubt was either a poet or a bookseller's
hack who probably had not for sometime enjoyed the novelty a
dinner and was thus making atonement to appetite accordingly
one gentleman fashionably attired kept mincing his meat and at long
intervals supplying estimates that seemed not at all alert in the
performance their office his attention was given rather to the
company than to his plate and was particularly directed to dashall
and tallyhoho on whom it alternately settled with fixed and favourite
regard this very polite personage was assiduously eager by every
possible courtesy to ingratiate himself into the notice our two
friends but dashall was a knowing fish so the bait wouldn't take
and the squire happening to ejaculate the word younger the stranger
prudently took the hint and withdrew
 thirty years ago this house was noted for the excellent
quality its boiled beef no other meat is ever drest
here hobson's choice or none during that period it has
had several occupants and each has retired with a very
considerable fortune in the decided superiority its
buttock and flank the house still sustains its pristine
reputation
 these gentry are hardly to be distinguished from the
hangeron except by being if possible more impudent they
frequent all places public resort in order to pick up a
dinner or a bottle and otherwise prey upon the credulity 
the unwary whenever they meet with a countryman they
salute him with enquiring the time day or describing the
weather and entertaining him with a story little
consequence till they have artfully wheedled you into an
invitation to dine or sup with you they can tell you where
the best entertainment is to be met with which is the best
comedian can get you introduced to see such an actress to
hear this sing or that spout will provide you with the best
seat at the playhouse or keep a place for you in the front
row the first gallery should you prefer it to the pit
can procure a ticket for the exhibition rooms for half
price and explain every thing in the museum as well as the
librarians themselves if your inclination is for mischief
he is the only man in the world to assist you would you
break the lamps or mill the charleys he will stand by and
cry bravo till you are carried to the watchhouse but will
not engage in the quarrel himself acting only as a corps
de reserve when you are taken he will negotiate with the
constable the night about your ransom for which you must
pay smartly otherwise be detained till justice opens her
doors to descry and punish your enormities according to the
nature the crime committed upon which the younger says
that he foresaw and told you the consequences that would
happen if you persevered but that you would not listen to
his advice
 having done satisfactory justice to the buttock and flank and
further refreshed themselves with a draught whitehead's entire
our pedestrians leaving the boil'd beef house recommenced their
excursion by proceeding up the old bailey when dashall remarking on the
number eating houses with which that street abounds observed that
it seemed a favorite seat consolidation for the professors the
culinary art like clothfair for woollendrapers paternosterrow for
booksellers and clerkenwell for watchmakers c this said dashall
is his majesty's gaol newgate and from this door ascend the
numerous victims to the fatal scaffold in immolation to the offended
laws their country let us enter this temporary abode crime
and wretchedness it has been much meliorated by the humane and
indefatigable attentions an excellent lady mrs elizabeth fry and
i am desirous seeing the result her philanthropic exertions the
gentlemanly appearance and demeanour the two strangers facilitated
their admission and they entered the prison preceded by one the
turnkeys who courteously had proffered his services in shewing the
place and giving every required information
newgate on the eastern side the old bailey has been rebuilt its
walls or shell excepted since it was destroyed by the rioters in the
year a broad yard divides newgate from the sessions house a very
handsome stone and brick building another edifice where that lately
stood commonly called surgeon's hall has been erected it is arched
underneath and supported upon pillars and is used as a place 
accommodation for witnesses and other persons while waiting for the
trials during session time
 this prison until within these few years back was a place 
confinement as well for debtors as felons but by late arrangements
and the erection the new gaol in whitecrossstreet newgate has now
become the receptacle felons only
 newgate has been the scene two remarkable events which
frequently serve as eras reckoning to some the
inhabitants london the first is that the memorable
riots in when this imposing edifice was attacked by a
furious mob in the evening monday the th june who by
breaking the windows batterking the entrances the cells
with sledge hammers and pickaxes and climbing the walls
with ladders found means to enter mr german's house
communicating with the prison and eventually liberated
three hundred prisoners the next these events occursed
on the rd february this was when haggard and
holloway were to suffer for the murder mr steele on
hourslow heath the populace began to assemble so early as
five o'clock and to accumulate until eight it is supposed
that the concourse people was greater than at the
execution governor wall at eight o'clock the prisoners
ascended the scaffold immediately after they were launched
off a most dreadful scene took place the approaches to the
place were completely blocked up with carts filled with
spectators and when some the crowd began to move away
the pressure became dreadful some fell and others falling
over them they were trampled to death terror took
possession the crowd they became desperate and their
efforts only contributed to increase their danger as soon
as this frightful confusion ceased fortytwo sufferers in
the scene were carried to st bartholomew's hospital 
these twentyseven were dead and though every effort was
made for their resuscitation in not one instance was it
crowned with success fortytwo the whole number five
were women and three them were among the dead the
remaining twentyfour bodies five were men and the rest
lads from twelve to seventeen years age among the dead
men was a pyeman who was said to have fallen first and
caused the dreadful catastrophe a great number the
pupils in attendance happened to be collected in st
bartholomew's hospital at the time and afforded prompt
assistance and dr powell and a surgeon who were both
upon the spot directed their humane exertions
in the old bailey stood sydneyhouse known by the white front and the
recess in which it is concealed and here jonathan wild is said to have
lived the greatest part his time the north side newgate consists
 two courtyards which are far too circumscribed for the numerous
inhabitants this prison always exhibiting a multitudinous calendar 
human depravity the men's court is only feet inches by feet 
and the women's the same length and about half the width the whole
square is entirely surrounded by the wards which rise three
stories above the pavement the women's yard is separated from the
men's by a wall in the south and southeast yards felons for trial are
confined and four other yards are similarly occupied the yard assigned
to female felons is a wretched place containing three wards in which
are sometimes kept upwards one hundred women in the northeast
corner next newgatestreet is the condemned yard in which are
kept persons under sentence death the yards and all the wards are
repeatedly limewashed and by these and other excellent regulations
 the sheriffs london newgate is changed from a loathsome prison
dangerous to the health the metropolis to a state which maybe
quoted as a model for all similar places water is plentiful
ventilators are introduced into every window and a general system 
cleanliness prevails throughout the whole prison the morals its
inmates have been improved and their condition greatly meliorated
by mrs elizabeth fry who like her predecessor in the exercise 
philanthropy the celebrated howard delights in reducing the sum
 human misery the feelings the two visitors having been
amply gratified by demonstration the happy result from superior
management accruing to the prisoners they departed not forgetting
the poor box put up for general benefit inviting the contributions 
charitable strangers
continuing their route our perambulators proceeded down skinner street
into lowborn and traversed its extended line without any remarkable
occurrence until they reached broad street st giles's we are now
said dashall in the holy land
long life to your honors exclaimed a ragged professor mendicity
give a poor fellow the price a shake down and may you never be
without the comforts an upright 
what mean you asked the squire by a shake down and an upright
not the worse luck that you don't know that self same thing now but
sure enough a shakedown is a twopenny layer straw and saving the
tatters on my back not a covering at all at all may the son my
father never have a worse birth any how
and an upright
 is it an upright your honor's speaking about fait and troth as
to that same may the devil fly away with thady o'flannagan and that is
myself sure if he knows much about it at all at all seeing as how he
has not rested his old bones on such a thing array these many long
years but sure enough it is four stumps with boards across a good
flockbed a blanket below and a sheet above with a decent coverlet
pieced and patched in a hundred places to boot may you never want the
like it any how
thanks for your good wishes my friend said dashall and this for
the information which you have given us
by the powers good luck exclaimed the itinerant philosopher a
tirteener now an irishman's blessing upon you for two goodhearted
gentlemen may you live all the days your lives in peace and
prosperity both here and hereafter
 the many impoverished and deserted beings who daily wander
the streets trusting for the vegetative existence the
moment to eleemosynary occurrences are incalculable
amongst these sons and daughters misery happy is the one
who after partially satisfying the cravings hunger
possesses twopence the price a shake down for the
night in bainbridge or beveridgestreet st giles's the
upright is a wretched semblance a bed at the rate 
threepence or fourpence but the lofty aspirant to genteel
accommodation must put down a tester in this way there are
frequently beds to the number seventy in one house made
up for nocturnal visitants
palestine in london or the holy land includes that portion the
parish st giles bloomsbury inhabited by the lower irish with whom
it seems a favorite place residence the squire having expressed to
his friend a desire perambulating these boundaries they proceeded
by the way george street to explore the sanctified labyrinths the
scenes diurnal clamour and hebdomadary conflict
arrah now exclaimed a voice maternity in the person a
legitimate daughter erin arrah now you brat the devil's own
begetting be after bowling along to your fader bad luck to him and be
sure that you bring him home wit you by the token that the murphies are
cracking the saltherrings scalding and the appledumplings tumbling
about the pot d'ye mind me you ties the world tell him that his
dinner waits upon him i'll be after doing that same modern
and forth from the ground floor a mean looking house in
beveridgestreet sprang an urchin without hat shoe or stocking and
the scanty tattered habiliment he wore fluttering in various
hues like pennants in the wind with such heedless velocity urged no
doubt by the anticipated delicacies the dinnerpot that he came in
furious unexpected and irresistible contact with squire tallyhoho who
borne forward by the shock was precipitated into a stagnant collection
 mud and water to the total disfigurement his boots which had
that morning received the matchlessly brilliant polish warren's
inestimable jet blacking not like many others in london who will
run you down and leave you to your fate the heir his fader's
whimsicalities stopped short in the inauspicious setout his rapid
career and dirty he exclaimed to the scavenger that didn't
think the gentleman's boots and at the same time the mother this
hopeful representative the mac dermott family made her appearance
with the genuine warmth irish hospitality and inviting the two
strangers to walk in consoled the bespattered squire with the prospect
 speedy and effectual reparation for fait and troth said she his
dinner is all a heap in the pot there parties saltherrings and
appledumplings and that is my husband thady mac dermott who is
neither more nor less than a bricklayer's laborer is after amusing
himself and obliging his neighbours at a small outlay a sunday
morning by cleaning their boots and shoes so it is an ill wind that
blows nobody good they say the accommodating hostess then producing
a bottle blacking with the requisite brushing implements applied
herself assiduously to the operation cleaning the squire's boots
and restored them in a few minutes to the splendour their pristine
brilliancy
scarcely had this important operation been performed when entered thady
mac dermott and his son the origin the accident the devil burn
your trampers you imp the mac dermotts cried the father couldn't
you run against the gentleman without dirtying his boots never mind it
at all at all i'll be after giving you a walloping for it any how
 the fastidious delicacy english cookery when
contrasted with that irish culinary preparation in the
holyland is surprising the wife an irish laborer who
is desirous giving her husband a delectable meal and 
various description borders not her brain with a diversity
 utensils but from the same pot or pan will produce as
if by enchantment potatoes without which an irishman
cannot possibly make a dinner saltherrings and appledumplings
nor does this extraordinary union opposites
affect the appetite those partaking the olio
 the first instrument attack that comes to hand is an
irishman's weapon thady brandished in terrorem a red hot poker and
his son with the agility a cat took sanctuary under the bed but at
the intercession the squire was allowed to emerge with impunity and
admitted to a participation the saltherrings and appledumplings
the two friends declining an invitation to taste these dainties
now departed tallyhoho not forgetting the outlay and the illwind that
blows nobody good
winding the mazes the holy land which may not unaptly be considered
a colony irish emigrants our perambulators without further
occurrence worthy notice threaded their way through streets lanes
and alleys until they emerged at the bottom tottenhamcourt road
close by the extensive brewery read and co entering the premises
they were gratified with a view every thing interesting in the
establishment and the squire to whom the spectacle was entirely new
stood wrapt in wonder at the vast magnitude its immense vats
and boilers containing as he observed the fluid sir john
barleycorn a sufficiency to inundate the whole neighbourhood such a
circumstance said the attendant actually occurred a few years
ago when the vat burst and an ocean beer rushed forth with such
impetuous force as to bear down in its resistless progress the side 
a house and fill to the imminent hazard drowning the astonished and
alarmed occupants all the cellars in the vicinity
 scarcely into quick circulation harmony and
hilarity prevailed and the poet availing himself the moments 
inspiration gave the following chant extempore 
song
air here's to the maiden bashful fifteen
here's to the land where fair freedom is seen
old england her glory and trade aye

this complimentary bagappelle was well received and sir felix
shaking the amateur cordially by the hand observed that amongst other
attainments before he left london he meant to acquire the art making
verses when he should give the poet a rowland for his oliver
the player having but recently returned to town after completing his
engagements with some the irish provincial theatres proceeded to
amuse his auditory the baronet excepted with accounts the manner 
posting in the sister kingdom

chaise i was surprised to hear the driver knocking at each side the
carriage what are you doing an't i nailing your honor why do

and shoulders out could get no farther and called again to the
postillion augh did any one ever see any one get out a clay head
foremost can't your honor put out your feet first like a christian
here the baronet manifested considerable impatience and was about
to interrupt the narrator when the latter requesting permission
continued
next day four horses were attached to the crazy vehicle one
unfortunately lost a shoe and as i refused to go on until the
poor animal was shod my two postillions commenced in my hearing a
colloquy paddy where will i get a shoe and no smith nigh
hand why don't you see yon gentleman's horse in the field can't you
go and unshoe him true for ye said jem but that horse's shoe
will never fit him augh you can but try it said paddy so the
gentleman's horse was actually unshod and his shoe put upon the posting
hack and fit or not fit paddy went off with it
 same day during a violent storm wind and rain found that
two the windows were broken and two could not by force or art 
man be pulled up i ventured to complain to paddy the inconvenience
i suffered from the storm pelting in my face his consolation was
augh god bless your honour and can't you get out and set behind the
carriage and you'll not get a drop at all i'll engage
the player having thus closed his narrative and the laughter the
company having subsided the baronet very candidly admitted that the
sister kingdom in many parts was miserably deficient in the requisites
 travelling and other conveniences to which the english were
accustomed but in process time he continued we shall get more
civilized nevertheless we have still an advantage over you we have
more hospitality and more honesty nay by the powers but it is so my
good friends however much we unhappily may quarrel with each other we
respect the stranger who comes to sojourn amongst us and long would he
reside even in the province munster before a dirty spalpeen would
rob him his great coat and umbrella and be after doing that same
thing when he was at a friend's house too from which they were taken
along with nearly all the great coats cloaks shawls pelisses hats
and umbrellas belonging to the company
 we are inclined to believe that sir felix alludes to the
following instance daring depredation
extraordinary robbery on thursday night whilst a large party young
folks were assembled at the house mr gregory in hertford street
fitzroy square to supper a young man was let in by a servant who said
he had brought a cloak for his young mistress as the night was cold
the servant left him in the hall and went up stairs when shortly
after a second arrived with a hackney coach and on his being
questioned by the servant he said he brought the coach to take his
master and mistress home the servant was not acquainted with the names
 half the company and therefore credited what was told her the two
strangers were suffered to stand at the stairs head to listen to the
music and singing with which they appeared highly delighted and
also had their supper and plenty to drink but while festive hilarity
prevailed above the villains began to exercise their calling below and
the supper table in a trice they unloaded four silver table spoons
a silver sauceboat knives and forks c and from off the pegs and
banisters they stole eight topcoats several cloaks shawls pelisses
and hats besides a number umbrellas muffs tippets and other
articles all which they carried off in the coach which was in
waiting to complete the farce the watchman shut the coach door and
wished their honours good night the robbery was not discovered until
the company was breaking up no trace the thieves can be found
 there was certainly somewhat an irishism in the baronet's
remark eight great coats stolen the thieves could not discriminate
who were the respective owners and if it had been possible that they
could have discriminated it is not likely that any regard for the laws
 hospitality would have induced them to make an exception sir felix
o'o'grady's property amidst the general depredation
the company although secretly amused by the baronet's remarks condoled
with him on the loss he had sustained and the player protesting that
in stating the facts irish posting he had no intention giving the
baronet the least offence unanimity was restored and the conviviality
 the evening proceeded without further interruption
sir felix made irish bulls anding to the jolly deity the ancients in frequent and powerful
libations
by some unaccountable means the daemon discord however gained
admission and ascendancy
a scene now took place which baffles every attempt at description the
row became general decanters glasses and other fragile missiles
were resorted to their fragments strewed the floor and the terrified
attendants hastened to require the interposition the guardians the
night in restoring order and tranquillity
amidst the ravage and dissonance war our trio preserved a strict
neutrality and before the arrival the mediating powers had regained
their position in the piazzas where they waited the result the
conflict
negotiations peace having been unavailingly attempted the refractory
combatants were taken into custody after an obstinate resistance and
conducted to duress vile in the watchhouse
 the tragicomedy was decently wound up by one the performers
a native the emerald isle who thinking it necessary that the
neighbourhood should have an intimation the proceedings announced
the hour past three with the accompaniment a bloody
morning
the neutrals now proceeded to their respective homes and our two
associates reached their domicile without the occurrence further
incident
next morning the indicative double rittat the postman induced the
squire from the breakfastparlor to the hall the servant had opened
the door and received the letters when an itinerant dealer in genuine
articles obtruded himself on the threshold and doffing his castor after
the manner a knowing one enquired whether his honor was pleased to
be spoke with tallyhoho desired him to step in and required to know
his business the fellow with a significant wink and many prelusive
apologies for the liberty he was about to take stated that he had
accidentally come into possession some contraband goods chiefly
hollands geneva and india silk handkerchiefs prime and
indisputable excellence which he could part with at unparalleled low
prices that he had already in this private way disposed the
greatest portion and that if his honor was inclined to become
a purchaser he now had the opportunity blending economy with
superlative excellence in an almost incredible degree and unequalled
in any part the three kingdoms
this flourish the squire answered with becoming indignity expressed his
surprise at the consummate assurance any trickster who would dare
to offer him a contraband article to the prejudice his majesty's
revenue and ordered the servant to turn the scoundrel out 
doors
 the above mentioned fracas took place a few weeks ago
the offenders against the peace our sovereign lord the
king were next day held before one the police
magistrates when it appearing that the row occurred under
the influence ebriety and that the landlord and the
watchmen were the only sufferers a compromise was
permitted and the parties were discharged with a suitable
admonition
 contraband articles the squire apparently was not
aware that the superlatively excellent hollands geneva and
indiahandkerchiefs were the one the manufacture 
spitalfields and the other the sophisticated balderdash
known by the name maidstone gin it is a fact altho not
generally known that at the different watering places every
season the venders silk handkerchiefs manufactured in
spitalfields carry on a lucrative trade by disposing 
them under the affectation secrecy as the genuine
produce the indian loom and thus accommodating
themselves to the prejudice their customers against our
native productions get off in threefold proportion the
number sold in london and at a cent per cent greater
advantage
with respect to alleged contraband spirits the deceit is
more successfully manoeuvred in town than in the country
the facility smuggling on the coast frequently supplies
the maritime visitant with a cheap and genuine beverage in
town the same opportunity does not occur and on the
uninitiated in the cheats london the system this
species imposition is more frequently practised
professing to exhibit real life in london we shall not
trouble our readers with an apology for the introduction 
the following appropriate incident
court ok requests lowborn a case rather a curious
nature and which was characterised rather by the absurd
credulity the parties than by its novelty came before
the commissioners on thursday last a man the name 
o'regan attended the court to show cause against a summons
which had been issued calling upon him to pay a debt 
eighteen shillings which was alleged to be due by him to a
person who stated his name to be higgins the parties were
both irishmen and exhibited a good deal irritation as
well as confusion in their stories with some difficulty
the following facts were collected from their respective
statements on tuesday week about nine o'clock in the
evening a man dressed in the costume a sailor and
wearing a large rough coat similar to that commonly worn by
seafaring men in bad weather entered the shop o'regan
who is a dealer in salt fish and other haberdashery as he
called it in st giles's and beckoning to the back part 
the room and at the same time looking very significantly
said may be you would not like a drop the real thing
to keep a merry christmas with what do you mane says
o'regan whiskey to be sure says the man faith and
it's i that would replied o'regan provided it was good
and chape och by the piper bulrush says the man
there has not been a note cleaner more completer drop 
putshean whiskey illicitly distilled smuggled across
the herringbrook the irish channel for many a long
day and as for shapeless you shall have it for an ould
song you don't mane to say it's after being smuggled
says o'regan be my soul but i do rejoined the manit's
i and jack corcoran a friend mine brought it safe
and sound into the thames last sunday in the shape a
cargo butterfirkins from cork could a body taste
itpursued o'regan with a couple why not says the
man i've a blather full it under my other his armpit
if you'll lind us hould a glass o'regan said he
hadn't a glass handy but he brought a cup and the bladder
being produced a fair taste was poured forth which
o'regan having tippled it off after collecting his breath
swore was the darling a drop it was the next kin to
aquafortis aqua fifties you mane says the man
aquafortis is a fool to it the next question was as to
the priceoch by the powers says the honest smuggler
as you're a countryman and friend you shall have it for
ten shillings a gallon and less than that i wouldn't give
it to my mother o'regan thought this too much and
proposed eight shillings a gallon but after much
chartering he agreed to give nine shillings the quantity
was next discussed the man could not sell less than an
anger four gallons this was too much for o'regan but he
finally determined to get a friend to go partners and
higgins who lodged in his house was called down and also
indulged with a taste which he likewise pronounced
beautiful it was then arranged with strong injunctions
 secrecy that the tub should be brought the next night
in a halfbushel sack as if it were coals and the hour 
nine was appointed thor the
day to their request
 have you breakfasted asked dashall whether or not answered
sir felix i'll take a cup taa with you any how
when the repast was finished the triumvirate set out on their
pedestrian excursion interrupted however in their progress by a
temporary shower they took refuge in a coffeehouse where sir felix
taking up a newspaper read from amongst the numerous advertisements
the following selected article information convenient
accommodations for ladies who are desirous privately lying in
and their infants carefully put out to nurse well now after all
observed the baronet this same london is a very convenient place
where a lady may gratify her pleasurable propensities and at same time
preserve an unblemished reputation it is only going into the country
sure for the benefit her health that is to say she retires to one
 the villages in the neighbourhood london pays her way without
name given or questions asked and in a few months returns to town
improved in health but more slender in person all her acquaintance
exclaiming la my dear how vastly thin you have grown
there are in london and its neighbourhood said dashall numerous
such convenient asylums but i cannot acquiesce in their utility i
am rather opinion that they have a demoralizing tendency as
accelerating by concealment the progress licentiousness human
failings will still predominate and the indulgence illicit
intercourse is less frequently prevented by an innate principle
 virtue than the dread shame when facility concealment is
therefore given to the result these connexions will still become more
prevalent
by the powers exclaimed sir felix but i think morality ought to
feel particularly benefited by these convenient asylums they preserve
reputation and in some instances have prevented suicide and murder i
know two cases wherein both crimes were perpetrated through a sense
 shame and dread discovery which probably would not have
happened could the unfortunates have resorted to convenient
accommodations well here's good luck to the fair sex the dear
creatures and may they every one them die on a christmas day any
how
 this eccentric wish elicited a look surprise from the squire
which sir felix observing
my reason is said he that the gates heaven being open all that
day long a body may slip in unknown as it is to be hoped that you
mr dashall and i may do some day shortly without any interruption at
all at all
this ludicrous finis excited the laughter the company
but lo the clouds break off and sideways run
out from his shelter lively looks the sun
and the united observers real life hailing the favorable presage
resumed their perambulation
advancing along piccadilly towards hyde park they reached the splendid
mansion the hero waterloo the gates were open and a travelling
carriage with four horses was in waiting for his grace who was then
about setting off to inspect the fortifications the netherlands
neither sir felix nor tallyhoho having ever seen the duke the triumvirate
paused at the entrance the courtyard until the carriage came forth
when they saluted the gallant warrior with the tribute respect due
to distinguished services and exalted genius which his grace very
courteously returned
 on the subject convenient accommodation for ladies
who wish privately to ly in if we might hazard an opinion
it would be in coincidence with that our friend dashall
these establishments are certainly an encouragement to
licentiousness and it is well known that in many these
receptacles where the strictest honor and secrecy may be
relied on the allurement abortion is held out to the
unhappy female if she declines the anticipation maternal
solicitude
 thirtytwo great personages anecdote the duke 
wellington his grace the duke wellington when last in
the netherlands and travelling without attendants in a
part the country where his multitudinous titles were not
well understood was overtaken on the road by a veteran
officer whose route lay in the same direction with that 
his grace the duke having occasion to stop and as the
officer would reach a certain town several hours before him
he requested that the veteran would take the trouble 
ordering dinner for him at the principal inn the old
officer made his conger and proneeded on his mission i
am desired to order dinner here said he to the landlord
but stay i had better state who for then calling for
pen and ink he presented the astonished and delighted host
with the following list his forthcoming illustrious
guests
the prince waterloo
the duke wellington the duke ciudad rodrigo
and the duke victoria
the marquis douro and a marshal general france
master general the ordnance
colonel the royal rest horse guards blue
colonel the rifle brigade
the lord lieutenant hampshire and
the governor plymouth
field marshal austria
russia
prussia
france
england and
the netherlands
a grandee the highest class
a captain general spain
knights the orders 
the garter in england st andrew in russia the black
eagle in russia charles iii in spain st ferdinand and
merit in spain the golden fleece in spain maximilian
joseph in bavaria st maria theresa in austria the
sword in spain st esprit in france st george in
russia the tower and sword in portugal
and to bring up the rear
a doctor civil laws
mon dieu exclaimed the host in extacy what a noble
company he then began to tell them over one prince
he continued three dukes one marquis a marshal general
 france an english governor an english lord lieutenant
the master general the ordnance and two english
colonels six field marshals one grandee the highest
class a captain general spain twelve knights and a
doctor civil laws mon dieu thirtytwo great
personages
all the provisions the town all the delicacies the
season and all the celebrated wines were immediately put in
requisition for the illustrious company in expectancy
at last the duke wellington arrived and was ushered into
a spacious diningroom where a cloth was laid with thirtytwo
covers the person the duke was unknown to the
innkeeper who full important preparations for the
thirtytwo great personages thought not any thing
else i ordered dinner here said his grace mon
dieu responded the innkeeper are you one the thirtytwo
great personages presenting the list at same time his
grace glanced his eye over it they are all here said
he so send up the dinner immediately the innkeeper
stood aghast with amazement at last finding utterance he
ventured to express a hope that his grace would be pleased
to take into consideration that he the innkeeper had at
great trouble and expence provided a most sumptuous
entertainment for thirtytwo great personages d n
the thirtytwo great personages exclaimed the duke send
up the dinner and your bill thus i must pay the penalty
said he for not having invited the old veteran to be 
the party
 the squire observed that the brilliant victories his grace
although acknowledged and rewarded by all the potentates europe had
not procured him much popularity at home the remark was confessed by
dashall to be correct but whence the public indifference originated he
could not presume to explain
crossing hyde park which a celebrated physician denominated the lungs
 the metropolis our pedestrians made their egress into oxfordroad
this fine street with longitudinal reference the first in london
excited the admiration the baronet the long line perspective
indeterminable to the view stretching from hyde park corner to st
giles's the general uniformity the buildings the neatness and in
many instances the splendor the tradesmen's shops together with the
comfortable manner their perambulation jostled and unimpeded by
the hurry throng and bustle passengers with which many other
parts the town are annoyed gave an additional zest enjoyment to
the trio in their excursion while the squire observed that he felt in
this part the town always as if he had been suddenly removed to
some other region the world far remote from the city london its
dissonant uproar and crowded inconveniences
turning into blenheim street dashall apprized his companions that if
they felt inclined to take a peep into the theatre anatomy he could
procure their admission
the squire seemed to recoil from so disgusting an exhibition while
on the other hand the baronet expressed a great desire to enter the
theatre i have been used to murder and mutilation said he
the devil you have ejaculated the squire where how
where else should it be but in ireland replied the baronet and as
to the how was it not sure after the manner my profession while i
was a member a corps yeoman cavalry during the rebellion when we
whipped hanged beheaded and mutilated men every day by dozens so
you may guess my good friend that cutting up a human carcase
is nothing new to me only now i should like to see if there is any
difference in the mangling human bodies by the anatomical artists
 london from the cidevant military professors the loyal troop 
doneraile
the hesitation manifested by the squire yielded ultimately to the
importunity the baronet and they entered the human shambles where
the cutters up were at work upon a subject securing to themselves the
advantage personal experience in the process dissection the
abdomen had been already cleared out and the corpse was portioned out
to the different students anatomy for the purpose illustration
the arms to one class the legs to another the head to a third c so
that in less than a quarter an hour decapitation and dismemberment
were completely effected and the trunk was deserted as an
uninteresting object from which there could not be derived any
information importance further than that which the students had
already obtained
sir felix whispered his friends that these adepts in human mutilation
far exceeded in apathy feeling and adroitness execution even the
cidevant loyal troop doneraile but when one the young artists
brought forward in his hands smeared with gore a human heart for the
operation the dissecting knife tallyhoho declaring that he could bear
it no longer rushed out the theatre and was followed by his two
companions all disgusted with this spoliation the dead however
conducive it might prove to the interests the living
 the human subjects for these theatres anatomy and
private dissection are chiefly supplied by
resurrectionists a class depraved wretches whose only
employment is that bodysnatching or robbing the graves
 their dead from which they derive a ready and lucrative
emolument the anatomists are ready at all hours to receive
without questions asked and with prompt remuneration the
produce these unsanctified depredations dreadful must
be the feelings the fond relatives a departed friend
to learn that the sanctuary the grave has been violated
and the body perhaps a beloved wife sister or other
revered female exposed to the gaze and subjected to the
scalpingknife these butchers
iron coffins have been resorted to as a safeguard which
once closed cannot be opened for this improvement the
artist obtained a patent but he is not likely to derive
much advantage from his invention as the parish officers
within the bills mortality have generally refused the
rites sepulture to bodies cased in iron alleging that
the almost imperishable material would shortly compel an
enlargement burying ground at a vast expence which it
is the duty the parish officers to prevent by resisting
the interment bodies in iron coffins and this resolution
has lately had the sanction legal authority

proceeding along oxford street sir felix enquired for the holy land 
informing his friends at same time that his servant whom he had
entrusted the preceding day with a cheque on his banker had not been
at home all night and the probability was that he had got amongst
his munster friends in palestine sir felix was therefore desirous 
ascertaining if possible the sanctuary the fugitive and with
that view requested his friends to accompany him in a perambulation 
discovery through to him these hitherto unexplored regions this
application was readily assented to and the triumvirate passed onwards
to the place destination
they had now reached the church st giles in the fields situated in
broad street st giles's and their attention was immediately directed
to that fine piece sculpture over the iron gateway leading into
the churchyard representing the resurrection and last judgment the
figures are in basso relievo and although diminutive are admirably
grouped and the expression each gives to the whole a finished and
impressive effect
two minutes more and the three friends were on the boundaries the
holy land namely george street or as formerly cognomen dyott
street bloomsbury
at the this street next to st giles's were several the
lower irish both gender who clustering together seemed to hold
a close confabulation casting occasionally an inquisitive eye on sir
felix o'o'grady
by the soul the priest at last exclaimed one the munster
pedigrees but it is him and i would take my davy on it but sure
enough i will ax the gentleman himself now whether he knows who he is
or if he is any body at all at all
this real representative the tagrag and bobtail the emerald
isle was arrayed in the appropriate costume his class and country
a nameless something that had once been a hat covered a shock head 
hair the redundancy which protuberant sideways and perpendicularly
from the cidevant castor in many a knotty combination
impervious to wind and weather the fragments a loose great coat
decorated his tall athletic form which scarcely reaching his knees
exposed fully to observation his nether habiliment
his galligaskins that had long withstood
the winter's fury and encroaching frost
by time subdued what will not time subdue
now horrid rents disclosed portending agues
his brawny legs were partially cased in worsted hose the dilapidation
 wear and tear ingeniously repaired with cloth pieced and patched
and comprising all the prismatic colours the rainbow his toes
disdaining the trammels duress peeped through his brogues as if
anxious for freedom and to complete the singularity this strange
figure his vacant face was incrusted with filth his bristly beard
unshorn
and stuck in his mouth capacious dimensions
that never to similar shape had prate
captivates
we are on a shopping expedition replied one the ladies you
and your friend melvillehall are observers life in london
generally ours is a mere circumscribed sphere action we go to
view life in a mercer's shop when the squire and you are not more
pleasantly engaged give us a call and perhaps we may grant you the
honor an interview we would ask the unknown said she in a
whisper who is he
 a thief from habit not long since there existed in
the fashionable world a female rank and property who
was an habitual expert and incorrigible thief she would
frequently sally forth in her carriage and alighting at the
doors perhaps half a dozen different tradesmen rummage
over their goods without makking a purchase and embrace
the opportunity purloining any portable article that lay
in her way those tradesmen to whom her thieving
propensities were known used to watch carefully her
manoeuvres let her walk off with the spoil and then send a
bill depredation which she uniformly and without
hesitation discharged this unfortunate woman was one
morning detected in the shop a mercer to whom she was a
stranger in the act pilfering some article value he
was about to detain her when she burst into an agony 
tears acknowledged and lamented deeply the irresistible
infatuation under which she acted disclosed her rank and
family and the compassionate mercer suffered her to depart
at another time being one a cardparty a gold snuffbox
vanished from the table every person present denied any
knowledge it madam you are mistaken said one the
company you have got the snuffbox in your pocket how
very absent i amexclaimed our heroine producing the
box and i beg that you will continue absent said the
lady the mansion
 sir felix o'o'grady madam answered dashall an irish baronet
 recent acquaintance like every other gentleman the emerald isle
combining with characteristic eccentricity a sound head and a warm
heart
then all things bring him with you so waving gracefully her
hand adieu the trio responded by respectfully raising their hats
allons donc she exclaimed and the carriage drove off
there go exclaimed dashall two the most lovely and accomplished
women in london and perhaps the least tinctured with fashionable
folly
with the exception observed the squire shopping that is i
presume making the morning tour tradesmen's shops tumbling over
their goods giving them every possible trouble and ultimately making
no purchase
dashall admitted the correctness the squire's observation as
generally applicable but claimed an exemption for the ladies in
question
on the left proceeding down chancery lane dashall pointed to a
respectable house as the occasional residence a lady in the first
class literature whose writings have given universal satisfaction
and will continue to be read with increased avidity as conveying the
most admirable lessons morality told in a manner alike impressive
and pathetic mrs ope the widow the late celebrated artist this
excellent woman is endeared to the circle her numerous acquaintance
by a preeminent
 tallyhoho had improved in his knowledge real life in
london his definition shopping was perfectly correct
one those fashionable female idlers who delight in
occupying the time and exercising the patience the
industrious alighted a short time since at the shop a
tradesman in ludgatestreet and after a couple hours
spent in examining and reexamining a variety rich silks
made her election at last and desired the mercer to cut her
off a shilling's worth throwing at the same time the
money on the counter the tradesman with perfect coolness
took up the piece coin laid it on a corner the silk
circumscribed it with his scissors and presented the part
so cut out to the lady as the shilling's worth required we
feel pleasure in recording the result the lady admired the
mercer's equanimity temper laughed heartily at his
manner illustrating it and in atonement for trouble
given and patience exemplified became and still continues
one his most valued customers
 suavity disposition blended with superior mental endowments
to the unfortunate by her benevolent heart to which the appeal 
distress is never made in vain and to the public generally by her
invaluable works the uniform tendency which is the advancement 
virtue and the inculcation the benign feelings humanity
 to the admirers mrs ope the following lines never
before published will not prove unacceptable
tribute respect
o thou matchless power to raise
and bend the passions to thy sway i
whose pen with magic force portrays
whose spell the shadowy forms obey
 joy and grief hope and fear
and wiles from apathy a tear
enchantress take the duteous lays
to worth that admiration pays
to thee as to thy ope given
on immortality a claim
his virtues pass'd from earth to heaven
yet still exist in deathless fame
his pencil to thy pen assign'd
to charm instruct and grace mankind
and oh could but my humble strains
to thy impressive skill aspire
the muse that faintly now sustains
thy worth would make poetic fire
and glowing high with fervid name
would graft her honors on thy name
but ah bereft every stay
from hope exil'd with woe i keep
my vigils each sad sorrowing day
and wake each dreary night to weep
by penury chill'd poetic powers
no voice to soothe no hand to save
and snatch a victim from the grave
around me desolation lours
and glaring midst the deep'ning gloom
despair and famine urge me to the tomb
if all unmeet my humble strain
is destin'd still to flow in vain
shouldst thou the tribute now refuse
essayed by misery and the muse
reject not yet the lay with scorn
to thee by kindred feelings borne
for still thy tales plaintive tone
breathe pain and sufferings like mine own
 facing the entrance to the royal wax works sir felix made a full
stop that fellow said he alluding to the whole length figure 
the sentinel stands as motionless as a statue by the powers but
halfadozen peepoday boys in his rear would be after putting life and
mettle in his heels shoulder and carry your arms you spalpeen and
is this the way that you show the position a soldier at same time
enforcing his admonition with a smart stroke his cane over the arm
 the inanimate military representative the attendant a young man
in the costume the yeomen the guards remonstrated dashall and
tallyhoho laughed most immoderately and the baronet equally enjoying the
joke persisted in affecting to believe that he was addressing himself
to a living object greatly to the amusement the now congregating
street passengers
begging your pardon ray jewel continued sir felix long life and
good luck to you in your stationary quarters and may his majesty never
find a more active enemy than yourself by the soul my grandmother
it would be well for poor ireland who has taken leave her senses if
her bogtrotting marauders were as peaceably inclined as you are fait
and troth but you're a fine looking lad after all and with the
assistance your master and a touch prometheus we might raise
a regiment braver fellows than the king's guards without bounty or
beat drum in the twinkling an eye honey but with your leave
and saving yourself unnecessary trouble we'll be after paying a visit
to the company above stairs and the party proceeded to the exhibition
room
here were representatives the living and mementos the dead kings
and queens princes and princesses
ah cease the sad resemblance here
thee then to every feeling dear
 tender sympathy thy way
illumin'd to life's remotest day
in bliss in worth in talent shine
though pain and want succoured mine
adorning this terrestrial sphere
be long an ope's talents given
and virtue consecrate the tear
when call'd to join her native heaven
a k
 warriors statesmen poets and philosophers in social
communion not forgetting the lady who had three hundred and sixtyfive
children at a birth
the baronet made many confess to the great and inferior personages by
whom he was surrounded admired the heterogeneity the group and
regretted that their imperfect creation precluded the possibility 
converse
one the figures by an unobserved excitement the attendant
now inclined its head to sir felix who nothing daunted immediately
assumed the attitude macbeth in the banquet scene and exclaimed
nay if thou canst nod speak too if our graves and charnel houses
give those we bury back our monuments shall be the maws kites
the company present pronounced the baronet a player and a lady to whom
the manly and athletic form the supposed tragedian had given apparent
pleasure assured him she had never heard the passage more impressively
delivered and that certainly in the character the scottish usurper
there was no doubt his becoming to mr ran a very formidable rival
sir felix sustained his part admirably expressing his high
acknowledgment the lady's favorable opinion but the enquiry when and
in which theatre he meant to make his first appearance had so nearly
deranged his gravity and that his two friends as to induce them to
hasten their retreat
dashall and tallyhoho congratulated the baronet on his promising dramatic
talent and advised him still further to court the favors the tragic
muse
may the devil burn the tragic muse he exclaimed
 thus runs the legend
a lady in former times who it seems like some our
modern visionaries was an enemy to superabundant
population and would have restricted the procreation 
children to those only who could maintain them was applied
to for alms by a poor woman with no less than five little
famishing urchins in her train the haughty dame not only
refused to relieve the unfortunate mendicant but poured
upon her a torrent abuse adding that she had no right to
put herself in the way having children whom she could not
support the woman dropped on her knees and prayed that
the lady might have as many children at one birth as there
were days in the year and so as the legend runs it
actually happened
 arrah give me the favors that sweet pretty creature the
comical muse at the waxworks who took me for a player och the
fascination her smile and the witchery her eye before all the
muses that ever fuddled the brain a garreteer
why baronet said the squire you are lovestruck deeply
lurched taken in by the knowing one
taken in that is as it may hereafter happen but an irishman my
jewel is never so desperately in love with one girl but he can spare a
bit affection for another
sure love is the soul a nate irishman
he loves all that's lovely loves all that he can
with his sprig shilleleagh and shamrock so green
the three friends had now rounded the corner at the bottom 
fleetstreet in the direction blacksmiths when dashall claimed the
attention his associates
this is the domicil said he the patriotic alderman who during
so many years has uniformly and ably opposed the civic hirelings 
corruption advocated the cause freedom and acquired the wellearned
meed high estimation by all the respectable and independent portion
 his fellowcitizens
firm in principle and resolute in difficulty the conscientious
discharge his duty has ever been his prominent object but perhaps in
no instance has he so greatly endeared himself to humanity than in that
 the long protracted inquest on the bodies the two unfortunate
men honey and francis the victims military outrage his constant
attendance and indefatigable exertions on that occasion were the means
 eliciting many particulars which otherways might not have been known
and which ultimately led the jury to record the atrociousness the
crime by the several verdicts murder and manslaughter
again on the memorable day the funeral these two immolated men
mr w in his capacity sheriff supported with becoming dignity his
high station and undaunted amidst imminent danger enforced obedience
even from the military and saved the effusion human blood
london exhibits daily a series depravity perhaps unparalleled in
any other part the british empire
 dashall had just finished his eulogium on the worthy alderman
in which his friends heartily coincided when the attention the
triumvirate was attracted by the appalling appearance five men
rivetted together and conducted along the street by officers 
justice tallyhoho enquired into the nature their crimes and was
informed that they were in custody under suspicion housebreaking in
the nighttime and that two them particularly had been taken in
the house which they had plundered regaling themselves in perfect
ease with cold meat wine and liquors and the stolen property tied up
in a bag with which on the moment alarm they attempted an escape
but were intercepted in their retreat and taken in charge by the
officers after a desperate resistance in which shots and hurts were
received both by the victors and the vanquished it is almost beyond
belief that men engaged in an enterprise wherein ignominious death
awaits discovery would sit down to regale themselves after having
secured their booty with as much composure as if in their own homes
yet so it is such is the daring callousness mind attached to long
confirmed and successful habits guilt
 police mansion house william johnson was charged by mr
miller lower thames street on suspicion having committed
a robbery on thursday night under circumstances 
rather an extraordinary kind mr miller's evidence was to
the following effect he has a cut glass and earthenware
warehouse in thames street but does not reside there upon
visiting his warehouse yesterday morning he found that
thieves had been very busy upon the concern the night
before they did not get much but while they were in the
house they enjoyed themselves they lighted a fire and paid
a visit to the winecellar from which they took two bottles
 wine and three bottles perry which it seemed they
drank warm with sugar and mr miller received a very polite
letter from one them acknowledging the obligations they
were under to him for the excellent beverage his cellar
afforded upon examining other parts the premises mr
miller found that his iron chest had been forced open the
instrument a large chisel with which this feat was
performed was lying on the premises and a dark lanthorn
which the thieves had forgotten was also picked up in the
course the search the petty cash drawers the iron
chest lay open empty but mr miller believed there had been
in them when he left the warehouse a sum perhaps not
exceeding a couple pounds the bills and papers were not
taken away neither had any thing been removed that was
likely to be recovered some silver cruettops were taken
but the cruets were left behind the chisel which
though very strong had been broken in the effort to open
the chest was the largest size all the rooms the
building except those in front had been visited by the
depredators and there were various circumstances concurring
to fix a very strong suspicion on the prisoner besides the
probability that he was the writer the letter thanks
to mr miller for the entertainment afforded the letter
which was written in a good hand began with the word
gemmen and stated that they the writer and his friends
had called regretted that there was no tassel in the
lob money in the chest but expressed the highest
opinion the wine begged pardon for disturbing the
papers and expressed how happy those who drank the wine
would be to visit the premises upon a future occasion the
prisoner was remanded
 it sometimes happens that even juvenile depredators who have
imbibed a propensity for liquor have been caught in the snare thus
laid by themselves this fact dashall gave the following very curious
illustration a few evenings ago said he the family my next
door neighbour retired to rest leaving every thing as they imagined
in a state perfect security on the servant however coming downstairs
in the morning he was surprised to find a new and unexpected
inmate fast asleep in the kitchen a quantity plate packed up lay by
his side and before him were a bottle brandy and another wine
he was a lad not more than sixteen years age who had ingeniously
contrived in the nighttime to get access to the house and having
secured his spoil had resorted to the pantry and winecellar for
refreshment the stores from the latter receptacle he had partaken
so liberally that he was thrown into a deep slumber from which he was
roused by the unwelcome voice the officer who had been sent for to
take him into custody
our perambulators had now passed along the bridge and advanced a short
distance on blackfriar's road when they observed a spacious travelling
caravan stationary by the side the high way intimating that there
was to be seen within the great northern bear known by the name 
autocrat all the russian while a fellow with a speaking tube
invited in the most alluring terms itinerant oratory the gaping
multitude to walk in walk in ladies and gentlemen and behold
this most wonderous all wonders that ever was wondered at in this
wonderful world the ursa major that gives its name to one 
the constellations and was taken by a ruse de guerre in one the
hitherto undiscovered deserts the remotest siberia this stupendous
animal was sent from these unknown regions as a present to a certain
great personage in this country who having a superabundance native
bears already prowling about him was pleased to order the dismission
 this northern stranger without a pension and thus it came into the
possession its present exhibiter
 this irresistible invitation was accepted by several the
auditory including the baronet dashall and the squire who were
gratified beyond their anticipations with a sight the great polar
bear the desolate inhabitant a frigid and dismal clime where
nature has forbid the vegetative and stinted the growth the animal
creation with the exception the shaggy wanderer the desert
and the floundering leviathan the ocean the animal was perfectly
tractable and its exhibition well compensated both for time and
gratuity
the proprietor however in answer to an enquiry apart by dashall
acknowledged that his ursine companion had never been attached to the
household any great personage although a northern quadruped 
lesser interest was under the protection one the royal dukes and
frequently played its mischievous gambols in the environs kensington
palace
 the bear at kensington palace early on sunday mornking it
was discovered that a large black bear sent as a present
to his royal highness the duke sussex had contrived to
break out his cage which was placed in a coachhouse
and bruin having an inclination to explore these premises
containing a handsome new chariot mounted the footboard
and began to play with the tassels he next ascended the
roof and the box the covering which became a prey to his
claws after enjoying himself as an outside passenger as
long as he thought proper he proceeded to examine the
interior the vehicle and turning from the box made his
entre through the front windows into the carriage which
bore serious marks his savage curiosity no one dared to
approach this northern visitor and in order to prevent
further depredations in his probable rambles guards were
placed with fixed bayonets until some keepers arrived from
a menagerie who secured him after great difficulty in one
 their strong cages
chapter x
oh the dear pleasures the velvet plain
the painted tablets dealt and dealt again
cards with what rapture and the polish'd die
the yawning chasm indolence supply
then to the dance and make the sober moon
witness joys that shun the sight noon
blame cynic if you can quadrille or ball
the snug close party or the splendid hall
where night down stooping from her ebon throne
views constellations brighter than her own
tis innocent and harmless and refined
the balm care elysium the mind
 the rapid succession novelty in a life in london where the
scenes like those a pantomime are constantly changing
from grave to gay from lively to severe
scarcely required those attentions which the hon tom dashall continued
to enjoy on the score arrangements for the gratification and
information his cousin he was ever watchful opportunities to
furnish new views real life and character to tallyhoho and who never
failed to profit by his observations upon men and manners for tom
notwithstanding the gaiety his disposition was an acute and
discerning companion who having mingled in all ranks and degrees 
society was able to associate himself with the high or the low as
circumstances might require and to form tolerably accurate estimates 
those by whom he was surrounded
it was therefore with his usual view to the accomplishment his
cousin as a votary real life in london that he had proposed a visit
to a fancy dress ball at almack's and preparations had accordingly been
made between them
a fancy dress ball said tom in order to give his cousin an idea
 the entertainment he was to partake bears some similitude to a
masquerade with two important exceptions first masks are not general
and second no practical jokes are expected or admitted dress
however is left wholly to the taste or inclination the visitors and
the amusements consist principally dancing and cards the rooms are
 the most splendid description and the company generally the first
order combining all that is elegant and fashionable in what is termed
the higher ranks society tis said
illustration pages attacks
if once to attacks you belong
like monarchs you can do no wrong
but banish'd thence on wednesday night
and enquire how the cash moves for you
know if your aunt is losing her money she will be as cross as the 
silence charles said his sister remember you have no occasion to
make such observations here why you might almost as well entertain us
with a pedigree the family as expose the tempers and dispositions
 your relations besides i am sure the party alluded to would feel
herself very much offended to hear such conversation in a ball room
it is neither a fit time or place and with this each 
his sisters seizing an arm led him towards the card room alternately
schooling him as they passed along and leaving our heroes to draw their
own conclusions from what had occurred
thus it is said tom that a commander in the field is obliged to bean
obedient in the ball room he is however a very poor creature at the
best times and depends more upon the abilities others than his
own for the appearance he makes in the world and is rather to be looked
at than admired and esteemed here continued he i shall have an
opportunity introducing you to a character another kind here is
my friend dick distich a logger rhyme a poet and a contemplative
philosopher he is recently married but appears to be without his rib
my dear friend dashall exclaimed a tall thin man advancing and
catching him by the hand i am glad to see you for i am bewildered and
lost
good replied tom then i am very glad to have found you what is
the reward are you advertised are your manuscripts stolen or is your
library on fire has the good woman brought forth twins or disappointed
your hopes
walk this way replied the other you are a happy fellow always
gamesome and gay but i know you have a fellow feeling for all mankind
and will pour the balm pity into a wounded heart
zounds said tom you attack a body with a mouthful pity and a
heart full wounds at a strange time for the introduction such
subjects what can you mean probably you appear here as the knight 
the woeful countenance with a determination to support the character
to the the chapter why you look as melancholy as a mute and one
would almost fancy you were making a funeral visit instead attending
a mask'd
i have enough to make me so was the reply i shall be brief in my
narrative in order that i may not interfere with your enjoyments and
you know that mine are another kind i am routed from home
how do you mean
thus it is then you know i am a plain man a quiet man a civil and
humble man i hate balls and routs but my wife and i differ in taste
she has determined on having a rout at home and it proves no
misnomer with me for heaven knows they rout me from study to drawing
room from drawing room to chamber and all because truly my little
woman must have her party
and why not enquired tom
why man for this reason you must know i had myself the sweetest
little sanctuary in the world i had gothicised my study its walls
were painted in imitation oak my books were arranged with the
most authorlike neatness my prints hung my casts and models all
bracketed and all have vanished like the
baseless fabric a vision
and is this your misery said tom upon my soul i began to think you
had lost your wife but it seems you have only lost your wits what the
devil did you expect when you joined issue to live as you have done
like a hermit in a cell well if this is all i do pity you indeed
but you have not heard half yet the whole house is transformed
and i think you ought to be reformed continued tom
notwithstanding the lightness and satire with which our hero appeared to
treat the subject poor distich was not to be stayed in his course
ah said he with a sigh in vain did cicero strain his neck to
peep over burke on the sublime and beautiful shakespeare beard blair's
sermons and humphrey clinker or milton's sightless balls gleam over sir
walter scott's epics all all is chaos and misrule even my greenhouse
over my head which held three cidevant pots mignonette one decayed
myrtle a soidisant geranium and other exotic which are to spring
out afresh in the summer my shrubs are clapped under my couch and
my evergreens stuck over the kitchen fire place are doomed to this
unpropitious hotbed in order to make room for patterns clogs cloaks
and shawls for all the old maids in town
tom bit his lip to stifle a laugh and treading lightly on the toe 
his cousin had so strongly excited tallyhoho's risibility that it was
with difficulty he resisted the momentary impulse
the routed benedict continued our drawing room which
conveniently holds ten persons is to be the black hole for thirty my
study dear beloved retreat where sonnets have been composed and novels
written this spot which just holds me and my cat is to be the scene 
bagatelle commerce or any thing else that a parcel giggling girls
may chuse to act in it my statues are converted diabolic is made to
hold a spermaceti candle while the medical nymph my apollo belvedere
and my dancing fawn being too bulky to move are adorned with aprons
 green silk because forsooth betty says they are vastly indecent with
nothing on them and my wife is quite certain that no one will visit
us unless we do as other people do alas until the success my last
poem we never cared about other people and i am now absolutely turned
out to make room for them and advised to come here tonight in order
to prepare myself for the approaching festivity
dashall was unable to contain himself longer and bob who had been for
some time stuffing his white cambric handkerchief into his mouth could
no longer resist the laugh he had been trying to avoid they look'd
alternately at each other and then at the doleful complainant who with
unaltered features sat for a moment between his laughing companions
till perceiving the ridiculous situation he was in he rose from his
seat and hastily left the room
our friends then took a further survey the company without making
any additional remark except upon the view the various elegant and
tasteful dresses exhibited the grace and agility the dancers and
the brilliance the decorations when supper was announced
moving onward to the supper room they again encountered poor distich
who although he had no relish for the generality the amusements
declared he would not quit till he had supped after which tom
determined if possible to drive away the blue devils who seemed to
have occupied his brain for this purpose he listened to his additional
complaints and filling his glass at every pause became lively and
agreeable as the toast was circulated till the invigorating effects
 the bottle sunk him again and at length putting him into a hackney
coach they dispatched him in good order to his rib after which they
took their departure towards piccadilly
chapter xi
i be one they sailors who think tis no lie
that for every wherefore there should be a why
that by fortune's strange weather a calm or a squall
our births good or bad are chalked out for us all
that the stays and the braces life will be found
to be some em rotten and some em sound
thus the good we should cherish the bad never seek
for death will too soon bring each anchor apeak
it was half past eleven o'clock before our friends approaching the
breakfast parlour had an opportunity congratulating each other on
the amusements the previous evening when the hon tom dashall ever
upon the active lookout for the most pleasurable amusements to occupy
the mind and attention his cousin observing it was a very tine
morning proposed a ride to greenwich and with this object in view all
being prepared it was not long before they were sell in a breath whose invitation dashall took not any notice i
hate importunity he observed to his friend passing towards the stairs
he was silently but respectfully saluted by a modest looking young man
without the obtrusive offer service trim your boat my lad
this was the business a moment now pull away and land us at the
shades elysium said the squire terminating the instructions
rather abruptly the amphibious conveyancer i am rather at a loss
to know said the waterman where that place is but if your honors
incline to the shades at london bridge i'll row you there in the
twirling a mopstick the very spot said dashall and the
waterman doffing his jacket and encouraged to freedom by the familiar
manner the two strangers plied his oars lustily humming in
cadence the old song
i was d'ye see a waterman
as tight and blythe as any
twixt chelsea town and horseydown
i gain'd an honest penny
they now glided pleasantly on the serene bosom the thames and
enjoyed in mute admiration the beauties a variegated prospect
which if equalled is at least not excelled by any other in the
universe on either side this noble river a dense mass buildings
presented itself to the eye and as the buoyant vehicle proceeded
the interest the varying scene increased in progressive proportion
thousands barges skirted the margin the lordly stream and seemed
like dependant vassals whose creation and existence were derived from
and sustained by the fiat old father thames and imagination might
well pourtray the figure the venerable parent this magnificent
stream regulating its rippling wave and riding in the triumph regal
sway over his spacious domains the grandeur the public edifices
on the left the numerous indications art on the right the active
industry on both sides and the fairylike boats pleasurable
conveyance gliding to and fro and shooting in the distance through
one or other the lofty arches waterloo bridge produced an effect
imposingly grand and was dwelt upon by our hero belville hall
particularly with mingled sensations surprise admiration and
delight
silence had prevailed for some time with the exception the waterman
who now and then carroll a stanza responsive to the stroke the oar
when the attention his fare was drawn towards him
you seem to enjoy a merry life my good friend said the squire
ay ay your honour god bless you why should not i at my poor home
and your honour knows that the cottage the peasant is equally dear to
him as is the palace to the prince there is my old woman with her five
little ones all looking forward to the happiness seeing me in the
evening after the labours the day and to feel that one is cared
for by somebody is a sweet consolation amidst all our toils besides
your honour the old times are partly come round again halfacrown
will go farther aye thricetold now than it did a few years
ago then hang sorrow i am a contented waterman your honour sod
n the pope long life to king george the fourth and success to
the land that we live in here said dashall is an heterogeneous
mixture prejudice simplicity and good nature
you are but a young man and cannot long have followed your present
profession is it from choice that you continue it
why your honour i served an apprenticeship to it am not long out
 my time and continue it as well from choice as necessity the first
because i like it and lastly as our parson says because in any other
situation i could serve neither my neighbour nor myself
by this time the tiny bark had shot the centre arch waterloo and new
scenes interest presented themselves in evervarying succession as
they proceeded towards blacksmiths somerset house wore particularly
an aspect great and imposing effect and not less as they ploughed
the liquid element was the interest excited and the reminiscence
 the squire brought into action by the appearance the temple
gardens the simple yet neatly laid out greensward reminded him 
the verdant slope on part his domains at belville hall but here the
resemblance finished a diminutive although pure and limpid rivulet
only passed the slope alluded to and here was a world waters into
which the influx ten thousand such rivulets would produce no apparent
increase amidst these cogitations by the squire and others an
unknown description by dashall the boat passed underneath blacksmiths
bridge and the lofty doom st paul burst upon the view the two
associates with gigantic majesty and withdrew from their minds every
impression save that the towering object in view superseding the
consideration all else either present or retrospective
rest on your oars was the order now given by the two friends and
while the waterman implicitly obeyed the mandate they gazed with
enthusiasm on the stupendous edifice seen perhaps to better advantage
from the river than from any other station and felt proud in
their affinity to a country and countryman capable the former 
instituting and the latter carrying into effect so august an
undertaking
 during the building st paul's church a country
carpenter applied to the overseer the workmen for
employment as a carver the overseer smiling at the man's
temerity hearing he had never worked in london it was
observed by sir christopher wren who was present who
calling the man to him asked him what he had chiefly worked
at in the countrypigtroughs c was his answer well
then says sir christopher let us see a specimen your
workmanship in a sow and pigs the man returned in a few
days having performed his part with such exquisite skill
that he was immediately employed and in tine executed some
 the most difficult parts the cathedral to the great
astonishment all that knew the circumstance so true it
is that genius is often lost in obscurity
 again proceeding on their way they arrived in a few minutes at
another amongst the many in the metropolis those surprising works
 public utility which reflect the highest honor on the laudable
enterprize the present times the iron bridge known as southwark
bridge leading from the bottom queen street cheapside to
the borough it is constructed castiron and from the river
particularly presents an appearance elegance and magnificence
consisting three arches only the spacious span each stretching
across the thames in towering majesty affords an aquatic vista equally
novel and interesting
gliding on the pacific wave the trimbuilt wherry now passed under
the lofty elevation the centre arch and our observers were struck
with the contrast between the object their admiration and its ancient
neighbour london bridge that nameless shapeless bulk stone and
lime with its irregular narrow arches through which the pentup
stream rushes with such dangerous velocity
this gothic hulk said the squire is a deformity in the aspect 
the river and ought at least to be pulled down if not rebuilt
added his cousin even on the principle economy the large and
incessant expenditure in support this decayed structure would
be much more profitably applied in the erection a new bridge 
correspondent grandeur with the first metropolis in the universe but
the citizens seem inclined to protract the existence this heavy
fabric as a memento the bad taste their progenitors
full many a gem purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness in the desert air
 the indefatigable waterman continued to ply his oars sans
intermission and in a few minutes our two associates in adventure
were safely landed a short distance westward the bridge after
remunerating the waterman they ascended the stairs with an appetite
quickened by the water breeze and retired into the shades close at
hand for refreshment previous to a renewal their excursion
the shades near london bridge is a house or rather cellar much
resorted to by respectable citizens sober fame induced chiefly by
the powerful attraction genuine wines which may here be had either
drawn immediately from the wood and served in regular standard pewter
measures or in bottles also full measure containing the pure
beverage various age and vintages to these cellars numbers 
the most respectable mercantile characters adjourn daily enjoying
the exhilarating juice the grape and further attracted by the
pleasantness situation as commanding a full view the river
whence the refreshing breeze is inhaled and enjoyed
here then our heroes recruited and while taking their wine bob was
much gratified by the performance an itinerant band musicians
playing outside some the latest and most popular airs in a masterly
style execution among other numerous refinements and improvements
 the age observed dashall may be considered that our itinerant
metropolitan musicians for instead the vile discordant and grating
hurdygurdy the mechanical organ grinder and the catgut scraper
sawing a tune we have now parties who form themselves into small
bands really scientific and able performers who from instruments
well selected produce a combination delightful melody and this
progress harmony is equally evident with respect to vocalists who
frequently posting themselves opposite some well frequented tavern or
coffeehouse amuse the inmates with catches glees duets c and
trust to the liberal feelings which the concord sweet sounds may
have inspired for remuneration and encouragement
scarcely had dashall concluded his remarks when the musical
party ceased their instrumental exertions and diversifying the
entertainment one the performers struck up a song which we here
present to the reader as a subject not inapplicable to our work

it was but a few steps from the shades to the monument to which our
adventurers were now pursuing their way when they met with an incident
not unworthy observation do not leave your goods is the friendly
admonition generally inscribed in large characters over the resting
place for porters throughout the metropolis opposite the church 
saint magnus close by london bridge a porter having pitched his
load turned his back upon it and reclined himself against the post in
careless ease and security it was just as our heroes approached that
the porter had turned himself round to resume his burden when lo it
had vanished in what manner no one can tell without doubt one 
those numerous streetprowlers who are continually on the look out for
prey observing the remissness the porter had availed himself the
favourable opportunity and quietly walked off with his booty a crowd
collected round the sufferer but it afforded him neither sympathy nor
relief our associates however contributed in mitigation his loss
and proceeding up fishstreet hill were in a few moments shrouded
under the towering column the monument
ascending the spiral staircase black marble consisting three
hundred and fortyfive steps winding like a corkscrew to the summit
our aspirants reached their aerial station in the gallery this lofty
edifice and enjoyed one the most variegated and extensively 
interesting prospects any in the metropolis far as the eye could
reach skirting itself down the river a forest tall masts appeared
and the colours all nations waving gaily in the breeze gave a
splendid idea the opulence and industry the first commercial city
in the universe the moving panorama far beneath the giddy height
resembled the flitting figures a camera obscura the spacious
thames was reduced to a brook the stately vessels riding on its
undulating wave seemed the dwarfish boats the schoolboy navigator
and glancing on the streets and along london bridge horses dwindled
in appearance to mice and carriages to children's toys after having
enjoyed during several minutes the prospects afforded by their
elevated position the two friends descended and with a feeling 
relief again trod the safer and less difficult path terra firma 
our observers now turned their direction westward and passed into
lombard street chiefly formed bankinghouses and other public
edifices this street said dashall is noted as the focus wealth
the point convergence civic riches and its respectable bankers
are not more dignified by the possession superabundant property
than enhanced in the estimation their fellowcitizens by strictly
conscientious honour and integrity
and these not the least important in selfconsequence is the jolly
civic baronet continued dashall who has already come more than once
within the scope our observation
ecce homo behold the man responded the squire and the baronet
was descried rolling his ponderous form from the opposite alley to his
bankinghouse
it is rather unfortunate observed dashall that nature has not kept
pace with fortune in liberality to the baronet profuse in giving him
a colossal magnitude person he exhibits a most disproportionable
endowment intellect unlike his great prototype sir john in one
sense but yet resembling him in another he is not witty himself but
he occasions wit in others
you are very fond making a butt me observed the baronet to a
brother alderman by no means rejoined the latter i never was fond
 an empty butt in my life is the worthy baronet inclined at times
asked the squire in his capacity map to irradiate the gloom st
stephens
 o yes frequently particularly so when in the plenitude his
wisdom he conceives that he can enlighten the house with a modicum 
information the last time i heard him hold forth was as an apologist
for the tumultuary loyalists at the mansion house meeting when he
delivered himself in a manner so heterogeneous commonsense and
so completely in a style egotism as to excite the ridicule and
risibility the whole house and discompose the gravity even the
speaker himself
 the following is a strictly literal versification the speech
alluded to
the mansionhouse row and apology for
the loyalists
being a literal versification the eloquent speech sir
w ll m c rt s baronet in the house commons friday
february on the presentation by mr john smith the
petition the merchants london
i rise mr speaker indulgence entreating
a speech while i make on the mansionhouse meeting
the prior requisition was certainly signed
by men good substance with pockets well lin'd
with such i am ever good humour'd and civil
but worth without wealth i would pitch to the devil
the lord mayor i think then assum'd a position
 duty in yielding to said requisition
for may my oration be given to scorn
if ever i saw from the day i was born
a list more honoured more propertied men
and probably never may see such again
now high as i prize both the merits and station
 loyalists signing the first declaration
permit me to say it was too mild by half
too much milk and water some members may laugh
i care not i say that it did not inherit
the tythe a loyal and time serving spirit
i'm charged too with signing it nevertheless
i did for i knew not how else to express
my zeal in supporting with firm resolution
the crown and old england's decay'd constitution
who they are constitution and crown that sustain
the people should now else we labour in vain
and therefore i sign'd the forenamed declaration
altho such a weak milk and water potation
for why should the loyalists smother their cause
and lose the high gain ministerial applause
pon honour aye even in detractions despite
in corners and holes sir i take no delight
and never on any pursuit do i go
 which don't want the almighty to know
i signed sir the loyal lukewarm declaration
to bring to its senses a turbulent nation
to cheer up his majesty win his good graces
and keep his lov'd ministers still in their places
the honorable member my friend who spoke last
is not quite correct in detailing what pass'd
at the mansionhouse meeting for patiently heard
he was until symptoms riot appear'd
at last it broke out with a vengeance tis true
and dire was the fracas but what could we do
where adverse opinion so warmly prevail'd
and each with reviling his neighbour assail'd
why sir to this house i could prove in a minute
that greater majorities out than now in it
 sound thinking persons in these fair dominions
are scouting the honorable member's opinions
wellbred sir believe me and goodlooking people
were wedg'd in the mansionhouse quite a heap all
whilst i most politely besought their attention
but no not a word was i suffer'd to mention
a party oppos'd me altho no long speeches
i make a kind lesson that prudence still teaches
and waiting a hearing an hour perhaps longer
the dissonant clamour grew fiercer and stronger
in fact when i open'd my mouth the commotion
exceeded in fury the storms the ocean
some hale stout young men who had mix'd with the throng
and press'd the conflicting addressers among
escap'd from the meeting in tumult and smother
and swore that they never would visit another
i well recollect in the year ninetythree
a similar fracas i happen'd to see
the place grocers hall where contention was wrought
so high that a stout battleroyal was fought
indeed save one meeting i ne'er knew a case
where wrangling and fighting had not taken place
in that one so happen'd good luck to betide
its fortunate members were all on one side
reverting again to the mansionhouse row
when next our staunch loyalists mean to avow
their zeal may they issue a strong declaration
then mix'd with a water and milk preparation
the gout in my toe for i wore a great shoe
at last sent me home without bidding adieu
and now having said mr speaker thus much
i hope on this house the impression is such
the loyalists fully to clear and their leader
from charge at that meeting boisterous procedure
the honourable baronet now sat down amid the ironical cheers
 the treasury and the tumultuous laughter the whole house
 the two partners in adventure had now reached the mansion house
the justice room was open and the friends ascended the stairs in order
to witness the equitable dispensation right by the civic sovereign
the case now under investigation was a curious one and excited the
interest and amusement a numerous auditory
the itinerant exhibitor a dancing bear complained that the person
proprietor a small menage now summoned into the presence his
lordship illegally withheld from him a monkey his property and the
cidevant associate the ursine dancer aforesaid
on the other hand the master the menage roundly asserted that he was
the rightful proprietor the monkey and had been in possession the
animal for several years
my lord said the master the bear let the monkey be produced and
i will abide by his choice between this man and me as his master this
proposition appearing reasonable and pug having been brought forward as
evidence before giving his testimony made a respectful obeisance to the
chief magistrate and so far as chattering and grinning were indicative
 his good intentions seemed desirous expressing his courtesy to
the auditory in general after having stared about him for some time
with an inquisitive eye and corresponding gesticulation he discerned
the bearmaster and springing into his arms with all the eagerness 
affectionate recognition expressed the utmost joy at the unexpected
meeting and when the other claimant attempted to approach he repulsed
him in the most furious manner and clung to the friend his election
with renewed pertinacity
under these circumstances the monkey was adjudged to the bearmaster
as his proper owner and pug and his friend left the justice room with
mutual exchange endearments
nothing else meriting notice occurred to the two strangers in this
their new scene observation the civic sovereign having resigned the
chair to one the aldermen in order that he might attend the sessions
at the old bailey dashall and the squire at the same time retired
with the intention the day now waning apace making the best 
their way home which they reached without further adventure
chapter xiii
the charge is prepar'd the lawyers are met
the judges all rang'd a terrible show
i go undismay'd for death is a debt
a debt on demand so take what i owe
since laws were made for every degree
to curb vice in others as well as in me
i wonder we hasn't better company
upon tyburn tree
but gold from law can take out the sting
and if rich men like us were to swing
twould thin the land such numbers would string
upon tyburn tree
purposing to spend an hour in the sessions house at the old bailey
our adventurers started next morning betimes and reaching their
destination took their seats in the gallery for which accommodation
they were charged one shilling each which the squire denominated an
imposition inquiring his friend by what authority it was exacted
and to whose benefit applied as from the frequent sittings the
court and general crouded state the gallery the perquisites must be
considerable
custom in every thing bears sovereign sway answered dashall i know
not whence this is derived nor whose pockets are lined by the produce
but you will probably be surprised to learn that a shilling admission
is only demanded on common occasions and that on trials great public
interest from one to two guineas has been paid by every individual
obtaining admission
the arrival the judges now terminated this colloquy the lord mayor
and several aldermen were in waiting to receive them and these sage
expounders the law were conducted to the bench by the sheriffs 
london and middlesex the chief magistrate the city uniformly and 
right presiding at this court his lordship took his seat on
the same bench with the judges and the usual forms having been gone
through the dispensation justice commenced
several prisoners were tried and convicted capital felony during the
short space time that our associated observers remained in court
but the cases these wretched men and the consciousness their
impending fate seemed in no respect to operate upon their minds as
they left the bar apparently with perfect indifference
an unfortunate man was next brought forward and accused having
stolen from an auction room a couple wine glasses he was 
respectable demeanor and evidently had seen better days when asked
what he had to allege in his defence the victim misery preluding
his story with a torrent tears told the following piteous tale 
distress
he had been in business and sustained an unimpeachable integrity 
character for many years independence seemed within his reach when
misfortune equally unforeseen as inevitable at all points assailed
him in the course one disastrous year death deprived him his
family and adversity his property he had unsuccessfully speculated
and the insolvency several who were considerably indebted to him had
completed his ruin at the time he committed the act for which he stood
convicted at that bar he had not tasted food for three days neither
had he in the world a friend or relative to whom he could apply for
relief the jury found him guilty but strongly recommended him to
mercy the judge humanely observed that the least possible punishment
should be inflicted on the prisoner he was then sentenced to a fine
 one shilling and to be discharged a sum money the spontaneous
bounty the spectators was immediately collected for him while one
 the jury promised him employment on his calling at his house on
the following day the gratitude the poor man was inexpressible
the sudden transition from the abyss despair to the zenith hope
seemed to overwhelm his faculties he ejaculated a blessing on his
benefactors and departed
 dashall and his friend were much affected by this incident
another however presently occurred a more lively description
in the course the next trial the counsellor on crossexamining
a witness found occasion to address him with well my old buck
i suppose you are one those people who do not often go to
church perhaps said the other if the truth were known i am as
often there as you are the promptness the reply produced a laugh
in which the witness very cordially joined what makes you laugh said
the lawyer is not every body laughing replied the other true
said the man law but do you know what they are laughing at why
i think in my heart rejoined the fellow that they take either me or
you to be a fool but i do not know which
the judge at this repartee could not retain his gravity a tumult 
mirth pervaded the whole court and the discomfited counsellor adjusted
his wig and sat down
during the few minutes longer that our heroes remained nothing 
interest occurring they withdrew and passing down the old bailey to
lydgate street and from thence towards the temple they crossed fleet
street and taking the direction shire lane were induced by way 
investigating real life in its lowest classification to enter one 
those too frequent receptacles vice denominated coffee shops
this was a house notorious irregularity the occupant which had
more than once experienced the visitation the law for his utter
contempt social order and from the present appearance his guests
it did not seem that legal interference had effected moral amendment
as our two friends entered this augean stable a whisper surprise
mingled with dismay went round the motley assemblage female
streetdrabs cracksmen and oglehunters and a wary glance 
suspicion darted from the group many a time and oft on the newcomers
who notwithstanding kept possession their seats and ordering without
apparent notice the party a cup coffee apprehension subsided into
security the reassured inmates resumed their interrupted hilarity and
our adventurers were thus afforded the means censurable observation
 cracksmen burglars oglehunters pickpockets
 the squire who had not perused the annals blackguardism and
consequently was not an adept in the knowledge the slang or vulgar
tongue was under the frequent necessity applying to his friend for
explanation the obscure phraseology those ladies and gentlemen 
the pad which dashall contrived to occasionally interpret without the
assistance or notice its multitudinous learned professors
the desire witnessing the exhibition real life in its lowest
state human degradation induced a prolongation stay by our two
associates in the meanwhile the mirth and fun grew fast and furious
exemplified by dance song and revelry interspersed with practical
jokes recriminate abuse and consequent pugilistic exercise where
science and strength alternately prevailed and in deficiency other
missiles poker tongs coffeecups saucers and plates were brought
into active requisition the scene was a striking illustration 
confusion worse confounded luckily our two observers were in a
situation without the reach injury they therefore smiled at the
tumult and enjoyed the storm
the landlord now interfered in defence his fragile property
preliminaries peace were agreed on through his high mediation and
finally ratified betwixt the contending parties ending as they began
like many other conflicting powers statu quo ante bellum 
and now to serious business we'll advance says one the king's 
brentford
but first let's have a dance
the present party followed exactly mr baye's proposition the dance and
the row over they now proceeded to serious business
seated in various groups each engaged itself in conversation which
from its almost inaudible expression was singularly contrasted with the
recent tumultuous uproar
the next box where sat our two friends was occupied by cracksmen and
oglehunters one whom whose superior skill gave him an ascendancy
over his associates had delineated on the table the plan certain
premises and having given in a very low tone voice a verbal
illustration to his fellowlabourers with what intention it is not
difficult to conjecture observed we may as well pad walk it as
sir oliver the moon is not out to night
 the party to whom this remark was addressed prepared to pad it
accordingly when the desired egress was opposed by the entrance 
three men who unbuttoning their great coats exhibited each a hanger
and brace pistols and took the whole community male and female
into safe custody
this was a coupdemain on the part the captors and sustained with
the most perfect sang froid by the captured
the officers next turned their attention to dashall and tallyhoho who
giving their cards and candidly explaining the motives which led them
into the temporary society the prisoners they were treated with
becoming respect the officers with their captives proceeding on
their route to bow street and our heros to the occurrence future
adventure
tallyhoho congratulated himself on his escape from expected mortification
and inconvenience but dashall whose more active and enterprizing mind
was not to be checked by trifles enjoyed the vague apprehensions his
friend and by way making amends for the penance they had inflicted
on themselves in shire lane agreed to dine and finish the evening at a
tavern in covent garden
thither then as they pursued their course the squire expressed his
surprise that a final stop was not put to scenes such as they had just
witnessed and all such places nefarious rendezvous abolished by the
vigilance the police
on the contrary observed dashall it is the interest the
police not utterly to destroy these receptacles vice they are
the toleration haunts profligacy where the officers justice
are generally assured meeting the objects their inquiry and
therefore under proper restrictions and an occasional clearance
the continuance a minor evil is productive public benefit by
arresting the progress infamy and preventing the extension 
crime
passing along the strand the humane feelings the squire were excited
by apparently a mutilated veteran seaman who in a piteous tone 
voice supplicated his charitable consideration the applicant stated
that he had lost an arm and an eye and was deprived the use a leg
in the service his country without friend or home and entirely
destitute the means subsistence that he had no other resource
than that a humble reliance on public benevolence the squire with
his usual philanthropic promptitude drew out his purse but his 
friend intercepted the boon and inquired the seaman under whom in
what ship and in what action he had sustained his misfortunes to these
questions a satisfactory answer was given and the claim the man to
compassion and relief was about to be admitted when another inquiry
occurred are you a pensioner
a pause ensued in the interim the mendicant seeing a person approach
 whose recognition he was not at all ambitious dropped in a moment
his timber toe unslung his arm dashed a patch from his eye and set
off with the speed a racehorse
during the amazement our two observers real life excited by this
sudden and unexpected transformation the officer for such was the
quondam acquaintance the imposter introduced himself to their
notice gentlemen said he you are not up to the tricks london
that fellow on whom you were about to bestow your charity and who has
just now exhibited his agility is one the greatest imposters in
london however i shall not run him down at present i know his
haunts and reckon sure my game in the evening
i confess replied dashall that in the present instance i have
been egregiously deceived i certainly am not up to all the tricks 
london although neither a johnny raw nor a greenhorn and yet i would
not wish to prove callous to the claim distress even if sometimes
unguardedly bestowing the mite benevolence on an undeserving object
the society for the suppression mendicity in the metropolis said
the officer think differently they recommend that no relief should be
given to streetbeggars
then said dashall offended by the officer's interference i envy
them not the possession their feelings and the two friends renewed
their walk
proceeding without further interruption our pedestrians were induced
to intermingle with a crowd which had collected round a man who wore
a most patriarchal redundancy beard and had been recognized by an
acquaintance as a shoemaker the name cooke a disciple the
american prophet john decker
 their high mightiness the mobility were mischievously inclined
and would certainly have grossly insulted if not injured the
poor devotee had not dashall and his friend taken him under their
protectionist he had been quietly making his way through covent garden
market when the greetings and surprise his friend at his strange
transformation attracted the curiosity the multitude and his
unhesitating declaration that he meant to accompany the great prophet
to jerusalem excited derision and indignation against the unfortunate
enthusiast when luckily our two heros interposed their good offices and
conducted the proselyte in safety to the shakespeare tavern
 on monday in consequence a very great uproar on sunday
night in worcester street southwark about the house 
the american prophet john decker that singular person was
brought before the magistrates this office the
inhabitants the neighbourhood having attributed the
disturbance to the unfortunate fanaticism the prophet and
his followers
the constables stated that on sunday night at halfpast
eight o'clock they saw a mob consisting about three
hundred people collected at the door the house and
heard the cries murder issue from within the officers
on going up stairs found the prophet lying on his back
some persons who had been abusing him escaped and the
prophet said the cause their violence was that he had
refused to get out his bed to preach he was conveyed to
the watchhouse the witnesses informed the magistrate that
the prophet had made some proselytes who were actually
about to leave the country with him and accompany him upon
an expedition to the holy land the parish officers were
naturally alarmed at the inconveniences to which such an
emigration would expose them and hoped that every thing the
arm the law could do projected entertainment
 amidst the busy note preparation the important day at last
arrived the suite apartments became thronged with company and everyone
admired the elegance the furniture the tasteful ornaments 
the rooms the brilliancy the lights and massive construction the
valuable family plate in fact every thing conspired to give eclat to
the scene and confirm the friends the founder the feast in their
belief alike his exquisite judgment and high respectability
the silversmith that he might not appear indelicately obtrusive let a
few days elapse after this grand gala had taken place before he applied
for restoration his property the borrower congratulated him on his
good fortune told him that several friends had very much admired the
plate and even expressed an intention ordering similar services and
that with regard to the borrowed plate he had taken so strong a fancy
to it as to feel disposed to become a purchaser if the price was
reasonable and an adequate consideration was made for prompt payment
the silversmith who chuckled inwardly at the prospect extending
his business and connecting himself with so many honourable men
gratefully expressed his acknowledgments and assuring him liberal
dealing the several items the borrowed plate were examined and
dilated upon the price each article after much higgling was
ultimately fixed the sum total ascertained and an early clay appointed
for a final settlement the accompt it never was the intention the
borrower to return the plate but he now had achieved a great object
by entirely changing the whole complexion the business he had now
converted fraud into debt and happen what might the silversmith could
only sue him on a civil process which against a limb the law and
as such privileged from arrest must be tedious and uncertain whereas
had he made away with the plate without accomplishing the object 
this last manoeuvre such is the indiscriminating severity english
law that he might have been amenable to the punishment felony
now comes the reckoning when the banquet's o'er the parties met
for final settlement when behold the accepted purchaser offers the
silversmith a bill at a month he refuses it indignantly and consults
his solicitor as to the possibility compelling the restoration the
plate but the lawyer told him that on his own shewing this could not
be done the silversmith had now no other resource than that taking
the proposed bill and waiting the expiration the month for
payment in the meanwhile the debtor exhibiting the talent an able
conveyancer transmuted the silver into gold and now laughs at the
credulity london tradesmen and sets the silversmith at defiance
 this incident as related by dash all actually and very
recently occurred
an interesting and useful volume might be compiled on the
subject frauds practised on london tradesmen many 
these tricks have been highly characteristic ingenuity
the following is a ludicrous instance female stratagem
we give the article literally as it occurred
a few days ago a female apparently a person rank
visited in her carriage towards the evening a silk
mercer's shop westward temple bar where she made
choice for purchase silks and other rich articles 
feminine dress and decoration to the value above fifty
pounds her manner was that a perfectly wellbred
gentlewoman and her person displayed no small portion 
attractive and elegant accomplishment having completed
her selection she expressed much regret that she could not
pay the amount the bill on the instant butshe
continued it is a delightful evening my house is in the
suburbs town a short and easy ride will prove a pleasant
recreation and if you will accompany me home in my
carriage you shall on our arrival be immediately paid
the mercer was more gallant spirit than to reject the
courtesy a lady so fair and fascinating and accepting
with pleasure the preferred honour the vehicle soon
reached its destination the lady first alighted taking
with her into an elegant mansion the articles 
purchase the mercer presently followed was shewn into a
handsome drawingroom and received with much politeness by
apparently by a gentleman the faculty a silence a
few minutes ensued when the mercer inquired for the lady
observing at the same time that it was necessary he should
return to town immediately the courteous physician
recommended silence and the mercer became irritated and
clamorous for his money and freedom exit two
attendants making their appearance they were directed to
conduct the patient to his apartment the mercer
suspecting that he was the dupe artifice grasped a
poker with the intention effectking at all hazard his
liberation from durance vile but his efforts had no other
result than that confirming his trammels and he was
presently bound over to keep the peace under the guarantee
 a straightwaistcoat the unfortunate mercer now told a
plain unvarnished tale which gained the attention the
humane physician who was no other than the proprietor 
the mansion in which he managed its concerns as an asylum
for lunatics the lady who accompanied the mercer to the
house had been with the physician the preceding day and
made arrangements with him for the reception an insane
patient it was now discovered that she had come under a
fictitious name had retreated in the hired vehicle with the
mercer's property and had adopted this curious stratagem
the more effectually to silence suspicion and prevent
detection
 this detail threw the squire into a train rumination on the
tricks and chicanery metropolitan adventurers while dashall amused
himself with the breakfasttable concomitant the newspaper a few
minutes only elapsed when he laid it aside approached the window
and seeing a funeral pass in procession along the street he turned
towards his cousin and interrupted his reverie with the following
extemporaneous address
dost thou observe he said yon sable tribe
 death anticipates these are they
who when men die rejoice all others else
 human kind shed o'er departed friends
the tear reminiscence these prowlers
hunt after death and fatten on his prey
mark now their measur'd steps solemn and slow
and visage each doleful form that wears
the semblance distress they mourn for hire
and tend the funeral rites with hearts stone
their souls apathy would never feel
a moment's pang were death at one fell sweep
even all their relatives to hurl from earth
knaves there exist among them who defraud
the grave for sordid lucre who will take
the contract price for hurrying to the tomb
the culprit corse the victim the law
but lay it where think'st thou in sacred ground
no in the human butcher's charnelhouse
who pleas'd reserves the felon for the knife
and bribes the greater villain with a fee
cousin bob was very much surprised by this sudden effusion and
inquiring the source inspiration dashall put into his hands the
newspaper pointing to the following extraordinary communication
extracted verbatim
 the king v cundick this was an indictment against the
defendant undertaker to the cheesemongerlane gaol for a
misdemeanour in corruptly selling for dissection the body
 a capital convict after he had been executed contrary
to his duty in violathon public decency and the
scandal religion there were various counts in the
indictment charging the offence in different ways the
defendant pleaded not guilty
the case excited considerable interest as well for its
unprecedented novelty as the singularity its
circumstances it was a public prosecution at the instance
 the magistracy the county
mr nolan and mr holland conducted the case for the crown
and mr adolphus mr burton and mr roland were for
the defence
it appeared in evidence that a capital convict named edward
lee who had been tried and found guilty at the last
croydon assizes a highway robbery was publicly executed
at horsemongerlane gaol on monday the tooth september
after he was cut down he was delivered over to the
defendant the appointed carpenter and undertaker the
gaol for interment at the county's expense for which he
was allowed three guineas he received particular
directions that the afflicted mother and other friends 
the deceased were to be permitted to see the body before
interment and follow it to the grave if they thought
proper the friends the deceased called on the
defendant who lives in redcrossstreet to know when the
funeral would take place he appointed the following day
tuesday the th september the unhappy mother the
deceased being confined to her bed was unable to attend
the funeral but sent a friend to the house the defendant
to see the body and cut a lock its hair application
being made to the defendant for this purpose he said he had
already buried the body because he could not keep such
people any longer in his house the friend demanded a
certificate the funeral which he promised to procure on
a subsequent day upon paying a fee on the thursday
following the uncle the deceased called for a certificate
 the burial but could not get it the defendant then
saying that the body had been buried the day before the
friends then became clamorous and complaint being made to
mr walter the gaoler he sent repeatedly for the defendant
to come to the gaol and explain his conduct which he
declined at length one the turnkeys was sent after
him on the friday with positive directions to bring him
forthwith as soon as the defendant found that he was
compelled to go to mr walter he made an excuse that he
had some immediate business to attend to but would meet the
messenger in an hour at a neighbouring publichouse to
this the turnkey consented but watched the defendant to his
house where he saw two or three suspicious looking men
lurking about after waiting for some time the defendant
came to him and expressed his surprise that he was not gone
to the publichouse the defendant appeared agitated and
went off as hard as he could towards the southwark iron
bridge a person named crisp who was with the turnkey
went one way after the defendant and the turnkey another
the latter went to crawford's burial ground where he saw
the same suspicious looking man whom he had observed about
the defendant's house in the act interring a coffin
he immediately interposed and said the coffin should not be
buried until he examined its contents at this moment
the defendant came into the buryingground and
seemed angry at the interruption and begged he
might be allowed to inter the body which he acknowledged
was edward lee and excused himself for not burying it
before by saying that the pressure other business
prevented him the turnkey remonstrated with him for
disobedience the orders he had received to permit the
friends the deceased to see the body and attend the
funeral the defendant seemed greatly perplexed at length
he took hold crisp and the turnkey by the sleeve and
with considerable agitation offered them l each to
permit him to bury the coffin and say no more about the
matter this was peremptorily refused the turnkey insisted
upon opening the coffin and whilst the defendant went to
explain his conduct to mr walter he did open it and found
that it contained nothing but earth it appeared that the
defendant had been applying to the sexton in the course 
the week for a certificate the burial but was unable to
succeed the body not having been buried search was then
made for the body and at length it was traced to mr
brooks's dissecting rooms in blenheimstreet marlboroughstreet
where it had undergone a partial dissection the
upper part the scull had been removed but replaced
several persons identified the body as that edward lee
it was proved that about ten o'clock in the evening 
tuesday the th september a hackneycoach had stopped at
the defendant's house and the defendant was seen assisting
two men in lifting a large hamper into the carriage which
then drove off this was the substance the case for the
prosecution
mr adolphus in an able and ingenious address to the jury
contended that the indictment must fail inasmuch as the
evidence did not satisfy the allegation in the indictment
that the defendant had sold the body for lucre and gain now
there was no proof whatever that it had been sold which
might have easily been made out if the fact was so by
summoning mr brooks the anatomist the real fact was that
the body had been stolen by other persons from the
defendant's house and the defendant had been driven to the
miserable shifts proved in evidence in order to conceal the
misfortune and prevent the loss his lucrative situation
in the gaol
no witnesses to facts were called for the defendant but
several persons gave him a good character for honesty and
industry
the jury under the learned judge's directions found the
defendant guilty
 the squire having perused this appalling account human
depravity expressed himself in energetic terms indignation against
the miscreant who to the acute miseries maternal affliction at
the premature loss a son and by such a death could add the bitter
anguish consigning his cold remains unseen by any earthly spirit 
sympathy to the knife the dissector in breach every law moral
and divine in the warmth his kindly feelings the squire would have
uttered a curse had he not been prevented by the entrance his
old friend sir felix o'o'grady the two friends received their quondam
acquaintance with much cordiality cush la mevchree exclaimed the
baronet shaking heartily the hands tom and bob and how have
you done these many long days past this inquiry having been
satisfactorily answered sir felix explained the object his
visit aunts all sorts or any sort or no sort at all at all
said he are cursed bad things sure enough as somebody in the play
says
this abrupt commencement excited the risible feelings dashall and his
cousin which were further stimulated by sir felix seriously appealing
to their commiseration under the pressure misfortune for this
same respectable maiden lady mrs judith macgilligan my venerable aunt
as aforesaid has recently imported her antiquated piece virginity
from her native mountains near belfast and having had my address
pat enough the worse luck the soul with an affected anxiety for my
welfare must take up her residence while in town in the same house
with her dutiful nephew that she may have the opportunity watching
over him in his erratic pursuits as she says with maternal solicitude
that is in other words to spy into all my actions and bore me
everlastingly with her intolerable company it was but the blessed
morning yesterday that she took a fancy to exhibit her beautiful
person at the lounge in bondstreet bythebye this same paragon 
perfection has passed her grand climacteric being on the wrong side
 sixty is as thin as a lath and as tall as a maypole speaks an
indescribable language the mongrel kind between irish and scotch 
which she is profuse to admiration and forgetting the antiquity her
person prides herself on the antiquity her ancestry so much that
she is said to bear a strong resemblance to her grandmother judging
from the fulllength portrait painted seventy years ago that
worthy progenitor our family who was a descendent lineally
from o'brien king ulster that she copies her dress on all public
occasions to the great amusement and edification the spectators and
in these venerable habiliments she promenaded bondstreet hanging on my
arm by the powers till i felt ashamed my precious charge for all
the world was abroad and my reverend aunt was the universal magnet 
attraction
well and you find yourself comfortable said dashall we have all
 us foibles and why expect your aunt to be exempted from them have
you any thing in expectance is she rich
 twenty thousand pounds twice told replied sir felix
sterling money great britain in which i have a reversionary
interest
why then said tallyhoho you cannot do better than contribute all in
your power to her ease and pleasure and in exercising this commendable
duty you will gain present satisfaction and may justly anticipate
future benefit
and added dashall if my cousin or myself can by any means further
your object in contributing towards the full attainment your aunt's
amusement while she remains in town you may command our services
by the powers fortune exclaimed the baronet you have just given
me the opportunity i was wishing for that is i had a favour to ask
but which i could not find courage enough to do notwithstanding my
native assurance until now you must know then that on easter monday
the illustrious judith macgilligan descendant lineally from o'brien
king ulster means to honour the civic entertainment with her sublime
presence and grace the ball at the mansionhouse in a dress resembling
that her grandmother the princess worn seventy years ago now my
dear friends having pledged yourselves to contribute all in your power
towards the pleasure my venerable aunt which you will be her
partner for the evening
the pause a moment was succeeded by a hearty laugh tallyhoho had
no objections to the hand as a partner at the ball miss judith
macgilligan even should she choose to array herself after the manner
 the princess her grandmother but dashall observing that as no masque
balls were given at the mansionhouse it would be necessary that miss
macgilligan should forego her intention appearing otherwise than
in modern costume sir felix undertook to arrange this point with
his relative and in the name and on behalf squire tallyhoho 
melvillehall to engage the distinguished honour her hand at
the ensuing mansionhouse ball this important affair having been
satisfactorily adjusted it was proposed by dashall that as his cousin
and the baronet had neither them ever been present at the epping hunt
on easter monday they should form themselves into a triumvirate for the
purpose enjoying that pleasure on the morrow the squire having in
town two hunters from his own stud embraced the proposition with
the avidity a true sportsman and sir felix declining the offer 
one these fleetfooted coursers it was agreed they should be under
the guidance tom and bob and that sir felix should accompany them
mounted on his own sober gelding early in the morning to the field 
nimrod from which they purposed to return to town in sufficient time to
witness other holiday sports before dressing for the entertainment at
the mansionhouse
these preliminaries settled and sir felix agreeing to take a potluck
dinner with his two friends the trio resolved on a morning lounge
 observation and sallying forth took their way along piccadilly
accordingly
although it was sunday morning this street presented with the
exception the shops being closed nearly the same appearance 
bustle as on any other day the number pedestrians was not apparently
less and equestrians and carriageoccupants an increase the two
latter description the ton actually or wouldbe passing onwards to
the general sunday rendezvous hydepark where real life in london is
amusingly diversified and where may be seen frequently amongst
the promiscuous promenaders the mall a prince the bloodroyal
undistinguishable by external ornament from any the most humble in
the moving panorama while an endless succession carriages in which
are seated what england beyond any other country may proudly boast 
some the most beautiful women in the world present the observer
with an enlivening theme admiration and together with the mounted
exhibiters from the man fashion on the pampered prancing steed
to the youth hebdomadary emancipation on the hacked bucephalus 
rotten row form an assemblage at once ludicrous and interesting
having circumambulated the ring our triumvirate returned by the gate
in piccadilly and crossing from thence to constitutionhill dashall
pointed out to his companions the seat as now fixed upon on the
summit the green park a military pillar intended to be raised
in commemoration the many victories achieved by british valour in the
last war this plan if properly carried into effect by the erection
said dashall a column equal in splendor execution with
the glory it is meant to record will be the greatest ornament the
metropolis
if again added the squire it does not prove like some other recent
projections a castle in the air
 tallyhoho probably alludes to the long meditated monument in
memory the late princess charlotte towards the memory 
which a very large sum money was raised by public
subscription
without any other occurrence worthy remark the perambulators reached
home and enjoyed the comfortable quietude an excellent domestic
dinner without interruption every arrangement having been made for the
amusements next day the party broke up sir felix returning to
his lodgings to gladden the heart miss judith macgilligan with the
anticipation conquest and dashall and tallyhoho retiring to early
repose that they might encounter the business the morning with
recruited renovation next day
the feathered songster chanticleer
had wound his bugle horn
and told the early villager
the coming the morn
when the baronet made his appearance on a milkwhite steed before the
mansion dashall in a few moments the friendly trio were assembled in
the breakfastparlour and partook a hasty repast while the coursers
from the melvillestud destined to perform a prominent part in the
forthcoming adventures the day were getting in readiness the
preparations were soon completed the hunters two noble animals were
brought to the door
each with neck like a rainbow erecting his crest
pampered prancing and pleas'd his head touching his breast
saddle white surrey for the field tomorrow
was the order richard said the baronet but had he been in
possession such a horse as either these white surrey might have
gone to the devil
i'll warrant them both sound wind and limb and gentle to boot
said the squire come then if you wish to be wellmounted and would
really look like a baron bold seat yourself fearlessly on either
and bear yourself through the streets london with the dignity 
befitting a true magnanimous and puissant knight munster this
address had the desired effect it implied a doubt the baronet's
courage and he seated himself on the gallant steed immediately tom
and bob at same time betook themselves the former to the other high
mettled racer and the latter to the unassuming rejected rosinante
 sir felix a trifling delay however occurred the stirrups 
the baronet's charger were too short and he alighted while the groom
repaired the defect
now see him mounted once again
upon his nimble steed
full slowly pacing o'er the stones
with caution and good heed
whether like the slenderer's horse under the its guidance the
celebrated john gilpin the disdainful steed now in the management 
sir felix wondered what thing he'd got upon his back we are not
competent to decide but he certainly in his progress o'er the
stones manifested frequent impatience restraint these symptoms
 contumaciousness were nevertheless borne by the baronet without
complaint
till finding soon a smoother road
beneath its wellshod feet
the snorting beast began to trot
which galled him in his seat
and as if intuitively knowing the incapacity his rider to restrain
him and despising curb and rein the indignant animal set off at full
speed to the great dismay dashall and the squire who putting their
horses to the pith their mettle hurried after their friend with the
utmost solicitude luckily however the career the spirited animal
was impeded and finally stopped by the frequent interposition the
passengers on the road and the baronet was safely set down ready to
exclaim with hawser trunnion if ever i get astride the back 
such another harum sarum son a bitch again my name is not felix

the pursuers speedily rejoined the pursued and felt happy in the
knowledge his welfare the abashment the baronet occasioned
by this untoward adventure soon gave way to his characteristic
goodhumour and having resigned all further government 
the squire's unruly quadruped and resumed possession his own the
triumvirate proceeded towards the place destination
in the meanwhile the city horsemen arose with phoebus to mount their
nominates to be present at the enlargement the stag and were
roused from their slumbers according to order by the watchmen the
motley group that was early in the field furnished a capital subject
for the caricaturist carts horses lame mares and refractory conies
with their grotesque riders covered the field together with dandies in
chaises and the lassies from st giles's chicklane tapping and
st catherine's in market carts with their sweethearts considerably
swelled the number the hunters the stag was decorated with bunches
 ribbons and seemed when enlarged much more frightened at the
appearance the londoners than at the hounds his natural enemies
when the chase commenced never was witnessed such a scene confusion
and disorder upset carts and unhorsed huntsmen were seen in all
directions the stag went off in good style and out hundreds 
horsemen not above a dozen were able to keep their seats but a number
 fellows were on the lurk to take care the stray horses
after a cursory glance at the variegated and boisterous assemblage
the stag bounded forward with the velocity lightning amidst the
astounding shouts the multitude and was instantly followed by his
biped and quadruped foes indescribable diversity from the amateur
 the turf on his spirited and well caparisoned steed to the spavined
gelding bearing its cockney rider and numerous other annual
equestrians preceded by every description the canine race from
the high bred beagle to the cur low degree all was tumultuous
dissonance and confusion worse confounded tallyhoho enjoyed the scene
to the very acme delight and giving the reins to his experienced
courser high in blood and eager for accustomed exercise the noble
animal accompanied by its companion under the guidance dashall
started off with unrivalled celerity and in a few moments set all
competition at defiance sir felix in an attempt to follow his friends
leaped a fence but gaining the opposite side horse and rider came
to the ground fortunately neither them sustained any injury sir
felix however on regaining his footing found that his horse
which had gone forward was in possession a stranger who losing
his own had availed himself this opportunity remounting and now
pursued his way bareheaded for the wind had uncourteous uncovered
his pericranium and he abandoned his castor to its fate rather than
by stopping to pick it up risque the restitution his prize and
the wrath the baronet who stood spellbound against the fence
vociferously demanding his gelding and extending his arm in reiterated
denunciation vengeance the unceremonious intruder turning round on
the saddle without slackening his career bide you where you are
my fine fellow he provokingly exclaimed until the chase is over and
your gelding shall then be forthcoming if the sense misfortune is
alleviated by seeing it participated by others the baronet had ample
fund consolation for numbers around him were involved in similar
calamity he profited too by an admirable lesson patience under
disaster on the right his runaway gelding and its rider he
perceived a dismounted horseman quietly submitting to adversity by
seating himself on a bank while his unbuttoned steed pursued the chase
with abating celerity leaving its owner to wait at leisure its
return two cockney equestrians now approached at full speed the
fence where sir felix still stood in the attitude remonstrance and
irritation and attempting the leap one like the baronet gained the
opposite side but with a less successful result for the rider was
pitched over with some violence with his heels aloft in the air as if
about to perambulate the field on his hands while his horse came to the
ground on its face and knees suspended by its hind legs from the upper
bar the fence and vainly essaying at extrication the other cockney
sportsman was similarly situated his horse had not cleared the fence
neither had the rider although he had reached the neck his rosinante
in his progress to the opposite side in this position he assumed a
permanent aspect for his horse rested with his forelegs over the
fence and seemed incapable either retrograding or proceeding these
lessons taught the baronet resignation in mishap the result which
was the return in about an hour his friends tom and bob to his
great comfort which was further increased by their bringing with them
his gelding having recognized the animal in the possession a
stranger who on their claiming it as belonging to sir felix o'o'grady
very readily gave it up saying that the baronet had not forgot in the
midst his threats frequently to announce his name and hoping that
he would excuse him for having resorted to the privilege which every
person claims on this day taking care the stray horses the party
now fully satisfied with the humours and disasters the easter hunt
turned their steeds homewards and journeying unimpeded notwithstanding
the throng the road they quickly gained town without the occurrence
 any other memorable incident
having reached the mansion dashall sir felix acquainted tallyhoho with
the success his mission respecting the hand as a partner at the
mansionhouse ball the august descendant the kings ulster
the sage and venerable miss judith macgilligan o the beautiful
illustrissimo the sweet creature exclaimed the baronet with
commendable care her virgin purity and fair unsullied fame is
tenacious etiquette and insists that she shall be asked with all due
form and respect after i have introduced your squireship to the honour
 her notice at the mansionhouse by my conscience i believe she is
in love with your character and no doubt will prove desperately so with
your person faith and troth now she is both too young and too old for
matrimony too young because she may live to torment you these twenty
years to come which is a penance no sprightly lad should voluntarily
undergo for all her fortune and too old being in all respects
disqualified by age for the important object marriage which was
instituted for the procreation children
my dear sir rejoined the squire immaculate may the lady remain in
her person and property i have no views on either
by the powers charity retract that stern decree exclaimed the
baronet would you break the heart the lovesick nymph by chilling
indifference to the potency her charms and the magnitude her
fortune however all joking apart my good friends will you do my aunt
and your humble servant the honour calling at our lodgings we shall
wait your coming and proceed together to the civic entertainment this
was agreed to the baronet retired and the two cousins having the best
part the day still before them set out on a stroll to tothillfields
fair with the view ascertaining real life in westminster amongst
the middle and lower orders its extensive population
 crossing st james's park our two observers soon reached the
scene jollity here as in all the fairs held in london and its
vicinity was a vast assemblage idlers including both sexes and all
ages they talk the severity the times said dashall and the
distress the lower orders society i cannot say however that i
have witnessed any semblance distress or privation amongst such in
this metropolis to the extent represented in the whole course my
observation these fairs for instance more properly marts iniquity
are crammed to excess and in pursuit low enjoyment there appears no
deficiency pecuniary means in all these resorts dissipation
not only the shows are filled with spectators but the booths and
neighbouring publichouses are crowded with male and female revellers
the squire acquiesced in the correctness his friend's remark and
both coincided in opinion that the regular daily public places 
amusement in the metropolis afford ample opportunity for rational
recreation independent the continuance fairs which have no other
tendency than facilitating the progress licentiousness
dashall observed that on the present occasion in the midst so much
alleged distressthe booths and shows tothillfields fair were
much more extensive than in former years we must however said he
although the evil continues do the magistrates the justice to say
that they have acted meritoriously in preventing the erection those
dangerous machines named roundabouts by which at former fairs many
serious accidents were occasioned
illustration pages donkey cart race
while ton and bob were quizzing the costermongers and the senses
they in their turn were queered out their wipes thus another
cogent argument was afforded as to the necessity suppressing these
nuisances as being the rendezvous infamy and the harvest 
depredation the visitors appeared in all their glory as elegant
and boisterous as usual the consumption gin and gingerbread was
apparently prodigious and the great luxury amongst the fashionables was
fried sausages and the bolting oysters with sugar for wagers having
lost their wipes the two friends resolved at least to save their
tattlers and having seen a sufficiency westminster jollification
they left the fair to those visitors who might better appreciate its
enjoyment
returning home they were not encountered by farther mischance and
having shortly reached their destination and dressed for the evening
gala a chariot was ordered and they were set down at the lodgings 
sir felix o'o'grady
the baronet introduced his two friends to his aunt with much affected
form and with an arch leer expression which on an occasion 
minor import would have excited the risibility bob but this was no
laughing affair the presentation therefore was conducted with all due
solemnity and miss judith macgilligan received him with a maidenish
diffidence and complacency yet with the dignity becoming a descendant
 o'brien king ulster
having partaken a slight repast the party drove off in the lady's
temporary vehicle and rattling rapidly along the streets were in a
very short time arrived at the mansionhouse the company was select and
elegant the ladies particularly might vie in splendour ornament and
fascination personal charms with first rate beauties the west
and what gave the entertainment a superior zest above every other
consideration was the condescending affability the civic queen who
received her numerous and delighted guests with a truly hospitable yet
dignified politeness nor was there any deficiency on the part her
lord all that the most excellent arrangements and the most minute
attention could accomplish was done to the entire gratification and
comfort the company
 easter amusements mansionhouse the customary easter
civic dinner and ball were given at the mansionhouse a
material alteration was effected in the entertainment upon
this occasion by considerably abridging the number 
cards which it was the practice hitherto to issue the lady
mayoress received the company before dinner in the ballroom
in discharging which office her ladyship displayed
much ease and elegance manner the company adjourned to
the egyptian hall to dinner at about halfpast six o'clock
they consisted lord viscount sidmouth the earl 
shaftesbury mr peel and some other members the
ministry the lords bishop london and landaff and other
church dignitaries the lords chief justices england and
the court common pleas the vice chancellor several 
the diplomatic corps as well as the leading members the
senate and the army and other gentlemen distinction her
grace the duchess rutland and several ladies rank in
all about three hundred and fifty individuals both sexes
there were five tables laid out in the hall which from
being prettily ornamented with festoons flowers attached
to pillars along the centre each had an extremely
picturesque appearance upon entering the room after dinner
the usual toasts were drank and the respective parties
present returned thanks messrs pine broadhurst and other
professional gentlemen sung several songs and glees in
their happiest style at a little after nine o'clock the
lady mayoress and the ladies withdrew and the gentlemen
shortly afterwards rejoined them in the ballroom
at a little before ten o'clock the ballroom was prepared
and in a short time the most distinguished the guests
repaired thither the dresses the ladies were in general
particularly elegant the ball was opened by two the
younger daughters the lord mayor misses ann and harriet
magnae who danced the minuet de la cour in so elegant and
finished a manner as elicited general approbation the
quadrilles were led off by the duke de cases and baron
langsdorff and were continued with the greatest spirit
throughout the night the centre tables in the egyptian hall
were removed for the accommodation the company but the
side tables were retained and refreshments served out from
them in abundance
we believe that in the general participation pleasure
there existed one solitary exception only in the person 
miss judith macgilligan it unfortunately happened that an
opportunity offered not for the display her graces in the
dance she then became peevishly taciturn complained 
indisposition and expressing a desire returning home
the gentlemen consequently assented and the party left the
mansionhouse at an earlier hour than they had either
anticipated or desired

chapter xv
all london is full vagaries
 bustle splendour and show
at every turn the scene varies
whether near or still further we go
each lane has a character in it
each street has its pauper and beau
and such changes are making each minute
scarce one from the other we know
the in and out turnings life
few persons can well understand
but in london the grand source strife
is fortune to bear the command
yet some who are high up to day
acknowledged good sober and witty
may tomorrow be down in decay
in this great and magnanimous city
 apropos said the hon tom dashall laying down the times
newspaper after breakfast a fine opportunity is offered to us to day
for a peep at the citizens london in their legislative assembly a
court common council is announced for twelve o'clock and i think i
can promise you much entertaining information by paying a visit at
guildhall and its vicinity we have several times passed it with merely
taking a view its exterior but the interior is equally deserving 
attention particularly at a period when it is graced by the personages
and appendages which constitute its state and dignity london is
generally spoken as the first commercial city in the known world and
its legislators as a corporate body becomes a sort rallying post
for all others in the kingdom we have plenty time before us and
may lounge a little as we march along to amuse or refresh ourselves at
leisure with all my heart said tallyhoho for i have heard much
about the lord mayor the sword bearer and the common hunt all in a
bustle though i have never yet had an opportunity seeing any 
them
 they are interesting subjects i can assure you so come along
we will take a view these goes and magog civic notoriety
and thus saying they were quickly on the road for the city the morning
being fine they took their way down st james's street at the bottom
 which their ears were attracted by the sounds martial music
approaching
we have nicked the time nicely indeed said dashall and may now
enjoy a musical treat before we proceed to the oratorical one the
guards in and about the palace are relieved every morning about this
time for which purpose they are usually mustered at the horseguards
in the park where they are paraded in regular order and then marched
here it forms a very pleasing sight for the cockney loungers for those
out employ and those who have little inclination to be employed and
you see the crowds that are hastening before them in order to obtain
admission to palace yard before their arrival let us join the throng
there is another detachment stationed there ready to receive them
and while they are relieving the men actually on duty the two bands
alternately amuse the officers and the byestanders with some the
most admired overtures and military airs
they now passed the gate and quickly found themselves in a motley group
 all descriptions crowding to the seat action and pouring in
from various avenues men women and children halfdrilled drummers
bandylegged fifers and suckling triangle beaters with bags books
and instruments in their hands to assist the band the colours were
mounted as usual on a post in the centre the men drawn up in ranks and
standing at ease while the officers were pacing backwards and forwards
in the front arminarm with each other relating the rencontres the
preceding day or those in anticipation the ensuing this order 
things was however quickly altered as the relieving party entered
and at the word attention every officer was at his post and the men
under arms our friends now moved under the piazzas so as to be in the
rear the party who had the first possession and after hearing with
great admiration the delightful airs played by the two bands which
had been the principal object attraction with them they proceeded
through the park and reached charing cross by the way spring
gardens
 zounds said tallyhoho this is a very unworthy entrance to a
royal park
admitted it is so was the reply and a degradation to the splendid
palace i mean internally which is so close to it and which is the
present residence majesty they now proceeded without anything
further consequence worthy remark till they reached
villiersstreet
come said tom i perceive we shall have time to take a look at the
world below as well as the world above when crossing into the delphi
and suddenly giving another turn he entered what to bob appeared a
cavern and in one moment was obscured from his sight hallo said
tallyhoho where the devil are you leading me to never mind was the
reply keep on the right side and you are safe enough but if you get
into the centre beware the slough despond don't be afraid
upon this assurance bob groped his way along for a few paces and at a
distance could discover the glimmering a lamp which seemed but to
make darkness more visible keeping his eye upon the light and more
engrossed with the idea his own safety in such a place than any thing
else for he could neither conjecture where he was nor whence he was
going he presently came in violent contact with a person whom he could
not see and in a moment found himself prostrate on the ground
hallo cried a gruff voice which sounded through the hollow arches
 the place with sepulchral tone who the devil are you why don't
you mind where you go you must not come here with your eyes in your
pocket and at the same time he heard a spade dug into the earth which
almost inspired him with the idea that he should be buried alive
good god protect exclaimed bob where is dashall where am i
where are you why you're in the mud to be sure and for aught i know
dashall and all the rest may be in the clouds what business have you
dashing here we have enough the dandies above without having them
below what have you lost your way or have you been nibbling in the
light and want to hide yourself eh
 neither neither i can assure you but i have been led here
and my friend is on before
oh well if that's the case get up and i'll hail him
eyyaap cried he in a voice which seemed like thunder to our
fallen hero and which was as quickly answered by the well known voice
 his cousin who in a few minutes was at his elbow
what now vociferated tom i thought i gave you instructions how to
follow and expected you was just behind me
why for the matter that cried the unknown he was not before
you that's martin and he knocked himself down in the mud before ever
i spoke to him that's all i know about it but he don't seem to
understand the navigation our parts
i don't wonder at that replied tom for he was never here before in
his life but there is no harm done is there
none replied bob all's right again now so proceed
nay replied the unknown all's not right yet for if as how this
is your first appearance in the shades below it is but fair you should
come down
down said bob why i have been down you knock'd me down
well never mind my master i have set you on your pins again and
besides that i likes you very well for you're down as a hammer and
up again like a watchbox but to my thinking a drap o'somut good would
revive you a little bit and i should like to drink with you for you
ought to pay your footing
and so he shall continued tom so come along my lad
by this time bob had an opportunity discovering that the person he
had thus unfortunately encountered was no other than a stout rawboned
coalheaver and that the noise he had heard was occasioned by his
sticking his pointed coalshovel in the earth with intention to help
him up after his fall pursuing their way and presently turning to the
right bob was suddenly delighted by being brought from utter darkness
into marvellous light presenting a view the river with boats and
barges passing and repassing with their usual activity
what place is this inquired tallyhoho
 before you replied his cousin is the river thames and
in the front you will find wharfs and warehouses for the landing and
housing various merchandize such as coals fruit timber c weare
now under the delphi terrace where many elegant and fashionable
houses are occupied by persons some rank in society these streets
lanes and subterraneous passages have been constructed for the
convenience conveying the various articles landed here into the main
streets the metropolis and form as it were a little world underground

and no bad world neither replied the coalheaver who upon inspection
proved to be no other than bob martlet whom they had met with as one
 the heavy wet party at charley's crib for there is many a family
lives down here and gets a good bit bread too what does it signify
where a man gets his bread if he has but an honest appetite to eat it
with aye and though i say it that house in the corner there just
down by the water's edge can supply good stuff at all times to wash
it down with and that you know's the time day my master this warm
weather makes one dryish like don't it
tom thought the hint dry enough though bob was declaring he was almost
wet through however they took their road to the fox under the hill
as it is termed on entering which a good fire presented itself and
tallyhoho placed himself in front it in order to dry his clothes
while bob martlet was busy in inquiring the landlord for a brush to
give the german a wipe down as he observed he had a sort a trip up
in these wild parts though to be sure that there was no great wonder
for a gentleman who was near sighted and didn't wear spectacles
however continued he there an't no harm done and so the german and
i are going to drink together ain't we sir
tallyhoho who by this time had got well roasted by the fireside nodded
his assent and dashall inquired what he would like
 why my master as for that it's not much matter to me a
drap sky blue in a boulter barley with a dollop sweet
and a little saw dust is no bad thing according to my thinking but
lord bless you if so be as how a german like you offers to treat bill
martlet
 a boulter barley a drink or a pot porter
 a dollop sweet sugar
 sawdust a cant term for ginger or nutmeg grated
why bill martlet never looks a gift horse in the mouth you know as the
old saying is but our landlord knows how to make such rum stuff as i
should like you to taste it we call it hot don't us landlord come
lend us hold the brush ave and brush up mr landlord said the
hon tom dashall let us have a taste this nectar he's talking 
for we have not much time to stop
lord bless your eye sight replied martlet there an't no occasion
whatsoever for your honours to stay if you'll only give the order
and push about the possibles the business is all done come shovel up
the sensible continued he to the landlord mind you give us the real
double xx i don't think your coat is any the worse it would serve me
for a sunday swell toggery for a twelvemonth to come yet for our dirt
down here is as i may say clean dirt and d me if i don't think it
looks all the better for it
thank you my friend said bob that will do very well and the
landlord having by this time completed his cookery produced the good
stuff as martlet termed it
come gentlemen this is the real right sort nothing but the bangup
article ain't it my master but as i always likes the landlord to
taste it first by way setting a good example just be after telling
us what you think it
with all my heart said the landlord who declared it was as prime a
pot hot as he had made for the last fortnight 
with this recommendation our friends tried it and after tipping took
their departure under the positive assurance martlet that he should
be very glad to see them again at any time
they now pursued their way through other subterraneous passages where
they met waggons carts and horses apparently as actively and usefully
employed as those above ground
come said tom we have suffered time to steal a inarch upon us as
they reached the strand we will therefore take the first rattler
we can meet with and make the best our way for the city this
was soon accomplished and jumping into the coach the old jarvey
was desired to drive them as expeditiously as possible to the corner 
kingstreet cheapside

look sir look sir what you've done
zounds you've cut off the alderman's thumb
the hon tom dashall who was fully aware that city appointments for
twelve o'clock mean one was nevertheless anxious to arrive at their
place destination some time before the commencement the business
 the day and fortunately meeting with no obstruction on the road
they were set down at the corner kingstreet about halfpast twelve
come said he we shall now have time to look about us at leisure
and observe the beauties this place civic festivity the hall you
see in front you is the place devoted to the entertainment usually
given by the lord mayor on his entrance upon the duties and dignities 
his office it is a fine gothic building in which the various courts
 the city are held the citizens also meet there for the purpose 
choosing their representatives in parliament the lord mayor sheriffs
c it was originally built in the year previous to which period
the public or as they term it the common hall was held at a small room
in aldermanbury
 the expense the building was defrayed by voluntary
subscription and its erection occupied twenty years it was seriously
damaged by the fire since which the present edifice with the
exception the new gothic front has been erected that however
was not finished till the year and many internal improvements and
decorations have been introduced since there is not much attraction
in its outward appearance that new building on the right has recently
been erected for the accommodation meetings bankrupts and on the
left is the justiceroom where the aldermen attend daily in rotation as
magistrates to decide petty causes but we must not exhaust our time now
upon them
on entering the hall tallyhoho appeared to be highly pleased with its
extent and was presently attracted by the monuments which it contains
it is a noble room said he yes replied tom this hall is
 feet in length in breadth and the height to the roof is 
tallyhoho was however more engaged in examining the monument erected to
the memory lord nelson and an occasional glance at the two enormous
figures who stand at opposites on the left the entrance having
read the tablet and admired the workmanship the former he hastily
turned to the latter and who in the name wonder are these he
inquired
these replied his communicative cousin are called gog and
magog they are two ancient giants carved in wood one holding a
long staff suspending a ball stuck with pikes and the other a albert
supposed to be great antiquity and to represent an ancient briton
and a saxon they formerly used to stand on each side that staircase
which leads to the chamberlain's office the courts king's bench and
common pleas the court aldermen and the common council chamber at
the other are two fine monuments to the memory lord chatham the
father mr pitt and his son the windows are fine specimens 
the revived art painting on glass there is also a monument mr
beckford
while they were taking a view these several objects curiosity
their attention was suddenly attracted by a confused noise and bustle
at the door which announced the arrival the lord mayor and his
attendants who passed them in state and were followed by our friends
to the council chamber on entering which they were directed
by the city marshall who guarded the door to keep below the bar
tallyhoho gazed with admiration and delight on the numerous pictures with
which the chamber is decorated as well as the ceiling which forms a
dome with a skylight in the centre the lord mayor having first entered
the court aldermen the business the day had not yet commenced
tom directed his cousin's eye in the first instance to the very large
and celebrated painting by copley which fronts the lord mayor's
chair and represents the destruction the floating batteries before
gibraltar to commemorate the gallant defence that place by general
elliott afterwards lord heath field in the statue the late
king george the third the death david rizzio by opine the miseries
 civil war from shakespeare domestic happiness exemplified in
portraits an alderman and his family the death wat tyler the
representation the procession the lord mayor to westminster hall
by water and the ceremony swearing in the lord mayor at guildhall
in containing portraits all the principal members the
corporation london at that time meanwhile the benches were filling
with the deputies and common councilmen from their several wards at one
o'clock the lord mayor entered the court attended by several aldermen
who took their seats around him and the business the day commenced
among those on the upper seats tom gave his cousin to understand which
were the most popular the aldermen and named in succession messrs
waithman wood sir claudius stephen hunter birch flower and curtis
and as their object was not so much to hear the debates as to see the
form and know the characters he proposed an adjournment from their
present rather uncomfortable situation where they were obliged to stand
wedged in by the crowd continually increasing during which they could
take a few more observations and he could give some little clue to the
origin and present situations the persons to whom he had directed his
cousin's attention making the best their way out the court they
found themselves in an antiroom surrounded by marshalsea beadles 
wards waiting for their aldermen and the lord mayor's and sheriffs
footmen finding almost as much difficulty to proceed as they had
before encountered
 having struggled through this formidable phalanx judicial
and state appendages
now said dashall we shall be enabled to breathe again at liberty
and make our observations without fear for where we have just quitted
there is scarcely any possibility making a remark without having it
snapped up by newspaper reporters and retailers anecdotes here
however we can indulge ad libitum 
yes replied tallyhoho and having seen thus far i am a little
inquisitive to know more i have it is true at times seen the names
 the parties you pointed out to me in the daily prints but a sight 
their persons in their official stations excites stronger curiosity
then said tom according to promise i will give you a sort 
brief sketch some them the present lord mayor is a very eminent
wholesale stationer carrying on an extensive trade in queenstreet
he ought to have filled the chair before this but some temporary
circumstances relative to his mercantile concerns induced him to give up
his rotation he has since removed the obstacle and has been elected
by his fellowcitizens to the high and important office chief
magistrate i believe he has not signalized himself by any remarkable
circumstance but he has the character being a worthy man perhaps
there are few in the court aldermen who have obtained more deservedly
the esteem the livery london than alderman waithman whose
exertions have long been directed to the correction abuses and who
represented them as one their members during the last parliament
when he displaced the mighty alderman curtis waithman is humble
origin and has like many others civic notoriety worked his way
by perseverance and integrity as a linendraper to respectable
independence and the hearts his fellowcitizens he has served the
office sheriff and during that time acted with a becoming spirit at
the death the late queen by risking his own life to save others his
political sentiments are on the opposition side consequently he is no
favorite with ministers
and if he were replied tallyhoho that would scarcely be considered an
honour
true continued tom but then it might lead to profit as it has done
with many others though he appears to hold such very light
 alderman wood has not yet been so fortunate as the celebrated
whittington whom you may recollect was thrice lord mayor london but
he has had the honour to serve that office during two succeeding years
he is a member parliament and his exertions in behalf the late
queen if they have done him no great deal good among the higher
powers are at least honourable to his heart
 sir claudius stephen hunter there is but little to be said
except that he has served the office and been a colonel the city
militia led off the ball at a jew's wedding used to ride a white
charger and is so passionately fond military parade that had
he continued another year in the office the age chivalry would
certainly have been revived in the east and knightserrant and esquires
have completely superseded merchants traders and shopkeepers
alderman birch is an excellent pastrycook and that perhaps is the
best thing that can be said him he has written some dramatic pieces
but the pastry is beyond all comparison best the two and he needs no
other passport to fame at least with his fellowcitizens
but last though not least under our present consideration comes the
renowned sir william a plain bluff john bull he is said to be the
son a presbyterian citizen and was rigidly educated in his father's
religion he obtained the alderman's gown and represented the city in
the year he is a good natured and i believe a good hearted man
enough though he has long been a subject for satirical wit he was lord
mayor in you may recollect what was related him by the literary
labourer we met with in the park anecdotes and caricatures have been
published in abundance upon him he may however be considered in
various points view as an alderman and a biscuit baker as a
fisherman 
how cried tallyhoho
why as a fisherman he is the polyphemus his time
his rod was made out the strongest oak
his line a cable which no storm e'er broke
his hook was baited with a dragon's tail
he sat upon a rock and bobbed for a whale
besides which continued dashall he is a great sailor has a yacht
 his own and generally accompanies
 royalty on aquatic excursions i remember a laughable
caricature exhibiting the alderman in his own vessel with a turtle
suspended on a pole with the following lines in imitation 
blackeyed susan said to be written by mr jekyll
all in the downs the fleet lay moor'd
the streamers waving in the wind
when castlereagh appeared on board
ah where shall i my curtis find
tell me ye jovial sailors tell me true
does my fat william sail among your crew
he is a banker a loanmonger and a contractor a member parliament
and an orator added to which he may be said to be a man wit
and humour at all events he is the cause it in others his first
occupations have procured him great wealth and his wit and humour great
fame
the worthy alderman's hospitality to the late good humoured and
gossiping james boswell the humble follower and biographer dr
johnson is well known and it is probable that the pleasures the
table in which no man more joyously engaged shortened his life to
write the life a great man is no easy task and to write that a
big one may be no less arduous whether the alderman really expected to
be held up to future fame by the biographer johnson cannot be
very easily ascertained however that wish and expectation if it ever
existed was completely frustrated by the death poor boswell
i recollect to have seen some lines the worthy alderman on the
glorious victory the nile which shew at once his patriotism his
wit and his resolution in that he is not to be laughed out the
memorable toast he once gave
great nelson in the grandest stile
bore down upon the shores nile
and there obtained a famous victory
which puzzled much the french directory
the impudence them there fellows
as all the newspapers do tell us
had put the grand turk in a pet
which caus'd him send to nelson an aigrette
likewise a grand pelisse a noble boon
then let us hope a speedy peace and soon
 whether the following lines are from the same hand or not
we are unable to ascertain at least they wear a great
similarity character
i give you the three glorious c's
our church constitution and king
then fill up three bumpers to three noble vs
wine women and whale fishking
 egad said bob if this be true he appears to knock up
rhymes almost as well as he could bake biscuits smothering a laugh
why replied dashall i believe that it has not been positively
ascertained that these lines which unlike other poetry contain no
fiction but plain and undeniable matter fact were wholly indicated
by the worthy alderman indeed it is not impossible but that his
worship's barber might have had a hand in their composition it would
be hard indeed if in his operations upon the alderman's pericranium
he should not have absorbed some the effluvia the wit and genius
contained therein and in justice to this operator on his chin and
caput i ought to give you a specimen which was produced by him upon the
election his lordship to the mayoralty
our present mayor is william curtis
a man weight and that your sort is
this epigrammatic distich which cannot be said to be destitute 
point upon being read at table received as it deserved a large share
 commendation and his lordship declared to the company present that
it had not taken his barber above three hours to produce it extempore
tallyhoho laughed heartily at these satirical touches upon the poor
alderman
however continued tom a man with plenty money can bear laughing
at and sometimes laughs at himself though i suspect he will hardly
laugh or produce a laugh in others by what he stated in his seat in
the house commons on the subject the riots at knightsbridge
i suspect his wit and good humour will hardly protect him in that
instance
 on a motion made by mr favell in the court common
council on the st march the following resolution was
passed indicative the opinion that court entertained 
the conduct alderman curtis on the occasion here alluded
to
that sir william curtis bart having acknowledged in his
place in this court that a certain speech now read was
delivered by him in the house commons in which among
other matters which he stated respecting the late riot at
knightsbridge he said that he had been anxious that a
committee should investigate this question because he
wished to let the world know the real character this
great common council who were always meddling with matters
which they had nothing to do with and which were far above
their wisdom and energy it was from such principles they
had engaged in the recent inquiry which he would contend
they had no right to enter upon not only was evidence
selected but questions were put to draw such answers as the
party putting them desired
that the conduct sir william curtis one the representatives
 this city in parliament lias justly merited
the censure and indignation this court and his fellow
citizens
 after taking a cursory look into the chamberlain's office the
court king's bench and common pleas they took their departure from
guildhall very well satisfied with their morning's excursion
it was between three and four o'clock when our friends left the hall
tom shalt being upon the qui vive determined to give his cousin a
chevy for the remainder the day and for this purpose it being on
a friday he proposed a stroll among the praysellers in smithfield
where after partaking a steak and a bottle at dolly's they
accordingly repaired
you will recollect said tom that you passed through smithfield
which is our principal cattle market during the time bartholomew
fair but you will now find it in a situation so different that you
would scarcely know it for the same place you will now see it full
 horsejockeys publicans pugilists and lads upon the lark like
ourselves who having no real business either in the purchase or sale 
the commodities the market are watching the manners and manoeuvres 
those who have
as tom was imparting this piece information to his attentive cousin
they were entering smithfield by the way giltspurstreet and were
met by a man having much the appearance a drover who by the dodging
movements his stick directly before their eyes inspired our friends
so strongly with the idea some animal being behind them which they
could not see and from which danger was to be apprehended that they
suddenly broke from each other and fled forward for safety at which
a roar laughter ensued from the bystanders who perceiving
the hoax recommended the dandies to take care they did not dirty their
boots or get near the hoofs the prancing prays tom was not much
disconcerted at this effort practical jocularity though his cousin
seemed to have but little relish for it
come along said tom catching him by the arm and impelling him
forward although this is not bartholomew fair time you must consider
all fair at the horsefair unless you are willing to put up with a
horselaugh
struggling through crowds who appeared to be buying selling or
bargaining for the lame the broken winded and spavined prays 
various sizes prices and pretensions
there is little difference said tom between this place as a market
for horses and any similar mart in the kingdom
here the friend and the brother
meet to humbug each other
except that perhaps a little more refinement on the arts gulling
may be found and it is no very uncommon thing for a stolen nag to
be offered for sale in this market almost before the knowledge his
absence is ascertained by the legal owner i have already given you
some information on the general character horsedealers during our
visit to tatters's but every species trick and low chicanery is
practised which numerous instances might be produced and though i
admit good horses are sometimes to be purchased here it requires a
man to be perfectly upon his guard as to who he deals with and how he
deals although the regulations the market are generally speaking
good
i wouldn't have him at no price said a costermonger who it appeared
was bargaining for a donkey the h y sulky b won't budge
he's not worth a fig out a horses 
i knows better as that are cried a chimneysweeper for no better
an't no yare to be had he's long backed and strong legged here bill
you get upon him and give him rump steaks and he'll run like the devil
after a parson
here bill a little bleareyed chimneysweeper mounted the poor animal
and belaboured him most unmercifully without producing any other effect
than kicking up behind and most effectually placing poor bill in the
 mud to the great discomfiture the donkey seller and the
mirth the spectators the animal brayed the bystanders laughed and
the bargain like poor bill was off
after a complete turn round smithfield hearing occasionally the
chaffing its visitants and once or twice being nearly run over
they took their departure from this scene bustle bargaining and
confusion taking their way down kingstreet up lowborn hill and along
great queenstreet
now said tom we will have a look in at covent garden theatre the
exile is produced there with great splendour the piece is certainly got
up in a style the utmost magnificence and maintains its ground in
the theatre rather upon that score than its really interesting dialogue
though some the scenes are well worked up and have powerful claims
upon approbation the original has been altered abridged and by some
termed amended in order to introduce a gorgeous coronation a popular
species entertainment lately
upon entering the theatre tallyhoho was almost riveted in attention
to the performance and the latter scene closed upon him with all its
splendid pageantry before he discovered that his cousin had given him
the slip and a dashing cyprian the first order was seated at his
elbow with whom entering into a conversation the minutes were not
measured till dashall's return who perceiving he was engaged appeared
inclined to retire and leave the cooing couple to their apparently
agreeable teteastute bob however observing him immediately wished
his fair incognita good night and joined his cousin
d d dull said tom all weary stale flat and unprofitable
but very grand rejoined bob
i have found nothing to look at replied tom i have hunted every
part the house and only seen two persons i know
and i said tallyhoho have been all the while looking at the piece
which piece do you mean the one beside you or the one before you
the performance the coronation
i have had so much that said tom that finding you so close inattention
to the stage that i could get no opportunity 
speaking to you i have been hunting for other game and have almost
wearied myself in the pursuit without success so that i am for quitting
the premises and making a call at a once celebrated place near at hand
which used to be called the finish come along therefore unless you
have mettle more attractive perhaps you have some engagements
none upon earth to supersede the one i have with you was the reply
upon which they left the house and soon found themselves in covent
garden market this said tom has been the spot many larks and
sprees almost all descriptions ana election wit has been as cheap
in the market as any the vegetables the venders but i am going
to take you to a small house that has in former times been the resort 
the greatest wits the age sheridan fox and others their time
have not disdained to be its inmates nor is it now deserted by the
votaries genius though considerably altered and conducted ina
different manner it still however affords much amusement and
accommodation it was formerly well known by the appellation the
finish and was not opened till a late hour in the night and as at
the present moment is generally shut up between and o'clock
and reopened for the accommodation the market people at in the
morning the most respectable persons resident in the neighbourhood
assemble to refresh themselves after the labours the day with a glass
 ale spirits or wine as they draw no porter the landlord is a
pleasant fellow enough and there is a pretty neat dressing young lass
in the bar whom i believe to be his sister this is the house
house said bob why this is a deviation from the customary buildings
 london it appears to have no up stairs rooms
never mind that continued dashall there is room enough for us i
dare say and after your visit to the woolpack i suppose you can stand
smoke if you can't stand fire
by this time they had entered the carpenter's arms when turning short
round the bar they found themselves in a small room pretty well filled
with company enjoying their glasses and puffing their pipes in the
right hand corner sat an undertaker who having just obtained a victory
over his opposite neighbour was humming a stave to himself
indicative his satisfaction at the result the contest which it
afterwards appeared was for two mighty's while his opponent was
shrugging up his shoulders with a feeling a very different kind
it's no use said jemmy as they called him for you to enter
the lists along with me for you know very well i must have you at
last
and no doubt it will prove a good fit said an elderly shoemaker
 respectable appearance who seemed to command the reverence the
company for all us are subject to the pinch 
there's no certainty his assertion however replied the
unsuccessful opponent jemmy
surely not said another most emphatically taking a pinch 
snuff and offering it to the shoemaker for you know jemmy may come to
the finch before john
 mighty this high sounding title has recently been
given to a full glass ale the usual quantity what is
termed a glass being half a pint generally supplied in a
large glass which would hold more and which when filled is
consequently subjected to an additional charge
 to those who are in the habit frequenting the house
this gentleman will immediately be known as he usually
smokes his pipe there an afternoon and evening
with his friend and his pipe puffing sorrow away and with
honest old stingo still soaking his clay
with a certain demonstration before him the mortality 
human life he deposits the bodies his friends and
neighbours in the earth and buries the recollection them
in a cloud determined it should seem to verify the words
 the song that
the right life is to live and be jolly
his countenance and manners seldom fail to excite
risibility notwithstanding the solemnity his calling
and there can be little doubt but he is the finisher 
many after the finish he is however generally good
humoured communicative and facetious and seldom refuses
to see any person in company for a mighty usually
concluding the result with a mirthful ditty or a doleful
countenance according to the situation in which he is left
as a winner or a loser and in either case accompanied with
a brightness visage or a dull dismal countenance
indicative the event which sets description at defiance
and can only be judged by being seen
 surely not are words in such constant use by one
gentleman who is frequently to be met in this room that the
character alluded to can scarcely be mistaken he is partial
to a pinch snuff but seldom carries a box his own he
is a resident in the neighbourhood up to snuff and
probably like other men sometimes snuffy this however
without disparagement to his general character which is
that a respectable tradesman he is fond a lark a
bit gig and an argument has a partiality for good
living a man feeling and a dealer in felt who wishes
every one to wear the cap that fits him
 never mind continued jemmy i take my chance in this life
and sing toll de roll loll 
by this time our friends being supplied with mightiest joined in the
laugh which was going round at the witty sallies the speakers
it is possible i may go first said the undertaker resuming his pipe
and if i should i can't help it
surely not but i tell you what jemmy if you are not afraid i'll
see you for two more mightiest before i go and i summons you to shew
cause
d n your summons cried the former unsuccessful opponent 
the risible undertaker who at the word summons burst into a hearty
laugh in which he was immediately joined by all but the last speaker
the summons is a sore place said jemmy
surely not i did not speak to him i spoke to you sir and i have a
right to express myself as i please if that gentleman has an antipathy
to a summons am i to be tonguetied although he may sport with
sovereigns he must be accountable to plebeians and if i summons you to
shew cause i see no reason why he should interrupt our conversation
 d n your summons this as one the company
afterwards remarked was a sore place and uttered at a
moment when the irritation was strong on the affected part
the speaker is a well known extensive dealer in the pottery
staffordshire and glass line who a short time since in a
playful humour caught a sovereign tossed up by another
frequenter the room and passed it to a third the
original possessor sought restitution from the person who
took the sovereign from his hand but was referred to the
actual possessor but refused to make the application the
return the money was formally demanded the man 
porcelain pitchers and pipkin without avail in this
state things the loser obtained a summons against the
taker and the result as might be expected was compulsion
to restore the lost sovereign to the loving subject
together with the payment the customary expenses a
circumstance which had the effect causing great anger in
the mind the dealer in brittle wares whether he broke
any the valuable articles in his warehouse in consequence
has not been ascertained but it appears for a time to have
broken a friendship between the parties concerned such
breaches however are perhaps easier healed than broken or
cracked crockery
 surely not was reverberated round the room accompanied with
a general laugh against the interrupter who seizing the paper appeared
to read without noticing what was passing
the company was now interrupted by the entrance several strangers
and our two friends departed on their return homeward for the evening
chapter xvii
roam where you will o'er london's wide domains
the mind new source various feeling gains
explore the giddy town its squares its streets
the filtered eye still fresh attraction greets
here spires and towers in countless numbers rise
and lift their lofty summits to the skies
wilt thou ascend then cast thine eyes below
and view the motley groupes joy and woe
lo they whom heaven with affluence hath blest
scowl with cold contumely on those distrest
and pleasure's maze the wealthy caitiffs thread
while careworn merit asks in vain for bread
yet short their weal or woe a general doom
on all awaits oblivion in the tomb
 our heros next morning determined on a visit to their
hibernian friend and his aunt whom they found had not yet forgot the
entertainment at the mansionhouse and which still continued to be the
favorite topic conversation sir felix expressed his satisfaction
that the worthy citizens london retained with increasing splendor
their long established renown preeminent distinction in the art 
good living
and let us hope said dashall that they will not at any future
period be reduced to the lamentable necessity restraining the
progress epicurism as in the year when the lord mayor and
common council enacted a sumptuary law to prevent luxurious eating by
which it was ordered that the mayor should confine himself to seven
aldermen and sheriffs to six and the swordbearer to four dishes
at dinner or supper under the penalty forty shillings for each
supernumerary dish
a law rejoined the baronet which voluptuaries the present
times would find more difficult observance than any enjoined by the
decalogue
the squire suggested the expediency a similar enactment with a
view to productive results for were the wealthy citizens he
observed prohibited the indulgence luxurious eating under certain
penalties the produce would be highly beneficial to the civic treasury
the fine arts claiming a priority notice the party determined on
visiting a few the private and public exhibitions
london is now much and deservedly distinguished for the cultivation 
the fine arts the commotions on the continent operated as a hurricane
on the productions 
genius and the finest works ancient and modern times ave been
removed from their old situations to the asylum afforded by the wooden
walls britain many them have therefore been consigned to this
country and are now in the collections our nobility and gentry
chiefly in and about the metropolis
although france may possess the greatest number the larger works 
the old masters yet england undoubtedly possesses the greatest portion
 their firstrate productions which is accounted for by the great
painters exerting all their talents on such pictures as were not too
large to be actually painted by their own hands while in their larger
works they resorted to inferior assistance pictures therefore this
kind being extremely valuable and at the same time portable england
during the convulsions said he the
park at nightfall presented a very sombre aspect being so imperfectly
lighted as to encourage the resort the most depraved characters 
both sexes and although in several instances a general caption by
direction the police was made these nocturnal visitants yet
the evil still remained when a brilliant remedy at last was found by
entirely irradiating the darkness hitherto so favourable to the career
 licentiousness these lamps each at a short distance from the
other have been lately introduced stretching along the mall and
circumscribing the park they shed a noontide splendor on the solitude
 midnight they are lighted with gas and continue burning from
sunset to daybreak combining ornament with utility thus vice has been
banished from her wonted haunts and the park has become a respectable
evening promenade
this park continued the communicative dashall which is nearly two
miles in circuit was enclosed by king charles who planted the
avenues made the canal and the aviary adjacent to the birdcage walk
which took its name from the cages hung in the trees but the present
fine effect the piece ground within the railing is the fruit 
the genius the celebrated mr brown
 st james's park was the frequent promenade king
charles here he was to be seen almost daily unattended
except by one or two his courtiers and his favorite
greyhounds intermixing with his subjects in perfect
confidence their loyalty and attachment his brother
james one day remonstrating with him on the impolicy thus
exposing his person james rejoined his majesty take
care yourself and be under no apprehension for me my
people will never kill me to make you king
in more recent times mr charles townshend used every
morning as he came to the treasury to pass by the canal in
the park and feed the ducks with bread or corn which he
brought in his pocket for that purpose one morning having
called his affectionate friends the dickey dickey
duchies he found unfortunately that he had forgotten them
poor duchies he cried i am sorry i am in a hurry and
cannot get you some bread but here is sixpence for you to
buy some and threw the ducks a sixpence which one them
gobbled up at the office he very wisely told the story to
some gentlemen with whom he was to dine there being ducks
for dinner one the gentlemen ordered a sixpence to be
put into the body a duck which he gave charles to cut
up our hero surprised at finding a sixpence among the
seasoning bade the waiter send up his master whom he
loaded with epithets rascal and scoundrel and swore
bitterly that he would have him prosecuted for robbing the
king his ducks for said he gentlemen this very
morning did i give this sixpence to one the ducks in the
canal in st james's park
 the party now seated themselves on one the benches in the
mall opposite the spot where lately stood the chinese or pagoda bridge
tallyhoho had often animadverted on the absurdity the late inconvenient
and heterogeneous wooden structure which had been erected at a
considerable public expense its dangling nondescript ornaments and
tiresome acclivity and descent forty steps each what said he
notwithstanding the protection by sentinels this precious memento 
vitiated taste has it become the prey dilapidation
rather answered dashall premature decay its crazy condition
induced the sage authors its origin to hasten its destruction like
the cherokee chief who when the object his regard becomes no longer
useful buries him alive
contrasting the magnificent appearance the adjacent edifices as
seen from the park with one apparently very humble pretensions miss
macgilligan inquired to what purpose the shabby fabric was applied
and by whom occupied
that shabby fabric madam responded dashall is st james's
palace erected by henry viii in which our sovereigns england
have held their courts from the reign queen anne to that his late
majesty george iii 
 the state apartments now renovated comprehend six
chambers the first is the guard chamber at the top the
stairs this has been entirely repaired and on the right
hand there is a characteristic chimneypiece instead the
illshaped clumsy fireplace which previously disgraced this
approach to the grand rooms the next room continuing to
advance is the presence chamber this chamber has been
remodelled and a large handsome octagonal window
introduced this produces the best effect and has rendered
a gloomy room very light and cheerful the privy chamber
which forms the eastern the great suite that runs
from east to west parallel to the mall in the park and is
strictly speaking the immediate scene the court this is
entirely new from the foundation and is a continuation 
the old suite state apartments the chamber is noble
dimensions being nearly feet in length and having four
windows towards the garden and park beyond a magnificent
marble chimneypiece occupies the centre on the east 
the antidrawingroom and the drawingroom in which little
alteration appears except in the introduction splendid
chimneypieces statuary marble taken from the library 
queen caroline in the stable yard built by kent the
workmanship these is amazingly fine and the designs very
rich the throne is at the upper the drawing room no
 and from the chimney the room no the vista through
the middle doors the antidrawingrooms is about 
feet the coup d'oeil must be indescribably grand when
all the three apartments are filled with rank and beauty
the ceilings the principal rooms and are coved
upon handsome cornices carved and gilt this gives the
apartments a spacious and lofty appearance and there being
four large windows in each the whole suite is very
imposing the rooms are to be fitted with mirrors and a
noble collection the royal pictures over the chimney in
the drawingroom lawrence's splendid portrait george
 surrounded by the fine old carvings grinding
gibbons which many are preserved in the palace will bethe
principal object in the antidrawingroom a portrait 
the venerable george iii will occupy a similar station and
on each side will appear the victories which reflected the
highest lustre on his reign trafalgar and waterloo in the
privy chamber a portrait queen anne will be attended by
the great marlborough triumphs lisle and tourney
blenheim and other historical pieces other spaces will
exhibit a series royal portraits from the period the
founder the palace henry viii to the present era
including course some the most celebrated works 
holbein and vandyke the unrivalled charles on
horseback by the latter is among the number and the
gallery altogether must be inestimable even as a panorama
 the arts in england for three centuries on the whole
these state apartments when completed will not be
excelled if equalled by any others in europe holbein
whom we have just mentioned was a favourite henry viii
one day when the painter was privately drawing a lady's
picture for the king a nobleman forced himself into the
chamber holbein threw him down stairs the peer cried out
holbein bolted himself in escaped over the roof the
house and running directly to the king fell on his knees
and besought his majesty to pardon him without declaring
the offence the king promised to forgive him if he would
tell the truth immediately arrives the lord with his
complaint after hearing the whole his majesty said to the
nobleman you have behaved in a manner unworthy your
rank i tell you seven peasants i can make so many
lords but not one holbein be gone and remember this if
you ever presume to avenge yourself i shall look on an
injury you do to the painter as done to me
 the descendant o'brien was astonished and connecting her
ideas the internal show this palace with its outward appearance
doubted not secretly that it was far inferior to the residence informer
times her royal progenitor
probably guessing her thoughts dashall proceeded to observe that the
palace was venerable from age and in its interior decoration that it
fully corresponded in splendor with the regal purposes to which it had
been so long applied it is now however he added about to assume a
still more imposing aspect being under alterations and adornments
for the reception the court his present majesty which when
completed will render it worthy the presence the sovereign this
great empire
 the sole use made lately st james's palace is for purposes
 state in the southeastern wing the building was destroyed
by fire the state apartments were however uninjured and the court 
george the third and his queen was held here
on the right the palace the attention the party was next
attracted by marlborough house it was built in the reign queen anne
by the public at the expense l on part the royal gardens
and given by the queen and parliament on a long lease to the great
duke marlborough it is a handsome building much improved late
years and has a garden extending to the park and forms a striking
contrast to the adjoining palace st james's it is now the town
residence his royal highness prince leopold saxe coburg
our party now passed into st james'sstreet where miss macgilligan
whose certitude temper had been much softened by the politeness 
her friends during the morning's ramble mentioned that she had a visit
to make on an occasion etiquette and requesting the honour 
the gentlemen's company to dinner she was handed by the squire
 melvillehall with all due gallantry and obeisance into a
hackneychariot tom in the meanwhile noting its number in the
anticipation its ultimately proving a requisite precaution
the trio now left to their own pursuits lounged leisurely up st
james'sstreet and pausing at the caricature shop an incident occurred
which placed in a very favorable point view the baronet's promptitude
 reply and equanimity temper having had recourse to his glasses
lie stood on the pavement examining the prints unobservant any
other object when a porter with a load brushed hastily forward and
coming in contact with the baronet put him involuntarily by the
violence the shock to the left about face without the word either
 caution or command damn your spectacles at same time exclaimed
the fellow thank you my good friend rejoined sir felix it is not
the first time that my spectacles have saved my eyes
 remarking on this rencounter dashall observed that the
insolence these fellows was become really a public nuisance armed in
the panoply arrogance they assume the right the footway to the
ejection danger and frequent injury other passengers moving in a
direct line with loads that sometimes stretch on either side the width
 the pavement they dash onward careless whom they may run against
or what mischief may ensue i would not continued dashall class
them with beasts burthen and confine them to the carriageway 
the street like other brutes that description but i would have them
placed under the control some salutary regulations and humanized
under the dread punishment
the squire coincided with his friend in opinion and added by way 
illustration that it was only a few days since he witnessed a serious
accident occasioned by the scandalous conduct a porter the fellow
bore on his shoulders a chest drawers a corner which while he
forced his way along the pavement struck a young lady a stunning blow
on the head bringing her violently to the ground and falling against a
shop window one her hands went through a pane glass by which she
was severely cut thus sustaining a double injury either which might
have been attended with fatal consequences
the three friends had now gained the fashionable lounge bondstreet
whence turning into conduitstreet they entered limmer's coffeehouse
for the purpose closing by refreshment the morning's excursion
here dashall recognized an old acquaintance in the person an
eminent physician who after an interchange civilities resumed his
attention to the daily journals
in the same box with this gentleman and directly opposite sat another
whose health was apparently on the decline who finding that the
ingenious physician had occasionally dropped into this coffeehouse had
placed himself visavis the doctor and made many indirect efforts
to withdraw his attention from the newspaper to examine the index his
the invalid's constitution he at last ventured a bold push at once
in the following terms doctor said he i have for a long time
been very far from being well and as i belong to an office where i am
obliged to attend everyday the complaints i have prove very troublesome
to me and i would be glad to remove them the doctor laid
down his paper and regarded his patient with a steady eye while he
proceeded i have but little appetite and digest what i eat very
poorly i have a strange swimming in my head c in short after
giving the doctor a full quarter an hour's detail all
his symptoms he concluded the state his case with a direct
question pray doctor what shall i take the doctor in the act
 resuming the newspaper gave him the following laconic
prescription take why take advice
this colloquy and its ludicrous result having been perfectly audible
to the company present afforded considerable entertainment which
the manoeuvring invalid seemed in no degree willing to partake for
he presently made his exit without even thanking the doctor for his
gratuitous advice
 limner's hotel this justly esteemed hotel was much
frequented by the late unfortunate lord camelford entering
the coffeeroom one evening meanly attired as he often
was he sat down to peruse the papers the day soon after
came in a dashing fellow a firstrate blood who threw
himself into the opposite seat the same box with lord c
and in a most consequential tone hallowed out waiter
bring in a pint madeira and a couple wax candles and
put them in the next box he then drew to him lord cs
candle and set himself to read his lordship glanced at him
a look indignation but exerting his optics a little
more continued to decipher his paper the waiter soon reappeared
and with a multitude obsequious bows announced
his having completed the commands the gentleman who
immediately lounged round into his box lord camelford
having finished his paragraph called out in a mimic tone to
that mr waiter bring me a pair snuffers
these were quickly brought when his lordship laid down his
paper walked round to the box in which mrwas snuffed
out both the candles and leisurely returned to his seat
boiling with rage and fury the indignant beau roared out
waiter waiter waiter who the devil is this fellow that
dares thus to insult a gentleman who is he what is he
what do they call him lord camelford sir said the
waiter who lord camelford returned the former in a
tone voice scarcely audible horrorstruck at the
recollection his own impertinence and almost doubting
whether he was still in existence lord camelford what
have i to pay on being told he laid down his score and
actually stole away without daring to taste his madeira
 the repast ended the friends separated sir felix to rejoin
his august relative at their lodgings and arrange with her preparations
for the entertainment tom and bob and these two gentlemen also
returning homewards to dress for the important occasion
passing the house his tailor the baronet stept in and desired mr
snip to send to his lodgings any time in the course the evening for
the last new suit for the purpose alteration as had been already
pointed out
miss macgilligan had preceded her nephew in reaching home and gave
him on his arrival an appropriate and edifying lecture on a threefold
subject embracing petulancy respect to superiors and veneration
for the memory our ancestors
the baronet who never designed seriously to insult his aunt but merely
to have a byeblow at her prominent foible pride descent listened
with becoming deference to her dissertation which was interrupted
by the entrance his servant the same who on a certain
occasion confided to mother cummings the safety his master's
property the tailor's boy sir felix for the new suit your honor
ordered to be altered very well rejoined sir felix sure enough
mr snip is prompt in observance instructions let the lad have
the suit immediately this business having been despatched miss
macgilligan was about to resume her admonitory discourse when luckily
the arrival the expected guests prevented its continuance and it was
consequently postponed until a more favourable opportunity
 vide page 
dinner was shortly announced during which nothing occurred 
particular import when the exhilarating tuscan grape had superseded
the discarded viands miss macgilligan mentioned that she had been
grossly imposed upon by the driver the hackneychariot it seems
that conceiving jehu was exacting more than his fare the lady
presenting a handful silver told him to take it all if he thought
proper and the conscientious knight the whip had actually embraced
the offer in its literal acceptation and pocketing the money made the
best his way before she recovered from the surprise occasioned by
this iniquitous transaction
 iniquitous repeated the baronet by the powers folly
but there was no advantage taken at all at all and the man must
have been worse than an idiot had he rejected so liberal an offer
gramachree he might cry and thanks to the donor such opportunities
don't occur every day
appealing to her guests she had the mortification finding the
opinion her nephew supported certainly madam said dashall the
conduct the man in putting a construction not meant upon your word
was highly reprehensible yet i am afraid that redress is unavailable
a gift was implied though obviously not intended but impartially
speaking you tendered a donation and the man if not morally right
was legally justifiable in accepting it
while this case was under discussion the baronet chuckled at the
mischance his aunt and in defiance the admonition given him a
few hours before seemed more petulant less respectful and totally
irreverent his ancestors
in the enjoyment this triumph and asserting that he could not be
takenin even by the most artfully conducted manoeuvre he was struck
dumb by the information that mr snip the tailor had called for the new
suit the devil fly over the hill howth with him exclaimed the
astounded sir felix with a secret foreboding evil has he not had
the new suit hours ago
he says not sir answered the servant
where then in the name mystery rejoined the baronet are the
clothes gone to they were sent by his boy were they not
he denies sir responded the servant that he sent for the clothes
at all at all
soul my grandmother send in this snip a tailor instantaneously
dashall immediately surmised a fraud and the statement snip
converted suspicion into fact
mr snip repeated that he had not sent for the clothes and neither
did he keep a boy but he recollected that there was a lad in his shop
purchasing some trifling article at the time sir felix gave his address
and ordered the new suit to be sent for and there is no doubt added
snip that this young adept being thus put in the way successfully
practising a fraud gladly availed himself the opportunity and
obtained possession the clothes in my name but sir felix continued
mr snip it must have escaped your recollection when you
sanctioned the delivery the clothes that i had particularly
cautioned you when you first honoured me with your custom against your
sending to my house any articles apparel by pretended messengers from
me unless on the authority my own hand writing
i exonerate you said the baronet from censure and exempt you from
loss i have been swindled there is now no remedy so make me another
suit and by stricter vigilance we shall endeavour to avoid future
depredation
 this is amongst the inferior classes fraud daily
practised in the metropolis the following is one a
must rate description
swindling a case most ingeniously contrived and
successfully carried into execution on saturday last is
scarcely to be equalled on the records fraud it was
equal to that practised on rundle and bridge the jewellers
some time ago but the present case is only at the expense
 four costly gold watches the swindler who called
himself mr winter is rather above the middle size was
dressed in a brown frock coat wears long whiskers and is
well calculated for imposition in address and manner a
house in southamptonstreet strand occupied by mr holt
the barrister having been advertised to be let mr winter
called about it several times last week and he appointed
saturday last to call with some ladies when he could give a
final answer and the servants were desired if the
occupants were from home to shew the gentleman and his
party into the diningroom having secured this point mr
winter called upon mr ely a jeweller at the latter 
the week and after looking over some trifles in the shop
he desired that some ladies watches might be brought to his
residence no southamptonstreet at a certain hour on
saturday for inspection the swindler called some time
before the jeweller was expected and inquired if the ladies
who were to meet him there had called and being informed in
the negative he affected surprise and desired them to be
informed his arrival when they came he was shewn into
the front drawingroom but he preferred the adjoining room
and desired the servant to shew a gentleman who would call
into the front room and let him know when he arrived the
jeweller was to his time with the goods and mr winter paid
him a visit and after looking over the goods he selected
four watches worth l to shew the ladies in the next
room instead which he took his hat and walked off with
the watches after waiting till out patience the
jeweller rang the bell and the servant missed mr winter
who had promised her servitude the landlord his new tenant
and the jeweller his watches
 it was now miss macgilligan's turn to triumph but to the
surprise and relief her nephew she did not avail herself the
privilege sensible perhaps that the loss which site sustained was
occasioned by her own imprudence and that his misfortune might have
happened to those even the most guarded against deception she consoled
instead recriminating the most perfect unanimity now prevailed
between the two relatives and the evening passed on with increased
pleasure the unexpected migration the new suit led to conversation
on the frauds london when dashall justly observed that if the
ingenuity exemplified in depredation was exercised in honest industry
in place being now the pest many those men might have been the
ornaments society
chapter xviii
tho village delights may charm for a time
with hunting with cricket with trapball and such
the rambles in london are bangup and prime
and never can tire or trouble us much
tis a life variety frolic and fun
rove which way you will right or left up or down
all night by the gas and all day by the sun
sure no joys can compare with the joys the town
 our two friends in consequence some allusions made by
the company at the finish on a preceding day to a house great
theatrical celebrity in drurylane resolved on a visit the following
evening and it may here be necessary to introduce such our readers
as are not in the secret to the same
the harp opposite drurylane theatre is well known as the resort
 theatrical amateurs and professors but those who have not had an
opportunity visiting its interior can scarcely form an idea 
the mirth wit and humour constantly displayed within its walls the
circumstance here alluded to though not exactly introduced in point 
time is one which generally takes place once in three years viz the
election a mayor to represent the now city washington an event
which is attended with as much bustle interest and whimsicality
as a popular election for a member parliament the generality the
persons who are frequent visitors to the house are termed harmonious 
and by due qualification become citizens washington although we
cannot give a true and circumstantial history this ancient city we
doubt not our numerous readers will discover that its title is derived
from an important article in life commonly called lush the four wards
are also appropriately titled as symbolical the effects which are
usually produced by its improper application on entering the room
the first corner on the right hand is suicide ward and derives its
appellation from a society so named in which each member is bound by an
oath that however he might feel inclined to lay violent hands upon his
glass he would not lay violent hands upon his own existence
 the left hand corner has also a name as appropriate as its
neighbour being called poverty ward so termed from its vicinity to
the door and the ease with which a citizen whose tanner casey and
toggery are out repair may make his entree and exit without
subjecting himself to the embarrassing gaze and scrutiny his more
fortunate fellowcitizens juniper ward which is directly opposite to
poverty ward may in a moral point view be said to mark the natural
gradation rom the one to the other whether these wards are so placed
by the moral considerations the ingenious citizens or not we are at
present unable to learn but we have discovered that juniper ward is
so called in consequence a club consisting seven citizens who
bound themselves to meet every evening exactly on the spot taking each
upon himself to defray the expense blue ruin for the whole party
on each evening alternately in the corner directly opposite to suicide
ward is lunatic ward indicative no doubt the few steps there are
between the one and the other hence the four corner pillars this
ancient and honourable city are replete with moral instruction to the
wise and discriminating part society
 tanner case a pocket
 toggery cloathing
each these wards like the wards the city london has
its alderman and no doubt can be entertained their being ably
represented as well as their rights and privileges being well secured
and sustained a gentleman who is well known and highly respected for
his abilities and attentions as theatrical agent which character he has
sustained for many years is high bailiff and at proper periods issues
his writ in the following form
city washington to wit
the high bailiff having received a requisition to convene a meeting for
the purpose nominating aldermen to represent the different wards and
from them to elect a mayor for the above city for the year ensuing
 the high bailiff in pursuance thereof fixes saturday the d
december inst to nominate for the purpose aforesaid and from thence
proceed to the election which election is to continue till the
following monday being the th when the poll is to be closed
given under my hand this th day december signed f
sims high bailiff
washington hall
the election to commence at o'clock the poll to be closed at
halfpast 
after this official notice preparations are made in due form for the
election and in the fitting up the hustings the most skilful
and ingenious artists are selected from the several wards while the
candidates are employed in forming their committees and canvassing
their friends and fellowcitizens each them professing an intention
to intersect the city with canals sky blue to reduce the price 
heavy wet and to cultivate plantations the weed to be given away
for the benefit and advantage the community thereby to render
taxation useless and the comforts life compatible by all ranks and
degrees society to take the burthensome load civic state upon
themselves in order that their friends and neighbours may be free that
independence may become universal and that the suffrages the people
may be beyond controul nor can it be doubted but these professions
are made with as much sincerity in many a similar nature in larger
cities and in situations much greater importance
for quacks profess the nation's ills to cure
to mend small fortunes and set up the poor
and oft times neatly make their projects known
by mending not the public's but their own
the poor indeed may prove their watchful cares
that nicely sift and weigh their mean affairs
from scanty earnings nibbling portions small
as mice by bits steal cheese with rind and all
but why should statesmen for mechanics carve
what are they fit for but to work and starve
it is however proper to observe that in the city washington there
are no sinecures no placemen and pensioners to exhaust the treasury
honour is the grand inducement for the acceptance office and highly
honour'd are those who are fortunate enough to obtain the mark s 
distinction to which they aspire
 the oath administered upon such occasions is a most serious
and solemn nature which however notwithstanding the conscientious
scruples the voters must be taken with suitable gravity before they
can be permitted to poll being in substance nearly as follows
i a b do swear that i have been an inhabitant the city 
washington for the space years and that i have taken within its
walls pots porter glasses jacket and smoked pipes the
blanks are filled in according to circumstances that is to say one
pot heavy wet one glass juniper and one loading weed at
least annually have been the cause such acts in others or have been
present when such acts have been performed and that i have not polled
at this election
this oath is sworn with all due solemnity by kissing the foot a
broken glass and the vote is then recorded
tom and bob who had so little previous intimation this important
event were informed as they proceeded to the scene action by
a friend one the candidates that the election was strongly
contested between sir william sims the son the worthy high bailiff
sir benjamin rosebud jessamine sweetbread sir peter paid and
peregrine foxall the silvertoned orator strongly supported by the tag
rag and bobtail club sir frederick atkinson introduced and proposed by
the marquis huntley a well known sporting character from the county
 surrey and mr alderman whitman washington notoriety the door
 the house was well guarded by the posse comitatus armed with staves
emblematical the renowned city to which they belonged and decorated
with the favors the different candidates by whom they were employed
or whose interest they espoused the staves instead the crown were
surmounted by quartern measures and produced a most striking and novel
effect as they appeared to be more reverenced and respected than that
gaudy bauble which is a representative royalty
at the moment our friends entrance large bodies voters were
brought up by canvassing parties from the surrounding habitations with
colours flying and were introduced in succession to poll and as time
was fast escaping every one was active in support his favourite
candidate all was bustle and anxiety and tom and bob approached the
hustings with two chimneysweepers a hackneycoachman and three light
bearers alias linkcarriers from covent garden theatre having polled
for sir william sims who very politely returned thanks for 
the honour conferred on him standing room was provided for them by the
inhabitants lunatic ward who it should seem like others under the
influence the moon have their lucid intervals and who upon this
occasion displayed a more than usual portion sanity mingled with
good humour and humanity
in this quarter the city where our friends expected to find
distracted or at least abstracted intellect they were very pleasingly
disappointed at discovering they were associated with reasonable and
intelligent beings although some them fatigued by their exertions
during the election were so strongly attacked by somnus that
notwithstanding the bustle with which they were surrounded they
occasionally dropped into the arms the drowsy god and accompanied
the proceedings with a snore till again roused to light and life by
some more wakeful inhabitant
at the appointed time the high bailiff announced the election closed
and after an examination the votes declared the choice to have
fallen on sir william a circumstance which drew forth a unanimous
burst approbation long loud and deep which in a few moments being
communicated to those without this was as cordially and as vociferously
answered by anxious and admiring crowds
the influx citizens upon the event being known to hear the speeches
 the different candidates choaked up every avenue to the hustings
and beggars all description the inimitable pencil a hogarth could
hardly have done justice to the scene and a common hall the city 
london might be considered a common fool to it every voter had a right
established that right and enjoyed it here stood the welldressed
corinthian in his bangup toggery alongside a man in armour one
 the braziers company armed with a potlid and a spit and decorated
with a jackchain round his neck there stood a controller the prays
a jarvey in close conversation with one the lighters the world
with his torch in hand a flue maker in one corner was endeavouring
to explain a distinction between smoke and gas to a lamplighter who
declared it as his opinion that the city washington at all times
a luminous and deservedly revered city had had more light thrown upon
it that election by the introduction the link carriers than it ever
had before and likewise that his dissertation on smoke and gas was not
worth one puff from his pipe
 in the midst this bustle noise and confusion it was sometime
before the high bailiff could obtain silence when sir william
made his appearance on the hustings and in language well suited for the
occasion declared the heartfelt gratitude he entertained for the high
and distinguished honour so handsomely conferred upon him with
his determination never to lose sight the invaluable rights and
privileges his constituents assuring them they were welcome
to indulge themselves with any thing the house afforded he next
complimented his opponents on the very gentlemanlike way in which
the election had been conducted and alluded most emphatically to the
introduction those voters who endeavour to lighten the darkness
 the world the linkcarriers who by their manners and conduct had
become on that occasion as it were links a chain which in point 
friendship good humour and independence he sincerely hoped would
never be broken rapturous applause followed this speech which
notwithstanding the almost overpowering load gratitude with which the
speaker was burthened was given with good emphasis and corresponding
effect
the other candidates returned thanks to those their fellowcitizens
who had supported their interest and no one seeming inclined to call
for a scrutiny sir william took the official oath and was invested
with the cloathing magistracy which being done mr alderman whitman
arose to address the mayor
the well known ability usually displayed by this gentleman his
patriotic zeal and undeviating integrity commanded immediate silence
while he informed the chief magistrate a circumstance which had
recently occurred and which left one the wards unrepresented by a
worthy alderman who in consequence accepting an office in the
board controul had by the laws washington vacated his seat an
explanation being demanded it appeared that the worthy alderman had
become a deputy manager a country theatre and consequently must be
considered under the board controul it was therefore necessary he
should at least be reelected before he could be allowed to continue in
the distinguished station alderman this point being agreed to the
situation was declared vacant and a time appointed for the election
 the official business the election being over harmony and
conviviality became the order the night foaming bowls and flowing
glasses decorated the tables many the citizens withdrawing to rest
after their labours made room for those who remained and every one
seemed desirous to
wreath the bowl
with flowers soul
the brightest wit can find us
we'll take a flight
towards heav'n tonight
and leave dull earth behind us
the song the toast the sentiment followed each other in rapid
succession mirth and good humour prevailed and time while he
exhausted himself appeared to be inexhaustible the beams wit
the lively sallies humour and the interchange good fellowship
eradicated the glass in its circulation and doubly enhanced its
contents and in amusements so truly congenial with the disposition 
the hon tom dashall and his cousin they joined till after four o'clock
in the morning thus rendering themselves true and devoted citizens 
washington when they sallied forth tolerably well primed for any lark
or spree which chance might throw in their way it was a fine morning
and while the shopkeepers and tradesmen were taking their rest the
market gardeners and others were directing their waggons and carts to
covent garden
now said the hon tom dashall we will just take a turn round the
garden and a stroll down drurylane for a walk will do us no harm
after our night's amusement and we can hardly fail to find subjects
worthy observation though in all probability we are too early to
realize all the poet's description a market
a market's the circle for frolic and glee
where tastes all kinds may be suited
the dasher the quiz and the up to all he
pluck sprees from the plants in it rooted
if the joker or queer one would fain learn a place
where they'd wish for a morning to lark it
they need go no further than just shew their face
in that region mirth a large market
 the streets that surround the theatres and which an evening
are thronged with the elegant equipage the visitors were now filled
with carts waggons and other vehicles various denominations for
conveyance the marketable commodities to and from the place sale
here and there were groupes irishmen and basketwomen endeavouring
to obtain a load and squabbling with assiduous vociferations for the
first call
this said tom is the largest market for vegetables we have in the
metropolis and supplies numerous retail dealers with their stock in
trade who assemble here early in the morning to make their bargains
and get them home before the more important business the day that
 selling commences while tom was explaining thus briefly to his
cousin aloud laugh attracted their attention and drew them to a part
 the market where a crowd was collected to witness a squabble between
a jew orange merchant and a pork butcher
 although the hon tom dashall hurried his cousin from the
scene altercation at the time its occurrence they
enjoyed a hearty laugh at the following report the facts
which appeared in one the morning papers shortly
afterwards
ephraim versus stewart
this was a proceeding in limine by which the plain till
sought reparation for violence done to his religious
scruples and bodily health by the defendant inasmuch as he
the plaintiff being a jew on wednesday the th day 
this month in the forenoon in the parish st paul
covent garden did with malice aforethought knock him down
with a pig's head contrary to the statute and against the
peace our sovereign lord the king c
both plaintiff and defendant pleaded each for himself no
counsel being employed on either side
ephraim ephraim deposed that he is by profession an orangemerchant
carrying on his business in covent garden market
that the defendant richard stewart is a dealer in pork and
poultry in the said market and that he the said richard
stewart on the day and time then stated did thrust a pig's
face against his cheek with such violence as to throw him
backwards into a chest oranges whereby he sustained
great damage both in body mind and merchandize plaintiff
stated moreover that he had previously and on sundry
occasions forewarned the said richard stewart it was
contrary to the tenets his religion to come in contact
with pork and yet nevertheless he the said richard did
frequently and from time to time intrude pork upon his
attention by holding it up aloft in the market and
exclaiming aloud ephraim will you have a mouthful all
this he humbly submitted betokened great malice and
wickedness in the said richard and he therefore besought
the magistrate to interpose the protection the law in his
behalf
the magistrate observed that he was astonished a person 
mr stewart's appearance and respectability should be guilty
 such conduct and having explained to him that the law
afforded equal protection to the professors every
religion called upon him for his defence
may it please your worship said mr richard stewart who
is a well fed man a jolly and pleasing countenance
may it please your worship i keeps a shop in covent garden
market and have done so any time these ten years and mr
ephraim's stand is next to mine now your worship on
wednesday morning i'd a hamper o'pork sent up out
hertfordshire and so i opened the hamper and at the top
 it lay a nice head and i takes it and holds it up and
says i heres a bountiful head says i did ever any body see
such a handsome un and sure enough your worship it was the
most bootiftd as ever was and would a done any body's heart
good to see it it was cut so clean the quarter drawing
his finger closely across his own neck and was so short
i'the snout and as white as a sheet it was your worship
remarkably handsome and so i said says i look here did
ever tiny body see such a picture holding it up just in
this manner with that ah says mr ephraim says he now
my dream's out i dreamt last night that i saw two pig's
heads together and there they are meaning my head and
the pig's head your worship well i took no notice o'that
but i goes me gently behind him and slides the pig's head
by the side his head claps my own o the other side all
on a row with the pig's in the middle your worship and
says i to the folks says i now who'll say which is the
honestest face the three with that your worship all
the folks fell a laughing and i goes myself quietly back
again to a stall but poor ephraim he fell in such a
passion lord lord to see what a pucker he were in he
danced and he capered and he rubbed his whiskers though i
verily believe the pig's head never touched him and he
jumped and he fidgeted about all as one as if he was mad
till at last he tumbled into the orange chest your worship
 his own accord as it were and that's the long and the
short it your worship as my neighbours here can
specify
his worship having listened attentively to those
conflicting statements decided that the defendant had acted
indecently in insulting the religious feelings the
plaintiff though at the same time the affair was hardly
worth carrying to the sessions and therefore he would
recommend the plaintiff to be satisfied with an apology
the defendant expressed the greatest willingness to
apologize for says he i have axed another jew what
could make mr ephraim in such a passion and he told me
your worship that if you get a rale jew and rub him with a
bit o'pork it's the greatest crime as ever was
plaintiff and defendant then retired and the
matter was compromised
 the israelite appeared to be in a great rage swore he
would have revenge his insulting neighbour and pull him up the
exasperation the jew afforded much merriment to the spectators who
seemed to enjoy his aggravation our friends however had arrived
too late to discover the cause and although not very particular about
discovering themselves amid the mob conceived it most prudent to move
onward without inquiry for as tom observed if we ask any questions
we are sure to be told lies they then passed through the market made
their way up jamesstreet to long acre and thence to drurylane
illustration pagejpg drury lane
the watchmen were just leaving their stations with an intention to
partake what they had all night been endeavouring to deprive others
and the humbler ranks society were preparing for the business the
day while the batter'd beau the clean'd out buck and the dissipated
voluptuary were occasionally to be seen gliding from holes and corners
and scampering home with less wisdom in their heads and less money in
their purses than when they left here was to be seen the city showman
hastening away from his dulcinea to get down his master's shutters
before the gouty old gentleman should be able to crawl down stairs
there the dandy half dressed and more than half seas over buttoning
his toggery close round him to keep out the damp air the morning
affecting to sing
be gone dull care
slipped along as he supposed unobserved between duster scavengers
fluefakers gardeners fishfags and bricklayer's labourers to refit
and put himself in a situation to recount the adventures the night
at one door stood a shivering group halfstarved chimneysweepers
rending the air with their piercing cries sweep occasionally
relieved by a few hearty dns bestowed upon the servant that she
did not come down in order to let a diminutive urchin yet up the flue
leaning against a post at the corner the street was an overdone
irishman making a bargain with pugnosed peg a sort halfbred
pinafore cyprian whose disappointments during the night induced her to
try at obtaining a morning customer the hibernian was relating the ill
usage he had been subjected to and the necessity he had making a
hasty retreat from the quarters he had taken up while bet brill on
her road to billingsgate was blowing him up for wearing odd boots and
being a hod man blowing a cloud sufficient to enliven and revive the
whole party
 poor fellow said tom it would be a charity to pop him into
a rattler and drive him home and do you see he is standing close to
a mud cart the delicate drippings which are gently replenishing his
otherwise empty pockets
be aise said pat murphy the hodman ain't he an irish gentleman
ain't i a gentleman from ireland and ain't it lit and proper and
right and just as well as gentlemanly that two gentlemen should go
together so come along peg we'll just take a taste the cratur
drink success to the lads shelley and put the matter in its right
shape with this pugnosed peg seized him by one arm and the last
orator by the other and in a short time they entered a sluice in the
neighbourhood which enclosed the party from view
turning from the group which they had been paying attention to they
were suddenly attracted by a female purveyor for the stomach who was
serving out her tea coffee and saloop from a boiling cauldron and
handing with due complaisance to her customers bread and butter which
was as eagerly swallowed and devoured by two duster who appeared to
relish their delicate meal with as much appetite and gout as the
pampered palate a city alderman would a plate turtle the figure
 the lady whose commodities were thus desirable and refreshing to the
hungry dustcollectors struck bob at the first view as having something
matronly and kind about it
these persons said tom are really useful in their vocation and
while they provide a wholesome beverage for the industrious are rather
deserving approbation than censure or molestation the latter
however they are frequently subjected to for the kids lark in
their moments revelry think lightly such poor people's stock in
trade and consider it a prime spree to upset the whole concern
without caring who may be scalded by the downfall or how many their
fellowcreatures may go without a breakfast and dinner in consequence
but do you mark the other woman behind her
i do said bob and it is impossible to view them both without
noticing the striking contrast they form to each other
 your observations are just continued tom that is an old
beldame the neighbourhood in search the poor unhappy girl who has
just taken the irishman in tow an encourager all that is vicious and
baneful in society
i could almost judge that from her features replied bob though i do
not pretend to much skill in physiognomy
a debauched body and a vitiated mind are perceptible in her face and
having remained on the town till these were too visible for her to hope
for a continuance she is now a tutoress others to make the most 
those with whom they promiscuously associate she furnishes the finery
and shares the plunder it is however a melancholy and disgusting
picture real life in london and merely deserves to be known in order
to be avoided for there is no species villainy to which persons 
her stamp
 whom it is to be hoped there are but few cried tallyhoho
interrupting him
for the sake human nature replied shalt it is to be hoped so
but there is no species villainy to which they will not stoop 
 the hon tom dashall's observations on this subject are
but too strikingly exemplified by a case heard at worshipstreet
police office a short time back in which jemima
matthews was charged with conduct which excited astonishment
at the depravity human nature one the parish
constables spitalfields stated he proceeded to the
residence the prisoner in upper catostreet and found
the wretch at the bar surrounded by eight children while a
supper consisting a variety meats and vegetables was
making ready on the fire three children frederick clark
john clark and john bailey were owned by their parents
the children seemed so much under the controul this
infamous woman that they were afraid to tell the truth
until she was removed from the bar little bailey then said
they were daily sent out to steal what they could and bring
it home in the evening when they could get nothing else
they stole meat from the butchers and vegetables from the
greengrocers the woman kept a pack cards by which she
told their fortunes whether they would succeed or be
caught by the officers mr sway observed that since he
had attended the office he never witnessed a case so
much iniquity the prisoner was remanded for further
examination and the magistrate intimated he should desire
the parish to prosecute her for the misdemeanor in exciting
these children to commit felonies
 at this moment their attention was suddenly called to another
subject by a loud huzza from a combination voices at no great
distance from where they then were and in a few minutes a considerable
concourse duster and others appeared in view
there is something in the wind said dashall we must have a look at
these gentry for there is frequently some humour among them
i hope replied bob they have not overturned the dustcart in the
wind for i am apprehensive in such a case we should scarcely have eyes
to view their frolics
tom laughed at the ready turn his cousin and remarking that all
flesh was dust proceeded towards the increasing party here they soon
found out that as a venerable son the fantailedhat fraternity
described it a screw was loose
perhaps inquired bob it is the inchpin why aye mayhap as how
that there may be the case for aught i knows about it howsomever i'll
tell you all about it first and foremost you must know that dick nobs
lives down here in charlesstreet and dick nobs has got a wife now
she is the devil's own darling and dick is a match for her or the devil
himself come from wherever he may but as good a fellow as ever lapped
up a pail full watergruel and so you must know as how dick has this
here very morning been found out in bed with another man's wife the
other man is a nightman and rubbishcarter what lives in the same
house with dick so this here man being out all night at a job dick
gets lusty and so help me he finds his way steady enough into
that there man's bed and when that there man comes home my eyes what a
blow up there lays dick nobs fast asleep in the man's wife's arms so
he kicks up a row dick shews fight and the man comes and tells us all
about it so we are going to try him for a misdemeanor and he can't
help himself no how whatsomedever
tom was alive to the story and in a few minutes the culprit was
conducted to a neighbouring publichouse tried before a whole bench 
the society cast and condemned to undergo the usual sentence in
such cases made and provided entitled burning shame and active
preparations were making by those the fraternity without to carry
into immediate execution the sentence pronounced by those within
 the offender was decorated with a bunch christmas in his
hat and two large carrots in the front to represent horns in this
manner he was mounted on the brawny shoulders four his companions
preceded by the crier the court another fustian with a bell which
he rung lustily and at intervals proclaimed the crime which the
culprit had been found guilty after the crier followed eight more
 the brotherhood two and two their hats ornamented with bunches
 holly and a burning candle in the front each hat then came the
culprit carried as already described with a pot heavy wet in one
hand and a pipe tobacco in the other which he occasionally smoaked
stooping forward to light it at one the candles in the fantail hats
 his two front supporters the rear this ludicrous procession was
brought up by several other duster and coalheavers and their ladies
the procession set out from charlesstreet down drurylane great
queenstreet wildstreet and round clare market followed by an
immense crowd which kept increasing as they went and nearly rendered
the streets impassable two collectors were appointed one on each side
 the street and were very active in levying contributions among
the spectators to defray the expenses they stopped at several
publichouses where they quaffed off oceans heavy wet and numerous
streamlets old jamaica and then returned to headquarters in
charlesstreet where the offence was drowned in drink and they and
their ladies passed the remainder the evening as happy as beer and
gin rum and tobacco could make them
having witnessed a considerable part this ceremonious proceeding
and been informed the intended finale our friends who began to
feel somewhat uncomfortable for want refreshment and rest proposed
returning home and having thrown themselves into a hack they in a
short time arrived at piccadilly
chapter xix
if in real life's chapter you e'er tinct a blank
tis yourself and you only you justly can thank
for to him who is willing there's no need to stand
since enough may be found twixt mile and the strand
to instruct to inform to disgust or invite
to deplore to respect to regret or delight
tis in london where unceasing novelty grows
always fresh and in bloom like the opening rose
but if to the rose we its sweetness compare
fis as freely confess'd many thorns gather there
and if to avoid the latter you're prone
tis at least quite as well where they are should be known
 the arrival at piccadilly turned out to be truly agreeable
to our friends who were scarcely dressed and seated at the
breakfasttable before they were surprised by the unexpected appearance
 an old friend whose company and conversation had upon many occasions
afforded them so much pleasure and information this was no other than
sparkle
my dear boy said the hon tom dashall you are welcome to the scene
 former gratifications how is your better half and all friends in
the country any increase in the family why you look as healthy as
hygeia and as steady as old time
i confess replied sparkle you ask so many questions upon important
subjects in one breath that i am quite deficient wind to answer them
seriatim you must therefore take an answer in two words all's right
enough replied tom then i am content but how what are you in
town alone
you shall know all in time but don't drive on too hard i am glad to
meet you again in the regions fun frolic and humour which i
doubt not there is as there always was a plentiful stock glad to see
you both in good health and tiptop spirits i have only come to passa
fortnight with you and as i intend to make the utmost use every
minute the time don't let us waste in empty words what would be
better employed in useful deeds
 useful deeds reechoed tom useful deeds that savours 
reflection i thought you were fully aware it is an article considered
 little value in the labyrinths london but since you are become
as i may venture to presume a useful man what may be the objects upon
which you propose to practise your utility
still the same i find tom all life spirit and gaiety nothing like
a hit and i suppose you now think you have a palpable one never mind
i am not easily disconcerted therefore you may play off the artillery
 your wit without much chance obtaining a triumph but however in
plain words i expect to be a happy father in about another month
o ho said tom then you are really a useful member society and
i suppose are merely come up to town for the purpose picking up a
little more useful information and instruction how to perform the part
 papa
nay replied sparkle i could hardly expect to obtain such from you
i must therefore be excused and acquitted all such intentions but
joking apart how are you devoted
to you replied tallyhoho who was much pleased by this accession to
their society
then continued sparkle lend me all the assistance in your power
when did you see our old friend merrywell
the last time i saw him was in a place safety studying the law and
taking lessons from its professors in the priory
we must find him replied sparkle so if you are not engaged come
along and i will relate the circumstances which induce this search as
we proceed
to this proposal tom and bob readily acceding the party were quickly on
their way towards abbot's park
 you must know said sparkle that merry well's uncle in
the country having received some information upon the subject his
confinement probably very highly coloured has since his release
withdrawn his patronage and support so that the poor fellow has been
without supplies for some time past and i am at a loss to conjecture
by what means he is now working the oracle for a subsistence his uncle
however is in the last stage a severe illness with little chance
 recovery and as i apprehend there is but little time to spare i
intend if possible to find our old acquaintance start him for his
relative's residence in hope that he may arrive in time to be in at the
death and become inheritor his estate which is considerable and
may otherwise be apportioned among persons for whom he has had but
little or no regard while living
the object in view is a good one said dashall and i sincerely hope
we shall succeed in our endeavours
passing down st james'sstreet sparkle was quickly recognized by many
 his old acquaintances and friends and congratulated upon his return
to the scenes where they had in company with him enjoyed many a lark
and invitations came in as fast upon nim as the moments life were
fleeting away for the present however all engagements were
declined till the principal object his journey to london should be
accomplished and after inquiries about old friends and observations
upon the passing occurrences the moment were over they proceeded on
their way westminster bridge was the precise line direction for them
to pursue and as fortune would have it they had scarcely arrived at
the foot it before they discovered merrywell bustling along in
an opposite direction he however appeared rather inclined to pass
without recognition or acknowledgment when sparkle turning close upon
him gave him a hearty tap on the shoulder which made him as it were
involuntarily turn his head
well met said sparkle i want you
at whose suit sir was the immediate inquiry
to suit yourself was a reply as quickly given
zounds said merrywell i had little idea being tapped on the
shoulder by an old friend but are you indeed in earnest
certainly i am and can't be refused but if you should be pinched
for bail i think i have two friends with me who will do the needful
introducing tom and bob
i see how it is continued merrywell and have no objection to a
joke but i can't bear to have it carried too far how d'ye do how
d'ye do can't stop in a devil a hurry full business
 zounds said tom you are almost as bad as the man who
having married a wife could not come but if i may be so bold whither
away so fast
to westminster hall the sessions is on must go law is like the tide
it stays for none adieu
we cannot part thus said sparkle i have come some miles in search
 you and cannot afford to be played with now
then accompany me to westminster hall and i will be at your service
if not replied sparkle i shall enter a special detainer against
you so come along
they now entered westminster hall where merry well having disposed 
some briefs and other papers into the hands a counsellor preparatory
to a cause coming on
there continued he now i am at your service
then tell me said sparkle what you are at
first inquired merry well let me know what is your object in asking
such a question
this being briefly explained together with the absolute necessity there
was for his leaving town without delay
now said he i am at liberty to give you a sketch circumstances
which have befallen me since i saw you last
come then said dashall we will proceed to piccadilly spend a
comfortable afternoon and ship you off by the mail from the white horse
cellar at eight o'clock
with all my heart was the reply well now you must understand i ama
sort dabbler in professions i was liberated from the high wall
 the priory by the insolvent debtor's act and since the unfortunate
representation to the old boy which deprived me the needful
supplies i have tried my hand in three different ways
and which are they
love law and literature continued merry well
a very pretty combination said dashall and are you able to make
them blend comfortably together
 nothing more easy in the world in the first place a lady has
taken a fancy to me which fancy i am willing to indulge in return for
which she provides me with every indulgence i profess to be principal
in the office a lawyer established practice who suffers me to
share in the profits such business as i can obtain in the way 
literature i have as yet done but little though i am encouraged to hope
much from the success others indeed i am told if i can but write
libels for john bull i may make a rapid fortune
and when so made said sparkle i shall wish you well with it but i
think the speculation i have already named much more likely to turn out
equal to your wishes and more consonant with your feelings than the
pursuit either those you have mentioned
there i agree perfectly with you and if i can make all right with the
old gentleman a fig for all the rest my occupations but you know i
always liked independence and if i could not get a fortune ready made
i had a desire to be the architect one i should raise for myself
why i know you have generally borne the character a man genius
yes and a deal my character did for me after quitting the walls why
man i happened to hear a vacancy in a city parish school for which
i ventured to conceive myself duly qualified and therefore determined
to make application to the churchwardens one whom had the character
 being a man great power and was said to be the first in his line
in the three kingdoms away i posted full hope and expectation
 becoming a second caleb quoted not doubting but salary and
circumstances would turn out exactly to my wish
but i thought you liked independence said tallyhoho
rather too much to engage in that concern was the reply as you will
hear presently upon tracing out this gentleman who bore so strong a
recommendation to particular notice you may guess my surprise upon
finding purveyor sausages in gold letters over his door
dashall burst into an irresistible laugh and was most cordially joined
by sparkle and tallyhoho who were now strongly interested in the result
 merrywell's account
when i arrived continued merry well this patron was reading the
newspaper which he threw down immediately upon my entrance having
mistaken me for a customer
 servant sir said he pulling down his greasy
waistcoat i am come sir said i to make some inquiry
concerning a vacant schoolmastership oh there again resumed the
sausagemaking churchwarden vy you are the seventeenth fellow that
has been here today a bothering me about this plaguy vacancy how do
you read you'll have a trial before me and my brother representative 
this parish and my spouse will also attend the reading bouts now if
so be as you minds your hits why then may be you'll be the domini but
mind you i don't like your sonorous voices and my spouse she knows
things quite as well as i do she wants a great deal action so
only you mind loud and sonorous and plenty muscular motion for my
spouse that's the way to win but i haven't any time to talk to you
now you must call an evening when i am more at leisure and then
i'll explain so move off now sir move off for i sees a customer
coming servant maun flesh and blood could bear no more and
so so what said sparkle did you knock him down in the midst
 his own sausages
no no i knew too much the law for that but i cut the
churchwarden and bolted from the sausageshop determined to embrace
law physic or divinity in preference to cutting
the rumps
 little schoolboy jackie
the study the law was rather compulsory than voluntary for during
my residence in the college i was under the necessity devoting some
part my time to though i felt no great partiality for it and you
know law is law and as in such and so forth and hereby and aforesaid
provided always nevertheless notwithstanding law is like a country
dance people are led up and down in it till they are tired law is like
a surgery there are a great many terrible cases in it it is
also like physic they that take least it are best off law is like
a homely gentlewoman very well to follow law is like a scolding wife
very bad when it follows us law is like a new fashion people are
bewitched to get into it it is also like bad weather most people are
glad when they get out it
 i believe that sincerely cried the hon tom dashall for i
think there are instances enough in which law has nothing at all to do
with justice
 this remark the hon tom dashall is admirably
illustrated by the following statement
twelve people in one bail bond fob ten pounds there
are very few instances delinquency which we have
stated that will stagger the belief the fair
practitioner because they know such transactions are
possible their only surprise is the impunity with which
they are committed mixed with some regret that the
profession is so contaminated the species peculation
we have now to submit to our readers is singular nature
for we know not whether folly impudence or infamy has the
greater share in the transaction we will therefore leave
our readers to judge as to the statement the fact it
is impossible we can err as we were concerned for the
defendants and the case singular as it is was literally
and accurately thus one those unfortunate females who
contribute to the existence a miscreant crew bawds
milliners hairdressers tallywomen and many other
reptiles the same class was arrested for ten pounds at
the house the celebrated or more properly speaking
the notorious mrs johnson jermynstreet the
attorney accompanied the officer and it happened that a
young gentleman connected with a bankinghouse great
respectability was present whom the attorney directed to
take in a bail bond with the ladyabbess herself but as
they were not sufficiently responsible ten more the
cyprian tribe all nuns the same convent were likewise
required to execute this bond course they complied
the attorney after having made the parties acquainted
with the great favour he had shewn them and the vast
responsibility he had taken upon himself required no more
than two guineas for the officer and himself telling them
he would give them information when any thing further was to
be done instead which he took an assignment sued out
process prepared declarations and served the parties
the gentleman rather alarmed at the idea the
circumstance being known desired us to pay the debt and
costs for that purpose we applied to the attorney and to
our astonishment we were informed that the costs amounted to
thirty pounds for that there were twelve defendants the
reader cannot suppose that any thing further could pass upon
such a preposterous subject than giving notice an
application to the court to set aside the proceedings on
our return home we found eleven the defendants
consisting the old brood hen and her chickens each with
a copy the process in her hand the business now most
certainly put on the appearance some costs we again
applied to the attorney and by way cutting it short
offered him five pounds but he like many others who rely
on the integrity and propriety their practice disdained
a compromise or abridgement his lawful fees and he was
hardy enough to suffer the application it is almost
needless to say the proceedings were set aside we have
forebode to mention the name the attorney on account 
the misery in which this dreadful transaction has involved
him a misery which amply atones for his offences and
deprives him the power ever offending again as an
attorney far be it from us then to sink him deeper in the
gulph wretchedness we kick not the dead lion it is
athletic triumphant villany against which we wage war
 by this time they were arrived in piccadilly where they sat
down to a cheerful refreshment and proceeded to make arrangements
for merry well's departure previous to this however dashall and his
cousin had an engagement to keep with their hibernian friends which
particulars will appear in the next chapter
chapter xx
all hail to the day the tutelar saint
old george not the king but the prince brave fellows
and champion england by providence sent
to slay a fierce dragon as histories tell us
and hail to the king the first isle on earth
his fame with st george and the dragon who blending
has chosen to celebrate this as his birth
the day all others good fortune portending
away then with care let us haste to the park
where buckinghamhouse will exhibit a levy
resplendent in rank youth and beauty and hark
hoarse cannon announce both the birthday and levee
reverberate then in each seaport the roar
and wave england's standard on high from each steeple
and skip from the oiling each ship to the shore
and joyfully dance on dry land with the people
 that we may not be accused plagiarism we acknowledge
ourselves indebted for the hyperbole contained in the last
two lines these introductory stanzas to an original
recommendation for a proper display rapture as
contained in the following couplet by one peter er wherein
he very humanely invites all the vessels belonging to great
britain to strand themselves out joy for the accession 
james i
let subjects sing bells ring and cannons roar
and every ship come dancing to the shore
the morning st george's day was ushered in as the
appointed anniversary his majesty's birth by all the
churchbells the metropolis the waving the royal
standard from the steeples the display the colours 
all nations by the vessels in the thames and cumberland
mentions in his memoirs that when his father the bishop
revisited his estate in ireland an affectionate rustic hit
upon an ingenious mode shewing his happiness by leaping
from a tree and breaking his leg we do not find that any
 his majesty's loving subjects in the park on st george's
day followed the example the irish rustic
illustration pagejpg st george's day
other manifestations affection by a grateful people to the best 
sovereigns
the sky was overcast the morning lower'd
and heavily in clouds brought on the day
 but despite wind or wet female curiosity must be gratified
miss judith macgilligan had some time previous to this auspicious
day expressed a desire to witness the gay and brilliant assemblage
 company in progress to the levee and tom and bob having gallantly
volunteered their services on this important occasion they now sallied
forth just as the park and tower guns were thundering the announcement
 festivity and joining sir felix o'o'grady and his aunt at their
lodgings the party immediately moved onward to the scene action
already had royalty taken wing and dignified with his presence the late
maternal palace before our pedestrians reached the park to the great
disappointment miss macgilligan who however consoled herself with
the hope being able to obtain a glimpse monarchy as his majesty
passed on his return to carltonhouse
the baronet in the meanwhile was in a reverie which at last broke out
in the following rhapsody
oh blest occasion dispensing good
how seldom used how little understood
to nurse with tender care the thriving arts
watch every beam philosophy imparts
to give religion her unbridled scope
nor judge by statute a believer's hope
with close fidelity and love unfeign'd
to keep the matrimonial bond unstain'd
covetous only a virtuous praise
his life a lesson to the land he sways
blest country where these kingly glories shine
blest england if this happiness be thine
but
if smiling peeresses and simp'ring peers
encompassing his throne a few short years
if the gilt carriage and the pamper'd steed
that wants no driving and disdains the lead
if guards mechanically form'd in ranks
playing at beat drum their martial pranks
shouldering and standing as if stuck to stone
while condescending majesty looks on
if monarchy consists in such base things
sighing i say again i pity kings
 an immense number splendid carriages now presented
themselves to view in continued and uninterrupted succession
stretching from the horse guards the whole length the mall to
buckinghamhouse where each setting down and thence taking up a
position in the birdcage walk they formed a circle nearly two
miles and exhibited in the magnificence the vehicles the admirable
symmetry the horses and rich liveries the attendants a scene 
interest matchless perhaps by any other metropolis in the universe
skirting the indeterminable line carriages that slowly and under
frequent stoppages proceeded to the goal attraction our party
penetrated at last the dense mass spectators and gaining
a favourable post observation took a position adjacent to
buckinghamhouse where the band music the foot guards within
and that the horse guards without the ironrailing circumscribing the
palace alternately enlivened the scene with concord sweet sounds
but the great and general object attention was that female
loveliness occupying almost every passing vehicle dashall remarked
that he had never before been gratified with such an extensive and
captivating display sir felix and the squire were in raptures and even
the primitive austerity miss macgilligan yielded to the influence 
beauty and acknowledging its predominancy she at same time observed
that its fascination was enhanced by the dress the ladies which
though splendid exhibited genuine taste and was more remarkable for
its uniform adherence to modesty than she had hitherto seen it on any
similar occasionally
 we are not fastidious neither would we wish the charms 
youth and beauty inaccessible to admiration but certainly
the dress or rather undress our fair countrywomen has
 late years bordered closely on nudity female delicacy
is powerfully attractive we were glad to observe its
predominancy at the last levee and we trust that it will
gain universal prevalence edit
 dashall whose place would more properly have been in the
circle within the palace than amongst the spectators without was
frequently saluted by the passing company and when the fair hand
 beauty waved gracefully towards him sir felix felt happy in
the friendship and society a gentleman thus honoured with such
distinguished recognition and in the warmth his feelings exclaimed
aloud that by the immortal powers were he king england he would
be more proud the irradiating charms these celestial visitors
than in the diadem royalty and extension empire this remark was
universally acquiesced in and most cordially so by a group lively
girls to whom it had apparently given much pleasure one whom
thanked the baronet in the name the sex and complimented him on his
gallantry which she said was truly characteristic his country
to sir felix an encomium from a fair lady was ever irresistible
he bowed expressed a commensurate feeling gratitude for the honour
conferred upon him and professed himself an ardent admirer the whole
 women kind concluding by humming a stanza from burns
auld nature swears the lovely dears
her noblest work she classes o
her prentice han she tried on man
and then she made the lasses o
unluckily for the apophthegm the baronet it so happened that a
quarrel took place in the immediate vicinity and hearing the party
between two rival female fruiterers the emerald isle during which
incivilities were exchanged in language not altogether acceptable to the
auricular organs delicacy the brogue was that munster the
war words waged quicker and faster and from invective the heroines
seemed rapidly approximating to actual battle neither parkkeeper nor
constable were at hand and although the surrounding mobility laughed
at the tumult and enjoyed the storm sir felix much distressed at
so untoward an incident and deeply interested in the honour his
country so lately the theme elegant panegyric dashed through the
crowd the component parts which he scattered aside like chaff and
arrested the further progress the wranglers
arrah now for the honour munster be any ye brats the devil's
own begetting
hear him hear him hear the umpire resounded from all quarters
may the devil make hellbroth ye both in his own caldron
 the mirth the multitude became now still more absent
intermixes sans inquiry with honourable rank and even
where inquiry is deemed necessary all minor considerations
vanish before the talismanic influence wealth is he
rich incalculably so then let's have him by all means
thus the initiated chesterfield obtain admission into
polished society although the principles politeness
inculcated by that nobleman contain as a celebrated
lexicographer said them the morals a whe and the
manners a dancingmaster
the party having lounged away another pleasant hour made ultimately
their exit from the park by the stableyard and entering pall mall
were agreeably surprised with a very interesting exhibition
during many years the late king's reign it was usual on the
birthday anniversary for the different mail coaches to pass in review
before his majesty in front st james's palace the custom still
prevails
on the present occasion numerous spectators had assembled opposite carl
tonhouse and it is presumed that the sovereign thence witnessed the
procession although he was not within the view public observation
 above thirty mail coaches fresh gilt and painted or in
the language churchwardens beautified and each drawn by four
noblespirited yet perfectly tractable horses elegantly caparisoned
now made their appearance the cavalcade moved slowly onward the
prancing steeds impatient restraint and conscious superiority
on the box each vehicle was seated a portly good looking man
the knowing jehu the road and behind was the guard occasionally
winding his buglehorn with melodious and scientific ability the
reins and harness were new so also were the royal liveries the
coachmen and guards mounted conductors led the van the procession
while others accompanied it on either side and the interest the
scene was considerably heightened by each coach being occupied inside
by handsome welldressed women and children the rear this imposing
spectacle was brought up by a long train the twopenny postboys all
newly clothed in the royal uniform and mounted on hardy ponies chiefly
 the highland and shetland breed the cavalcade halted in front the
royal residence and gave three cheers in honour the day which
were heartily returned by the populace the procession then resumed its
progress by charingcross the strand fleetstreet ludgatehill round
st paul's and by cheapside into lombardstreet
passing up the new street the associates reached the mansion 
dashall who had previously engaged his friends to dinner
an elegant repast was immediately served up and highly enjoyed by the
party after such prolonged exercise and abstinence
the conversation turning on the recent interesting exhibition it was
universally acknowledged that the introduction the mail coach into
the establishment the general postoffice might be classed among the
highest improvements the age as amazingly accelerating the
celerity intercourse with all parts the empire neither was
the wellmerited meed encomium withheld from the twopennypost
institution by which so frequently in the course the day the
facility communication is kept up within the metropolis and suburbs
extending to all decencies and bounded only by the limits the
bills mortality dashall who seldom let slip an opportunity 
appropriate remark digressed from the procession to the
important national utility the postoffice and thence by easy
transition to the sublime powers the human mind as emphatically
exemplified in the invention writing and printing while sir felix
who was well experienced in the british poets favoured his aunt with a
quotation from pope's epistle heroism to abelard subject however
to such whimsical interpolation as he deemed suitable to the occasion
heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid some antique
lovesick north ireland maid they live they speak they breathe
what age inspires preposterous fondness and impure desires the latent
wish without a blush impart reveal the frailties a morbid heart
speed the neglected sigh from soul to soul and waft a groan from indus
to the pole
the reading miss macgilligan like her ideas was rather on a
contracted scale she suspected however that her nephew had aimed
against her the shafts ridicule and was preparing her resentment
accordingly when the baronet deprecating her wrath assured her that
he had recited the lines exactly as originally written and that in the
present clay they had no personal application having been composed by
a little cynical fellow many years before miss macgilligan came into
existence the lady gave credence to the assertion and the impending
storm was happily averted
the residence royalty being within the precinct st james's the
bells the neighbouring church sounded a merry peal in the ears 
the party and were responded to by those st martininthefields
a parish which it is remarkable that his majesty george was once
churchwarden serving the office course by deputy the steeple
 this church as well as those many others in the metropolis
displayed throughout the day the royal standard a manifestation 
loyalty which likewise extended itself to the liquid element old
father thames where many the vessels commemorated the anniversary by
frequent salutes artillery under the decorative and splendid canopy
formed by the colours all nations
 the carriages the foreign ambassadors and those the
friends government were again in requisition and rattled along the
streets towards the several mansions the members administration
who each in conformity with ancient usage gave a grand dinner on the
birthday at least on that appointed for its celebration
at these dinners said dashall politics and etiquette are both laid
aside conviviality is the order the day the glass the joke
the repartee and the retort courteous circulate freely and all is
harmony and good humour
with sometimes a sprinkling alloy said the squire i have heard
that during the administration mr pitt he and the lord chancellor
throw were frequently at variance on subjects having no reference to
politics and even under the exhilarating influence the grape
the party were all attention and the squire proceeded at a cabinet
dinner a discussion took place between the premier and lord chancellor
as to the comparative merits the latin and english languages mr
pitt gave the preference to the former the chancellor to the
latter and the arguments on both sides were carried on with equal
pertinacity the premier would not yield a jot in opinion becoming at
last impatient opposition
why said he the english language is an ambiguity two
negatives make an affirmative but in the latin two negatives make a
positive then said the chancellor your father and mother must
have been two negatives to make such a positive fellow as you are
 lord chancellor throw although a very eccentric
character was yet a man uncommon benevolence a vacancy
having occurred in a valuable living which he had the
presentation numerous were the candidates for the benefice
and amongst others one recommended by several the
nobility friends the ministry who made himself sure 
the appointment although directly or indirectly the
chancellor had not given any promise in the meanwhile it
was one morning announced to his lordship that a gentleman
apparently a clergyman waited the honour an interview
the servant was ordered to shew the stranger into the
library whither the chancellor shortly repaired and
inquired the object the visit my lord said the
other i served the office curate under the deceased
rector and understanding that the presentation is in your
lordship's gift you want the living exclaimed the
chancellor gruffly no my lord my humble pretensions
soar not so high but i presume most respectfully to
entreat your lordship's influence with the new incumbent
that i may be continued in the curacy surprised and
pleased by the singular modesty the applicant who had
served the same parish as curate above twenty years and now
produced the most ample testimonials character his
lordship entered into conversation with him and found him
 extensive erudition and orthodox principles he
ascertained besides that this poor curate had a wife with
six children entirely dependent on his exertions for
support and that the remuneration allowed for the faithful
discharge arduous duties had been only thirty pounds per
annum the chancellor now promised his influence in behalf
 the curate with the person who probably might succeed to
the living i shall see him added his lordship this
very day attend me tomorrow and you shall know the
result the curate took his leave and in the course the
morning the wouldbe rector made his appearance o
exclaimed his lordship entering directly into the business
i have had a humble suitor with me today the curate 
the late incumbent whom you are desirous succeeding he
wishes to continue in the curacy the poor man is burthened
with a large family and hitherto has been very inadequately
rewarded for his labour in the productive vineyard which
you anticipate the possession and emolument suppose that
you constitute the happiness this worthy man by giving
him a salary one hundred pounds per annum he will have
all the duties to perform and you will pocket a surplus
even then seven hundred a year for in fact doing
nothing this wouldbe was astonished he had never before
heard a curate in the receipt one hundred pounds per
annum besides he had already engaged a person to do the
duty for twentyfive pounds fired with indignation at the
inhumanity and arrogant presumption this calloushearted
clergyman what exclaimed his lordship and so you
would turn the poor curate out doors and abridge the
miserable pittance his successor and all this before
you've got the living john shew this fellmo down stairs
gladly would this incumbent by anticipation have conceded
every point required but it was too late the die was cast
and he found himself in the street unknowing how he got
there whether on his hands or his lucas next day the
curate was announced i have not been able to succeed
said his lordship the new incumbent has engaged a person
who will do the duty for twentyfive pounds per annum his
lordship paused and the unfortunate curate looked the
personification despondency cheer up man exclaimed
his lordship if i have not influence sufficient to
continue you in possession the curacy i can at least
give you the living putting into the hands at the same
time the amazed curate the presentation to a rectory
worth eight hundred pounds per annum here we must draw the
grecian painter's veil the gratification on either side
may be conceived but cannot be expressed
 sir felix laughed heartily at this anecdote and inquired 
his aunt whether she knew any the positive family in the north 
ireland
perfectly well retorted the lady they are allied to the
roundheads the province munster
this reproof which was hailed with applause by tom and bob
dumbfoundered the baronet who became suddenly taciturn but his
habitual good humour predominated and conscious that he had brought
on himself the inflicted castigation he resolved on a cessation 
hostilities for the remainder the evening
the invitation by dashall having been without formal ceremony and
unhesitatingly accepted by miss macgilligan and her nephew they now in
turn claimed the like privilege freedom by soliciting the company
 the two cousins to supper a request which tom and bob cheerfully
acquiesced in and the party immediately set out for the baronet's
lodgings preferring to walk the short distance that they might view
more leisurely the accustomed illuminations on the anniversary his
majesty's birthday
the variegated lamps were tastefully arranged but this effusion 
loyalty was rather an interested than interesting description being
confined wholly to the publicoffices the theatres and the different
houses his majesty's tradesmen no other habitation in this immense
metropolis bearing any external indication attachment on the part 
its occupant to the sovereign the british empire
here comes a set jolly fellows exclaimed the baronet as the party
 friends turned into bowstreet from coventgarden who are at least
determined to honour the anniversary st george and their sovereign
the clang marrow bones and cleavers resounding with harsh and
stunning dissonance
rather said dashall fellows determined to levy contributions on the
public caring as little for the actual george the king as they do for
the fabulous george the champion
now loud and yet louder the grating din grew
and near and more near still the butchergang drew
rapacious obstreperous a turbulent set
and bent on annoyance all whom they met
 it was in vain that our party attempted to avoid them by
crossing the street the intention was quickly thwarted by these
selflicensed prowlers who intercepting our associates in the
carriageway encircled them in such a manner as to preclude the
possibility extrication and raised at the same time a discoid
 sounds compared with which the vocal minstrelsy the longeared
braying fraternity would have been the music the spheres
sir felix in chastisement their arrogance would singly have
encountered the whole group had he not been restrained by tom and bob
who rather than engage in a street brawl with a host pertinacious
adversaries chose to yield to circumstances and purchase freedom
at the expense a trifling pecuniary consideration with which the
collectors departed well satisfied
our observers having thus obtained their liberty renewed their walk
and reached the lodgings the baronet without farther interruption
during their perambulation the following article was put into the hands
 the squire with which we shall conclude our chapter incidents
the king and the laureat
a loyal birthday effusion
hail mighty monarch a mighty people
while tuneful peals resound from tower and steeple
and thundering cannons gratulations roar
frightening old father thames from shore to shore
for king or etiquette while nobles caring
to buckinghamhouse by hundreds are repairing
with gorgeous dames to whom this day a bliss is
accompanied by smiling lovely misses
 eager appetite who long to gorge
and batten on the favours king george
while london's mayor and aldermen set out
in civic state to grace the royal rout
while strut the guards in black straps and white gaiters
in honour their patron and creators
while general birnie musters all his forces
 foot police and spavin police horses
to guard st james's park from innovation
and cheque the daringness depredation
while for those partizans who mi
 character is an abundant and everlasting supply humour and
eccentricity for an observant quiz like yourself and being fly to most
occurrences either in town or country i shall rather confine myself to
the most remarkable circumstances that happen to strike my recollection
us we proceed the first that occurs at this moment is the opening a
new establishment in regentstreet under the title the cafe royale
to which as we have not yet paid a visit i propose now to direct your
steps
cafe royale repeated sparkle there is something frenchified in the
sound i suppose it is quite in the tip top stile elegance
so says report
then allons but as we proceed i beg to ask one question if it
be considered important in a national point view that the superior
elegancies our parisian neighbours should be engrafted on our own
habits and that an establishment this nature should be formed with
a view its becoming the resort rank and fashion whether any good
reason can be given why such an establishment in an english city for
englishmen should not have an english title
a most extraordinary question for a fashionable man
it may be so continued sparkle but you must attribute it to my
country habits thinking however as i like argument better than
assertion i see no reason to abandon my question the adoption 
any thing foreign is only rational in proportion as it is useful or
agreeable for foreign wines foreign fruits foreign made coffee c
no one can be a greater advocate than myself but i apprehend that these
good things may taste as well whether the room in which they are taken
be called by a french or an english name
that is a truth so self evident as to require no reply and really i
can give no sort reason for the adoption a french title unless
it be with a view to give it that air novelty which invariably proves
attractive to johnny bull and i think i need not attempt to explain to
you the importance a title
however said sparkle i cannot help thinking that if the place
alluded to is to become a permanent establishment it would become an
englishman to have an english name for it we need not be ashamed our
language although some folks disdain to use it if they can find
any substitute however inapt why should it not be called the royal
coffeehouse the king's coffeehouse the patrician the universal orin
fact any thing so that it be english
 because said tallyhoho those titles are already engrossed
by newspaper editors coffeeshops a lower order magazines c
for instance we have the royal magazine the universal magazine
and consequently these are all grown common and any thing common is
extremely vulgar
besides continued dashall cafe royale is a mouthful without
attacking its contents and the very sound it seems to impart a
taste before you approach it what may be obtained in the interior
zounds this country life your's seems to have altered your opinions
and almost obliterated your former education i never had any relish for
it
in town let me live and in town let me die for in truth can't
relish the country not i if one must have a villa in summer to dwell
oh give me the sweet shady side pall mall
by this time they had reached the cafe royale and upon entrance were
ushered by a man in blue livery with gold laced trimmings into an
apartment far exceeding in splendour any thing that their previous
conversation had led them to expect the walls formed looking glass
and rich tapestry and ornamented in a fanciful manner reflected their
persons as they passed along at every point while the choicest flowers
and shrubs with which they were surrounded sent forth a delightful
fragrance and gave some distant idea eastern luxuries
here said the hon tom dashall is elegance at least and if
the accommodations are found to be equally good it can be little
consequence to us whether the place itself have an english or a foreign
name
i confess replied sparkle that i still conceive that as a place
 resort appropriated to the upper ranks natives and foreigners
magnificent in its decorations superior in its accommodations and
conducted with skill and liberality to become truly national and
deserving support it should be honoured with an english title
and that it certainly is continued dashall not only one but many
for nobility is frequently to be found within its walls nay a proof 
it appears at this moment for there is lord p and lord c now
entering but come let us try the coffee catch a view the papers
and proceed
 they had now seated themselves near an elderly gentleman who
seemed to be in deep contemplation occasionally rubbing his hands with
apparent gratification and shaking his head with importance while he
glanced over a newspaper which lay before him
i should judge said tallyhoho he is a member parliament
probably conning over the report his last night's speech in the
house
or probably said dashall an author in search ideas for his
next publication wherein he intends to cut up the ministers and their
measures
yes continued sparkle or a quack doctor examining if the editor
has given insertion to his new flaming advertisement wherein he
promises to perform what is utterly impossible to be accomplished
i wonder if he can speak said tom laying clown the paper i'll try
him a fine morning sir
as this was directed immediately to meet the old gentleman's ear he
looked up for the first time since they had entered
beautiful sir was the reply and here the conversation ceased again
excellent coffee said sparkle is there any news today sir
endeavouring to rouse him again
there is always news sir was the reply taking a plentiful supply 
snuff
 one sort or other continued bon
why yes have we not every day a quantity newspapers that make their
appearance with the sun
truly replied sparkle but you could hardly misunderstand me i
alluded to something out the common run events such for
instance as relates to the interests the nation the agricultural
distress the distress the irish the state the american
independents the proceedings the spanish cortes and the french
chamber the movements the greeks the operations turkey and
russia or the or 
why sir your inquiries are very rational and as i perceive you have
a desire for intelligence and i have at all times a desire to impart
such as i am in possession for the benefit others the newspapers
have abundance information but i must say the editors though men 
education and intelligence are not always well informed besides sir
there is no reliance on their assertions many valuable and important
secrets are in the hands individuals which never find their way into
the public journals
 having proceeded thus far our three friends were all
anxiety to continue what now assumed the appearance an interesting
conversation
the nation is gull'd by misrepresentation from the high to the low one
system is acted upon but i have a document in my pocket which came into
my possession in rather an extraordinary manner and is as extraordinary
in its contents it was thrust into my hand on my way here by a
stranger who instantly disappeared
a curious salute observed tom probably some state paper some
information on foreign affairs or a petition to be presented to the
house
the fact is sir as i had no conversation with the stranger i was
ignorant the importance the document but upon opening it judge
 my astonishment when i found it concerned a prince well known to the
british nation whose interests depend on its support
o ho said sparkle then perhaps it is a delicate nature and more
attaching to private circumstances than public affairs
you shall hear sir it was an appeal to myself amongst others in
which russia was stated to be in such connection with greece that
the heads this kingdom could not but be conscious the important
results results sir that were enough to make one's hair stand on 
indeed i have never been able to dismiss the subject from my mind since
i first cast my eye over the information
zounds then cried dashall there is much to be apprehended
it is impossible for me continued the old gentleman to say how
far the distinguished person to whom i have alluded has already or
may hereafter succeed in the objects he has in view but this i think
certain that if he can but interest the poles on his side his affairs
must thrive
the hon tom dashall by this time was puzzled with the lengthened
introduction this gentleman was giving he sipped his coffee looked
grave smiled took up the paper pretended to read then laid it down
again
 sparkle looked wise and betrayed his anxiety by moving closer
to the communicant tallyhoho fixed his eyes on the old gentleman with an
apparent desire to count the words he uttered
in the meantime continued the interesting stranger he is so
indefatigable in diffusing through all ranks society by means the
press and private agents a knowledge the power he has smoothing
the way to success that the crown ought to receive his proffered aid
for its own benefit
then said sparkle it really is a document public importance if
not too great a favour might we be allowed a sight the 
the document oh certainly sir said he hastily rising and drawing
a printed paper from his pocket i will leave it with you then
throwing it on the table he made a precipitate retreat
the little care which the old gentleman seemed to take this scrap 
importance struck them all with wonder
a rum old codger said tom and i recommend his observations as well
as the produce his pocket to the serious consideration our friend
sparkle who will perhaps read this paper for the benefit us all
sparkle who by this time had unfolded this mysterious paper burst into
a hearty laugh and as soon as he could command his risibility he read
as follows
prince's russia oil for promoting the growth hair
and sparkle introduced to greece said tom well the old buck has
paid you off for your interruption however he has certainly proved his
own assertion that there is no reliance on any body
a mountain in labour continued tom i think he had you in a line
however
i cannot help thinking replied sparkle that there is a great
similarity between him and some our most popular parliamentary
orators for he has said a great deal to little purpose but come let
us move on and lose no more time in the french coffee house discussing
the merits or virtues russia oil
 this proposition being acceded to our friends now took their
way along pall mall where the improvements recently made struck sparkle
with pleasure and delight the appearance new and elegant houses
occupying the situation buildings a shabby and mean exterior
and the introduction new streets were subjects considerable
admiration
the rapidity alterations in london said sparkle are almost
inconceivable
that remark replied tom only arises from your late absence from the
scene action for to us who frequently see their progress there is
but little to excite wonder now for my part i am more astonished
in present times when so many complaints are made distress that
occupiers can be found for them and also seeing the increase 
buildings at every part the environs london where tenants can be
found to occupy them
i confess said tallyhoho that is a subject which i have often thought
upon without being able to come to any reasonable conclusion it appears
to me to prove a great increase population for although i am aware
 the continued influx new comers from the country the towns and
villages appear as full as ever
i am not able to solve the mystery to my own satisfaction replied
sparkle in either case though i cannot help acknowledging the facts
alluded to it however seems in this place to prove the correctness 
the poet's lines who says
wherever round this restless world we range
nothing seems constant saving constant change
like some magician waving mystic wand
improvement metamorphoses the land
grubs up pulls down then plants and builds anew
till scenes once loved are banished from our view
the draughtsman with officious eye surveys
what capabilities a site displays
how things may be made better for the worse
and much improve at least the schemer's purse
continuing their course along parliamentstreet they soon arrived at
westminsterbridge when the day proving extremely fine it was proposed
to embrace the opportunity making an excursion by water the tide
served for london bridge and without further ceremony tom bob and
sparkle jumped into a wherry and were quickly gliding along upon the
bosom old father thames the smiling appearance the day and the
smooth unruffled surface the water excited the most cheerful and
enlivening feelings the mind
 nice weather for the rowing match said a bluff looking
sturdy built waterman who had doffed his coat waistcoat and cravat
in order to facilitate him in performing his duty
rowing match inquired tom when does it take place
why this afternoon at four o'clock your honour vauxhall will be very
full tonight them ere people what's got it now are a getting plenty
 company and they will have a bumper tonight for the gentlemen what
belongs to the funny club gives a funny to be rowed for
that's funny enough exclaimed sparkle
and convenient too said tom for as we have no engagement for the
evening we can mingle with the lads on their water frolic
with all my heart said bob and as i am given to understand vauxhall
is greatly improved it will make an admirable wind up the day
approaching waterloo bridge what have we here exclaimed tallyhoho
that said tom is a floating fire engine for the protection 
shipping and sometimes very useful in cases fire on the banks the
river
an excellent idea continued bob because they can never be in want
 water
will you sit a little more this way sir if you please we shall trim
better
bob rose hastily upon this intimation and had not his cousin caught him
by the coat would have trimmed himself into the watery element
zounds man you had nearly upset us all you must trim the boat and
sit steady or we shall all go to davy's locker you must not attempt
to dance in such a vehicle as this
bob's confusion at this circumstance created laughter to his two
friends which however he could not exactly enjoy with the same relish
nor did he perfectly recover himself till they were safely landed at
tower stairs
now said tom i propose a peep at the interior this place a row
down to greenwich to dinner and then a touch at the rowing match what
say you agreed on all hands
 then said the hon tom dashall wait for us here old boy
and you shall be our conveyancer
i don't know nothing you gentlemen and you understand me i'm
not a going to be done i'm too old a hand to be catch'd in that there
fashion but if so be you engages me for the day you can take the
number my boat but then you must tip
right said sparkle who knows whether we shall escape the lions and
then how is old rough and tough to get paid
you'll excuse me gentlemen i don't mean no affront upon my soul but
i have stood the nonsense before now and been flung but i won't
be served out in that there way any more i am up to the gossip and
expects you'll come down with the rag
certainly said tom dashall with a smile i am aware the hint
which by the way is pretty broadly conveyed therefore be satisfied
and giving him a sovereign they proceeded into the tower
the entrance to the tower from the wharf is by a drawbridge near to
which is a cut connecting the river with the ditch having a water gate
called traitor's gate state prisoners having been formerly conveyed by
this passage from the tower to westminster for trial and over this gate
is the waterworks which supply the fortress
having passed the drawbridge bob looked around him almost conceiving
himself in a new world he saw houses and streets which he had
formed no conception
zounds said he this tower seems almost to contain a city
yes replied dashall it occupies some ground its extent within the
walls is twelve acres and five roods the exterior circuit the ditch
which entirely surrounds it is feet the principal buildings are
the church the white tower the ordnance office the record office
the jewel office the horse armoury the grand store house the
small armoury the houses belonging to the officers barracks for the
garrison and two settling houses for the accommodation the military
and the inhabitants
 the white tower as it is called is a large square building in
the centre the fortress on the top which are four watch towers
one being at present used as an observatory neither the sides this
building nor the small towers are uniform the walls are whitewashed
near to it is the grand storehouse a plain building brick and stone
 feet long and feet broad
being conducted to the spanish armory tallyhoho was much gratified
with a view its contents trophies the famous victory queen
elizabeth over the spanish armada among which the most remarkable were
the thumb screws intended to be used in order to extort confession
from the english where their money was hidden the axe with which
the unfortunate anne sullen was beheaded by order henry viii
a representation queen elizabeth in armour standing by a
creamcoloured horse attended by a page also attracted his attention
her majesty being dressed in the armour she wore at the time she
addressed her brave army at tilbury in with a white silk
petticoat richly ornamented with pearls and spangles in the small
armory which is one the finest rooms in europe containing complete
stands arms for men they could not but admire the beautiful
and elegant manner in which the arms were disposed forming tasteful
devices in a variety figures a piece ordnance from egypt and the
highland broadsword also claimed particular notice
 the spanish armory small armory train artillery and
horse armory may be seen at the price s each person
with a compliment per company to the warder
the volunteer armory containing arms piled in beautiful order for
 men with pikes swords c in immense numbers presented
to them a fine figure charles brandon duke suffolk in bright
armour bearing the very lance he actually used in his lifetime which
is no less than feet long the sea armory containing arms for nearly
 seamen and marines and the royal artillery which is partly kept
on the ground floor under the small armory next underwent inspection
here they could not help admiring the room which is feet long
 feet wide and feet high and the many peculiarly fine pieces 
cannon which it contained the artillery is ranged on each side leaving
a passage in the centre ten feet in breadth twenty pillars in
this room support the small armory above which are hung round with
implements war and trophies taken from the enemy producing
altogether a grand and imposing effect
 the horse armory a noble room crowded with
curiosities proved a source high gratification here they found
themselves in company with all the kings england from william the
conqueror to george iii the whole on horseback and in armour the
armour john gaunt duke lancaster seven feet high and the
sword and lance proportionable size were viewed as objects 
wonder
in the jewel office containing the regalia state was the next
object to which they directed their attention here they were shewn the
imperial crown with which the kings england are crowned it is
made gold enriched with diamonds emeralds rubies sapphires
and pearls the cap is purple velvet lined with white safety and
turned up with three rows ermine this crown is never used but at
coronations the golden globe which is placed in the king's right hand
before he is crowned the golden sceptre and its cross upon a
large amethyst decorated with table diamonds the sceptre which is
considered to be far the most ancient in the collection and probably a
part the original regalia is covered with jewels and gothic enamel
work surmounted with an onyx dove was found by the present keeper
in the year and is estimated at a very high value st edward's
staff made beaten gold and which is borne before the king in the
coronation procession is feet inches and a half in length and 
inches and quarters round the golden salt seller the sword mercy
without a point the grand silver font used for christening the
royal family and the crown state worn by the king at his meeting
 the parliament and other state occasions were viewed in succession
with admiration and delight the latter is great splendour and value
it is covered with precious stones a large size and on the top 
its cross is a pearl which charles i pledged for eighteen thousand
pounds to the dutch republic under the cross is an emerald diamond
 a palish green colour valued at one hundred thousand pounds being
seven inches and
 the jewel office is shewn for s each person in company
a single person pays s d it may be seen separately but
not without a warder
a half in circumference in the front is a rock ruby in its purely
natural state unpolished three inches in length the value which
cannot be estimated several other curiosities state regalia such as
the golden eagle the golden spur the crown queen mary the cross
 king william and the diadem worn by the queens anne and mary were
numbered among the valuable jewels contained in this office together
with abundance curious old plate the value which independent
 several the jewels which are inestimable is not less than two
millions sterling
 now said dashall as they left the jewel office we have
taken a view the inanimate we must not leave the spot without
a peep at the lionsl for though i believe there is nothing very
extraordinary in the collection more than may be seen at the menagerie
at exeter change it would be an unpardonable omission not to see the
lions in the tower
 the wild beasts c are shewn at s each
for this purpose they proceeded to the western entrance where they were
quickly introduced by the keeper to the various animals under his care
and who in going round with them explained as usual their several
histories
in examining these various curiosities time had imperceptibly stolen a
march upon them and their original plan proceeding to greenwich was
found to be impracticable besides which upon reaching the stairs where
they had landed the bluff old waterman was not to be found
zounds said dashall this looks like a do i wonder what's become 
the old blade
sparkle began to laugh and bob bit his lip tom made inquiry a boy
at the stairs who informed him that barney was gone to the settling
house to smoak a pipe
all right said tom then we will soon rouse him and start
upon this they moved back again into the tower and according to the
directions they had received they found barney in the taproom
puffing away care and singing with stentorian voice to the surrounding
company
from elongate to limehouse hole
you will not meet a kinder soul
while the thames is flowing
pull away ho pull away ho
 in search real life and character and at all times rather
inclined to promote mirth than spoil sport our friends immediately
entered unperceived by barney and taking an opposite corner the
room were quickly attended by the landlord who received orders and
produced them supplies
the song being over and barney rewarded for his exertions by the most
enthusiastic applause the room he renewed his pipe at the same
time declaring to a soldier who sat near him he thought he had miss'd
fire for he was d d if he didn't think he'd lost his company
or his company had lost him but that he had taken care to nibble the
blunt and upon that there score all was right so landlord tip us
another quart and if they don't make their appearance by the time
i've got through that i'll tip them the toddle shove off my boat and
disappear that's the time day an't it boy
why aye to be sure replied the soldier you watermen leads a happy
life you are your own masters you does just as you pleases while a
soldier dare as well be d d as desert his post but i say barney
mind what
you says nose nose accompanying the last two words with a
significant action placing his finger on his nose and winking his
eye
upon this intimation which appeared to be well understood by barney
he puffed off an immoderate cloud smoke and looking round the room
perceived his customers in the corner
be quiet said he that's my fare so it's all right again do you
want me gentlemen i am always ready so that whenever you says the
word barney's your boy
presently said dashall for it would be hard to make you start upon
a full jorum
why i must say continued barney i never likes to leave a foaming
quart behind me and catching hold the pot heavy wet he roared
out
what a hearty blade am i
care can never touch my heart
every trouble i defy
while i view the foaming quart
and taking a hearty drink he handed it to his companion filled
his pipe afresh lighted and informed the gentlemen he was at their
service when in a few minutes all being ready they were quickly onboard

 i don't like the looks the weather my masters why we
shall have a shower presently where will you go to
to vauxhall was the reply
very well your honour then here goes but if you don't get a sousing
my name an't barney
this prognostication proved true for before they reached blacksmiths
bridge a smart shower came on which nearly wetted them through before
they could reach land when this was accomplished they proceeded to the
horn tavern doctors commons where they partook an excellent repast
and the weather clearing up they again joined barney
by this time the promising fineness the evening had induced many
to venture forth to the rowing match and the river was all gaiety and
delight boats every description were seen filled with well dressed
persons both male and female the smiling countenances the lads and
lasses were in unison with the laughing sun that darted his brilliant
beams upon the dimpled wave which seemed to leap in return with
grateful animation the shores were lined with spectators anxiously
waiting the moment for the commencement this trial skill our
friends were highly delighted with the prospect before them and at the
appointed time having rested on their oars near the place starting
they saw with pleasure the active preparations on the part the
competitors and upon the signal being given for the start the river
appeared to consist nothing but moving conveyances happy faces
all guided in one direction the shouts the various friends the
occasionally successful candidates for the honour victory and the
skill and dexterity with which they manoeuvred against each other were
subjects continued admiration while bands music were heard from
boats that intermingled with the throng the lads the funny club were
in high glee numerous cutters and sailing boats with their owners and
visiting friends were also in the throng barney pulled away like
a good one and for a considerable distance kept nearly up with the
principal actors in this gay and animated scene aquatic diversion
and arrived off cumberland gardens just in time to have an excellent
view the winner coming in at the appointed spot in prime style
amidst the loud and reiterated plaudits his friends
 the intention visiting vauxhall gardens was however for
the present evening relinquished and our party feeling fatigued by
their excursion repaired homeward where for the present we shall leave
them to their quiet and repose
chapter xxii
i hate that drum's discordant sound
still rolling round and round and round
 exclaimed dashall as he advanced from the breakfast table
towards the window when a pleasing and singular streetexhibition
presented itself which had attracted around a numerous audience all
ages and conditions
an itinerant purveyor novelties was in the act showing forth to an
admiring crowd the docility a tame hare on a table in the street
on which was placed a drum the little animal stood in an erect
posture and with surprising tractableness obeyed the commands its
exhibiter delivered in very broken english with which nevertheless
it seemed perfectly conversant
vat matter now dat you be so solly and no take notice your good
friends come are shew your politesse and salute de gentlemen
at de window who so kind as come to look at you make way dere good
peoples and leetel chiltern dat de gentlemen sail see dat will do
now are begin do your obeisance all round
the animal without any apparent instruction to whom to give the
precedency obeisance immediately faced de gentlemen at de
window and saluted them with a cone particular respect which
being acknowledged with a motion the hand by dashall the intelligent
animal expressed its sense his complacency by a second obeisance
more profound than the first
the spectators applauded and the performer testified its gratitude by a
bow all round
dat all good now are tree role on de from for le roi
d'angletterre vive le roi d'anglettere 
this command the animal very promptly obeyed by substituting its forefeet
for sticks and giving three prolonged rolls the drum each indistinct
succession
now den for messieurs
 with equal alacrity this hint was attended to and as le roi
d'angletterre had three so de gentlemen at de window were honoured
with two rolls the drum
the like compliment was paid to all de english peoples and the minor
salute one roll was given to the surrounding spectators
the indefatigable drummer was next required to give a token regard
for the cook but this he declined to do and the order though
frequently given was as frequently complied with
will you take notice me den
this question was instantly answered by the accustomed mark respect
gentleman at de window and peoples on de street my leetel drummer
no love de cook no show her de respect dat he show you he know dat de
cook be no friend de pauvre hare then turning towards the animal
vat said he must i speak all de tanks oneself
in deficiency speech the animal reiterated its obeisance
diable exclaimed the exhibiter here comes de cook to kill and spit
you
the hare instantly hastened to its hiding place and thus terminated the
exhibition
this epitome the world observed tallyhoho lacks nothing to gratify
every sense man here industry is on the alert to accumulate wealth
and dissipation in haste to spend it here riot and licentiousness
roll triumphantly in gilded state while merit pines in penury and
obscurity and here ingenuity roams the streets for a scanty and
precarious subsistence exhibiting learned pigs dogs and so
forth that will cast accounts with the precision an experienced
arithmetician and a tame hare that will beat a drum and make a bow
more gracefully than a dancingmaster this last instance human
ingeniousness by which the poor frenchman picks up a living would
almost induce a belief that the power art is inimitable and that
apparently insurmountable difficulties may be overcome by diligent
perseverance who besides this foreigner would have thought 
divesting a hare its natural timidity and rendering it subservient
by a display intelligence to the acquirement his subsistence
 and who said dashall would have thought but a german 
training canarybirds to imitate military evolution make a prisoner
 one their fellows as a deserter try and condemn him to
death apparently execute the sentence by shooting him with a small
gun and finally bear away the motionless and seemingly lifeless body
on a wheelbarrow for interment nay who would think inverting the
order nature by creating and cementing a union friendship between
cats and birds and mice associating them together within the confines
 a cage in the utmost harmony social intercourse and who shall
presume to set bounds to the human art that from a deal board has
constructed the figure a man that will beat at the difficult game 
chess the first players in europe and created a wooden musician
that in a solo from the trumpet will excel the best living performers on
that instrument
 it appears by the following letter from pressure in
hungary that this wonderful automaton was originally
invented and exhibited there
during my stay in this city i have been so happy as to
form an acquaintance with m de kempett an aulic counsellor
and director general the salt mines in hungary it seems
impossible to attain to a more perfect knowledge 
mechanics than this gentleman hath done at least no artist
has yet been able to produce a machine so wonderful in its
kind as what he constructed about a year ago m de
kempett excited by the accounts he received the
extraordinary performances the celebrated m de
vaucanson and some other men genius in prance and
england at first aimed at nothing more than to imitate
those artists but he has done more he has excelled them
he has constructed an automaton which can play at chess
with the most skilful players this machine represents a man
 the natural size dressed like a turk sitting before the
table which holds the chessboard this table which is
about three feet and a half long and about two feet and a
half broad is supported by four feet that roll on castors
in order the more easily to change its situation which the
inventor fails not to do from time to time in order to take
away all suspicion any communication both the table and
the figure are full wheels springs and levers m de
kempett makes no difficulty shewing the inside the
machine especially when he finds any one suspects a boy to
be in it i have examined with attention all the parts both
 the table and figure and i am well assured there is not
the least ground for such an imputation i have played a
game at chess with the automaton myself i have particularly
remarked with great astonishment the precision with which
it made the various and complicated movements the arm
with which it plays it raises the arm it advances it
towards that part the chessboard on which the piece
stands which ought to be moved and then by a movement 
the wrist it brings the hand down upon the piece opens the
hand closes it upon the piece in order to grasp it lifts
it up and places it upon the square it is to be removed to
this done it lays its arm down upon a cushion which
is placed on the chessboard if it ought to
take one its adversary's pieces then by one entire
movement it removes that piece quite off the chessboard
and by a series such movements as have been describing
it returns to take up its own piece and place it in the
square which the other had left vacant i attempted to
practise a small deception by giving the queen the move 
a knight but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed
on he took up my queen and replaced her in the square she
had been removed from all this is done with the same
readiness that a common player shews at this game and i
have often engaged with persons who played neither so
expeditiously nor so skilfully as this automaton who yet
would have been extremely affronted if one had compared
them to him you will perhaps expect me to propose some
conjectures as to the means employed to direct this machine
in its movements i wish i could form any that were
reasonable and wellfounded but notwithstanding the minute
attention with which i have repeatedly observed it i have
not been able in the least degree to form any hypothesis
which could satisfy myself the english ambassador prince
justinian and several english lords for whom the
inventor had the complaisance to make the figure play stood
round the table while i played the game they all had their
eyes on m de kempett who stood by the table or sometimes
removed five or six feet from it yet not one them could
discover the least motion in him that could influence the
automaton they who had seen the effects produced by the
loadstone in the curious exhibitions on the boulevards at
paris cried out that the loadstone must have been the
means here employed to direct the arm but besides that
there are many objections to this supposition m de
kempett with whom i have had long conversations since on
this subject offers to let any one bring as close as he
pleases to the table the strongest and bestarmed magnet
that can be found or any weight iron whatever without
the least fear that the movements his machine will be
affected or disturbed by it he also withdraws to any
distance you please and lets the figure play four or five
moves successively without approaching it it is unnecessary
to remark that the marvellous in this automaton consists
chiefly in this that it has not as in others the most
celebrated machines this sort one determined series 
movements but that it always moves in consequence the
manner in which its opponent moves which produces an
amazing multitude different combinations in its
movements m de kempett winds up from time to time the
springs the arm this automaton in order to renew its
moving force but this you will observe has no relation to
its guiding force or power direction which makes the
great merit this machine in general i am opinion
that the contriver influences the direction almost every
stroke played by the automaton although as i have said i
have sometimes seen him leave it to itself for many moves
together which in my opinion is the mostdifficult
circumstance all to comprehend in what regards this
machine m de kempett has the more merit in this invention
as he complains that his designs have not always been
seconded by workmen so skilful as was requisite to the exact
precision a work this nature and he hopes he shall
ere long produce to the world performances still more
surprising than this indeed one may expect every thing from
his knowledge and skill which are exceedingly enhanced by
his uncommon modesty never did genius triumph with less
ostentation
 london is a rare place for sights always something
new where the spirits need never flag through want amusement let
me recapitulate there is the automaton chessplayer and the automaton
trumpeter the family compact alias amicable society cat birds
and mice the military canaries and an hundred phenomena besides 
which we shall make the round in due time in the meanwhile let us
set out like the knight la mania in search adventures without
running the risk mistaking windmills for giants one the former
would indeed be a high treat to the insatiable curiosity the
inhabitants this metropolis and as to giants there are none on
shew since bartholomewfair excepting those stationary gentlemen the
twinbrothers gog and magog in guildhall
passing through the town without meeting with any new object worthy
 particular notice they found themselves at the extremity 
threadneedlestreet when dashall pointing to a neat plain building
this said he is the south sea house the south sea company was
established for the purpose an exclusive trade to the south seas
and many thousands were ruined by the speculation the iniquity and
deception were at last discovered and those who were at the head
were punished the eager hope wealth frequently engenders
disappointment but here credulity attained her zenith amongst other
schemes equally practicable the projectors this notorious bubble
set up a method making butter from beechtrees a plan to learn
people to cast their nativity an insurance against divorces and a way
 making deal boards out sawdust
and is it possible inquired tallyhoho that such most preposterous
theories obtained belief
even so answered dashall what is there in which human folly
will not believe we have all read the bottleconjurer the
prevalence curiosity is universal i could safely stake any money
that if public notice was given a person who would leap down his own
throat he would gain belief and a full audience would favour him with
their company to witness his marvellous performance
 this speculator by wholesale in english credulity
advertised that he would in the haymarket theatre
literally and bona fide creep into a quart bottle and
further would when inside such quart bottle entertain the
audience with a solo on the violin
long before the appointed hour performance the house was
crammed at all points and thousands were sent from the
doors for want room the most eager curiosity prevailed
as the time drew near for the commencement these
extraordinary feats and the clamour for the appearance 
the performer was incessant and vociferous at last he came
forward upon the stage and all was breathless attention
ladies and gentlemen i am sorry to say that i cannot tonight
find a bottle large enough for the purpose intended
but tomorrow i faithfully engage to go into a pint bottle
in atonement the present disappointment he then
retired the shock was electrical a dead silence prevailed
for a moment the delusion vanished and confusion worse
confounded ensued the interior the house was nearly
demolished his it h the d c was present and lost a
goldhilted sword during the wreck matter and the crush
 worlds the speculator made off with his booty
 proceeding into bishopsgatestreet the new city london
tavern caught the attention tallyhoho
this observed his friend is probably the first tavern in london
with reference to superior accommodation here congregate the most
eminent corporate bodies directors public institutions and others
on occasions business or enjoyment here the admirable arrangement
 every thing conducive to comfort is minutely attended to here the
plenitude abundance and the delicacies luxury distinguish the
festive board and the culinary art is shown forth to the very acme 
perfection which together with the varied unsophisticated excellence
 the richest wines secure to this celebrated tavern the continuance
 a wellmerited public approbation but one these days we shall
avail ourselves practical experience by forming part the company
at dinner
proposing in their way home to take the skirts the metropolis they
directed their course through moorfield where tallyhoho remarked on the
unseemly desolate waste there presenting itself and expressed surprise
that it was not appropriated to some purposes utility or ornament
 it appears answered dashall as if some such improvement
was in projection probably a new square if we may so opine from
present indications however be the intention what it may the
execution is uncommonly tardy with the exception the central
ironrailing the handsome structure on the opposite side the solitary
building on the right and range new houses on the left the tout
ensemble was the same twenty years ago it is a scene dilapidation
which might perhaps have been
more honoured in the breach than in th observance
i recollect that when a boy i frequently extended my rambles into
the quarters cornfields for so was this place then named from its
compartments exhibiting rural appearance even in the centre london
here were four enclosed fields displaying in the season the beautiful
verdure nature and numerous trees branching in ample shade over
two great walks that intersected each other at right angles and formed
the afternoon promenade the citizens wives and daughters in former
times the quarters cornfields were resorted to by holiday visitants
as the favourite place rendezvous where predominated the recreation
 manly exercises and shows gambols and merriment were the orders 
the day the present is an age improvement and yet i cannot think
in an already monstrously overgrown metropolis the substitution 
bricks and mortar an equivalent for green fields and rural simplicity
leaving cornfields they passed in a few minutes into finsburysquare
tallyhoho appeared surprised by its uniformly handsome edifices its
spacious extent and beautiful circular area in which the ground is
laid out and the shrubberies disposed to the very best advantage hereat
least he observed is a proof that taste and elegance are not
altogether excluded a civic residence
in this square taking its name from the division finsbury said
dashall reside many the merchants and other eminent citizens 
london and here in the decorations internally their respective
mansions they vie with the more courtly residents westward and exceed
them generally in the quietude domestic enjoyment
 renewing their walk along the city road the gate dunghill
fields buryingground standing conveniently open let us step in said
dashall this is the most extensive depository the dead in london
and as every grave almost is surmounted by a tombstone we cannot fail
in acquiring an impressive memento mori 
while examining a monumental record which there appeared a countless
number their attention was withdrawn from the dead and attracted by
the living an elderly personage arrayed in a rusty suit sables
with an ink bottle dangling from one the buttons his coat was
intently employed in copying a long yet well written inscription to
the memory patrick colquhoun lld author a treatise on the
police the metropolis and several other works great public
utility having accomplished his object the stranger saluted
dashall and tallyhoho in a manner so courteous as seemingly to invite
conversation
you have chosen sir observed mr dashall rather a sombre cast 
amusement
otherwise occupation said the stranger from which i derive
subsistence amidst the endless varieties real life in london i aman
epitaphcollector favoured by my friends with the appellation 
old mortality furnished them by the voluminous writer and meteor 
the north sir walter scott
do you collect asked tallyhoho with the view publishing on your
own account
no sir i really am not in possession the means wherewith
to embark on so hazardous a speculation i am thus employed by an
eccentric yet very worthy gentleman large property who ambitious
 transmitting his name to posterity means to favour the world with a
more multitudinous collection epitaphs than has hitherto appeared
in any age or nation his prospectus states monumental gleanings in
twentyfive quarto volumes
astonishing exclaimed dashall can it be possible that he ever will
be able to accomplish so vast an undertaking
and if he does said tallyhoho can it be possible that any person will
be found to read a production such magnitude and on such a subject
 that to him is a matter indifference said old
mortality he means to defray the entire charges and the object 
publication effected will rest satisfied with the approbation the
discerning few leaving encomium from the multitude to authors or
compilers more susceptible flattery
born with a stomach to digest a ton
as to the quantum materiel he is indefatigable in personal research
employing besides numerous collectors even in the sister island and in
this from the land'send to johnny grot's house
and when asked dashall is it probable that this gigantic work maybe
completed
can't say answered old mortality i should think at no very remote
period the collection is in daily accumulation and we are already in
possession above one hundred thousand
prodigious exclaimed dashall as dominic sampson says and pray
sir what number may your assiduities have contributed towards the
aggregate
that answered old mortality i cannot exactly ascertain to those
however already supplied this ground will yield a considerable
increase
may we solicit said tallyhoho without the imputation intrusion
the favour your reading to us from your tablebook a few the most
remarkable epitaphs
old mortality readily promised gratification as far as possible but he
had not his tablebook with him i have been employed to day said hein
making extracts from one our manuscript folio volumes for the
purpose insertion in the different metropolitan daily papers here
they are taking a small bundle from his pocket tied round with red
tape one for each paper permit me gentlemen for a moment just to
look over the exhortations
the triumvirate now seated themselves on a tombstone and old mortality
untying the bundle extracts laid them down in loose compact then
taking up the first and reading the superscription shewing for what
newspaper it was intended he reversed it on the tombstone this
said he is for the times british press morning post morning
chronicle morning advertiser morning herald public ledger all

the bundle and read the contents with an audible voice

interchanging civilities the party now separated the collector to
resume his occupation and the two friends their walk
twentyfive quarto volumes exclaimed the squire and exclusively
filled with epitaphs this fellow has set himself a task with a
vengeance
and which answered his friend he will never be able to accomplish
however the ambition renown as a voluminous collector is the less
censurable as being unattended by any its too frequently pernicious
concomitants and giving to others an acceptable and not irrational
employment he is only blameable in the projected extent not the nature
 his pursuit and happy would it be for mankind did the love fame
engender no greater evil than that if any which may accrue from the
herculean labours this epitaph collector
yet to us the uninitiated the country it would never occur that
there existed even in london a man who disseminated his fortune and
applied his mental and corporeal energies in gleaning epitaphs
neither perhaps would it occur that there existed even in london a
virtuoso who discovered that fleas were a species lobster and who
proceeded to proof by the ordeal boiling water on the supposition
that the process would change their hue from black to red and thus
satisfactorily establish the correctness his judgment unfortunately
however the boiled fleas still retained their original colour and the
ingenious hypothesis was reluctantly relinquished
 it is told another virtuoso that he was waited upon
one morning by a stranger who announced that he had the
opportunity procuring an inestimable curiosity a horned
cock but that its owner an avaricious old woman had her
domicile in the highlands scotland to which remote
region it would be necessary to travel amply provided with
the pecuniary means securing this wonderful bird and
that it would be expedient to set out immediately lest the
matchless phenomenon should become the prize a more
fortunate competitor
a horned cock the very acme frolicsome nature a
desideratum in the class lusus naturae which i would
rather possess than the mines peru away my dear
fellow speed like lightning to the north purchase this
precious bird at any price and should the old woman
hesitate at separation from her cornuted companion why then
purchase both and bring them to town with all possible
celerity
in the interval between this important mission and the
achievement its object the anxiety the virtuoso was
inexpressible a horned cock it was the incessant subject
 his cogitations by day and his dreams by night at
last the auspicious moment arrived in the still noontide 
night the preconceived rap at the street door announced the
happy result the momentous expedition the virtuoso
sprang from his couch with extasy to admit the illustrious
prodigy nature his astonishment delight and triumph
were unspeakable two horns the most beautiful curvature
adorned the crested head this noble northern
anticipation thus blessed by the fulness fruition the
bringer was superabundantly rewarded next morning the
virtuoso sent a message to each his most highly favoured
friends desiring attendance at his house instantaneously
on an occasion vast importance gentlemen said he to
his assembled visitants i may now boast possession that
which will astonish the universe a horned cock behold the
rara avis and envy my felicity so saying he uncovered a
wicker basket when lo the bird shorn its honours
indignant at confinement and struggling for freedom had
dropped its waxen antlers the unfortunate virtuoso stood
aghast and speechless and only at last found utterance to
curse his own credulity
 pursuing their course along the city road the two friends were
attracted by the appearance a caravan stationary on the road side
whereon was inscribed in large characters the female salamander
here is another instance observed dashall the varieties real
life in london
walk in gentlemen exclaimed the proprietor and see the surprising
young woman over whom the element fire has no control
tom and bob accepted the invitation entering the caravan they were
received by an interesting young female apparently not more than
eighteen years age with a courteousness manner far beyond what
could have been expected from an itinerant exhibitor
so soon as a sufficient number spectators had congregated within the
vehicle the female salamander commenced her exhibition
taking a redhot poker from the fire she grasped it firmly and drew
it from head to point through her hand without sustaining the smallest
injury
 will you permit me to look at your hand asked dashall
the girl extended her hand the palm was moist and seemed to have
been previously fortified against danger by some secret liquid or
other application now reeking from its recent contact with the flaming
weapon
an uncivilized bumpkin accused her deception asserting that the
poker was not heated to the extent represented
touch and try answered the girl he did so and the cauterizing
instrument gave a feeling although not very satisfactory negative to
his assertion
the mystery continued dashall resisting the impression 
tire certainly originates in the liquid by which your hand has been
protected
i shall answer your observation said the salamander by another
performance
she then dipped her fingers into a pot molten lead and let fall
upon her tongue several drops the metallic fluid to the no small
amazement and terror the company and as if to remove the idea 
precautionary application she after a lapse five minutes repeated
the same extraordinary exhibition and finally immerged her naked feet
in the boiling material
the inscrutable means by which the salamander executed these feats with
the most complete success and safety were not to be divulged and as
neither our respectable friends felt desirous emulating the fair
exorbitant they declined the importunity further inquiry
this is indeed said dashall as they resumed their walk the age
 wonders here is a girl who can bear to gargle her mouth with melted
lead put her delicate feet into the same scalding material and pass
through her hands a flaming redhot poker i am inclined to believe
that were the present an age superstition she might be burnt for a
witch were she not happily incombustible for my own part i sincerely
hope that this pyrophorous prodigy will never think quitting her own
country and as i am a bachelor i verily believe i should be tempted to
make her an offer my hand could i flatter myself with any chance
 raising aflame or making a match with such uninflammable commodity
only conceive the luxury when a man comes home fatigued and in a hurry
for his tea having a wife who can instantly take out the heater
for the urn with her fingers stir the fire with ditto snuff
candles with ditto make a spit her arm or a toasting fork her
thumb what a saving too at the washing season since she need only
hold her hand between the bars till it is redhot thrust it into a
box iron and iron you off a dozen children's frocks while an ordinary
laundress would be coddling the irons over the fire spitting upon them
and holding them to her cheek to ascertain the heat before she began to
work
and observed the squire taking up his friend's vein humour if
the young lady be as insensible to the flames cupid as she is to
those vulcan she might still be highly useful in a national point 
view and well worthy the attention the various fireoffices
exactly so replied his cousin how desirable for instance would it
have been at the late alarming fire in gracechurchstreet to have had
a trustworthy person like her who could very coolly perambulate
the blazing warehouses to rescue from the flames the most valuable
commodities or lolling astraddle upon a burning beam hold the redhot
engine pipe in her hand and calmly direct the hissing water to
those points where it may be most effectually applied in our
various manufactories what essential services she might perform
in glasshouses for instance it is notorious that great mischief
sometimes arises from inability to ascertain when the sand and flint
have arrived at the proper degree fusion how completely might thisbe
remedied by merely shutting up the female salamander in the furnace
and i can really imagine nothing more interesting than to contemplate
her in that situation dressed in an asbestos pelisse watching the
reproduction a phoenix hung up in an iron cage by her side fondling
a sprite little salamander and bathing her naked feet in the vitreous
lava to report upon the intensity heat much more might be urged
to draw the attention government to the propriety retaining this
antiignitible young lady not only for the benefits she may confer upon
the public but for the example she may afford to others her own
sex that by a proper exertion courage the most ardent sparks may be
sometimes encountered without the smallest inconvenience or injury
 indulging in this playful vein raillery they now reached
that part the city road intersected by the regent's canal where its
spacious basin circumjacent wharfs and warehouses and winding line 
water with barges gliding majestically on its placid wave where lately
appeared open fields arrayed in the verdure nature afforded full
scope for remark by mr dashall on the gigantic design and rapid
accomplishment by commercial enterprize the most stupendous
undertakings
this work incalculable public utility said mr dashall sprang
into being with the alacrity enchantment the same remark may
apply to every other improvement this vast metropolis so rapid in
execution that one thinks the wonderful lamp and the magnificent
palace aladdin erected in one night by the attendant genii
onwards towards merry islington here said dashall is the new
river this fine artificial stream is brought from two springs at chad
well and am well in hertfordshire for the supply london with water
it was finished in by sir hugh middleton a citizen london who
expended his whole fortune in this public undertaking the river withall
its windings is nearly miles in length it has sluices
and bridges over and under it a great number brooks and
watercourses have their passage in some places this canal is carried
through vales and in others through subterraneous passages it
terminates in a basin called the new river head close by from the
reservoir at islington the water is conveyed by main pipes underground
along the middle the principal streets and thence by leaden
pipes to the different houses thus by means the new river and
 the london bridge waterworks every house in the metropolis is
abundantly supplied with water at the expense each a few shillings
only per annum
 thus all through merry islington
these gambols he did play
john gilpin
this village islington is a large and populous place superior
both in size and appearance to many considerable towns in the country
observe the angel inn celebrated for its ordinary where you may
enjoy after a country ramble an excellent dinner on very moderate
terms apropos the angel inn ordinary some years ago it was
regularly every sunday attended by a thin meagre gaunt and bony
figure cadaverous aspect who excited amongst the other guests no
small degree dismay and not without cause denominated the wolf he
justified his pretensions to the appellation by his almost incredible
powers gormandizing for a quantum viands sufficient for six men
 moderate appetite would vanish on the magic contact his knife and
fork in the twinkling an eye in fact his voracity was considered
 boundless extent for he invariably and without cessation consumed
by wholesale so long as eatables remained on the table one day after
having essentially contributed to the demolition a baron beef and
devoured an entire shoulder lamb with a commensurate proportion 
bread roots vegetables c he pounced with the celerity a hawk
on a fine roast goose which unfortunately happened to have been just
then placed within the reach his annihilating fangs and in a very
short space time it was reduced to a skeleton having occasion for a
few minutes to leave the room the company in the meanwhile secreted the
bones the goose the waiter now entered for the purpose removing
the cloth casting his eyes round the room he seemed absorbed in
perplexity what is the matter asked one the company do you miss
arty thing yes sir the bones a goose why then you may save
yourself the trouble further search the gentleman just gone out
 modest manners and puny appetite has devoured the goose bones and
all the waiter lost no time in reporting the appalling fact to
his master who now more than ever was desirous getting rid the
glutton but how it was impossible to exclude him the ordinary or set
bounds to his appetite the only resource left was that buying him
off which was done at the rate one shilling per diem and the wolf
took his hebdomadary repast at a different ordinary from this also his
absence was purchased at the same rate as by the first speculating on
his gluttony he levied similar contributions on the proprietors the
principal ordinaries in the metropolis and environs and if the fellow
is still living i have no doubt his continuing to derive his
subsistence from the sources already described now what think you 
real life in london
 the wolf so denominated was less censurable for his
gluttony than the infamous purpose to which he applied it
otherwise he had a parallel in a man sublime genius
handel one day entered a tavern in the city and ordered six
mackay you are right to a letter the
sphinx is a monsterman and i sure enough am a munsterman
i know it what would'st thou sir felix o'o'grady
 the baronet felt surprised by this familiar recognition his
person and replied by observing that as the inquirer so well knew his
name he might also be acquainted with the nature his business
i partly guess it rejoined the seer and although i cannot
absolutely predict restitution thy lost property yet i foresee that
accident will throw the depredator in thy way when the suit may perhaps
find its way back to thy wardrobe now hence to thy business and i to
mine
the baronet having nothing further to ask withdrew accordingly and our
squire melvillehall was next ushered into the sanctum sanatorium 
bob was at a loss what to say not having prepared himself with any
reasonable pretext inquiry a silence a few moments was the
consequence and the squire having first reconnoitred the person the
conjurer who was arrayed in the appropriate costume his profession
scrutinized the apartment when the attention the visitor and visited
being again drawn to each other the soothsayer addressed himself to
tallyhoho in the following words
the shadows joy shall the mind appal
and the deathlight dimly flit round the hall
 him by base lucre who led astray
shall age into fruitless minion betray
the deathlight shall glimmer in melvillehall
and childless the lord the mansion fall
a wife when he weds vain ugly and old
though charms she brings forty thousand in gold
the squire was not prone to anger but that this fellow should interfere
with his private concerns and impute to him the intention forming a
most preposterous connexion under the influence avarice roused him
into a whirlwind passion rascal he exclaimed who take upon
you to predict the fate others are you aware your own vagabond
imposter here i grasp you nor will i quit my hold until i surrender
you into the hands justice and suiting the action to the word he
seized and shook the unfortunate seer to the manifest discomposure 
his bones who loudly and lamentably cried out for assistance alarmed
by the clamour dashall and the baronet rushed up stairs to whom the
squire stated the aggravation received and at the same time
his determination to bring the cheat to punishment the trembling
culprit sued for mercy conscious that he was amenable to correction asa
rogue and vagabond and if convicted as such would probably be sent
to expiate his offence in the treadingmill at brixton a place 
atonement for transgression which all others he dreaded the most
 unionhall hannah tompkins a miserable woman the
town was brought before r g chambers esq charged with
having robbed another the unfortunate class her
clothes it appeared that the prisoner had been liberated
from brixton prison on fridaylast after a confinement 
three weeks and that on coming out she was met by the
complainant catherine flynn by whom she was taken to a
comfortable lodging supplied with necessaries and treated
with great kindness the prisoner acted with propriety until
monday night during which she remained out in the streets
on tuesday morning at four o'clock she came home drenched
with rain the complainant desired her either to go to bed
or to light a fire and dry her clothes the prisoner did
neither and the complainant went to sleep at about seven
the latter awoke and missed her gown petticoat and

learned that her clothes were at a pawnbroker's shop where
they had been left a short time before by the prisoner

before the magistrates in this condition her hair was
hanging about her face which was swelled and discoloured by
the hardship the preceding night she did not deny that
she had stolen the clothes her poor benefactress but she
pleaded in her excuse that the condition her body from
the rain monday night was such that nothing but gin
could have saved her life and the only way she had 
getting that medicine was by pledging natty flynn's
clothes the magistrates asked the prisoner whether she had
not got enough the treadingmill at brixton the prisoner
begged for mercy's sake not to be sent to the treadingmill
she would prefer transportation for it was much more
honourable to go over the water than to be sent as a rogue
and vagabond to brixton she was sent back to prison it is
a remarkable fact that since the famous treadingmill has
been erected at brixton the business this office has
greatly declined the mill is so constructed that when a
man ventures to be idle in it he receives a knock on the
head from a piece wood which is put there to give them
notice what they ere to do
 the two ancient sybil from the lower regions having now
ascended the scene confusion united their voices with that the
astrologer and dashall and sir felix also interceding in his behalf
the squire yielded to the general entreaty and promised the soothsayer
forgiveness on condition that he disclosed the source whence he
derived information as to the baronet's family concerns the soothsayer
confessed that he had elicited intelligence from the servant who
in his simplicity had revealed so much his master's affairs as to
enable him the conjurer to sustain his reputation even with sir felix
himself whom from description he recognized on his first entrance and
by the same means and with equal ease identified the person the
squire melvillehall he added besides that he had frequently by
similar stratagem acquired intelligence that chance had more than once
favoured him by verifying his predictions and thus both his fame and
finances had obtained aggrandisement he now promised to relinquish
celestial for sublunary pursuits and depend for subsistence rather on
the exercise honest industry than on public credulity
thus far had matters proceeded when the baronet's servant thady was
announced the triumvirate anticipating some extraordinary occurrence
desired the soothsayer to resume his functions and give the valet
immediate audience while they retired into another apartment to wait
the result in a few minutes the servant was dismissed and the party
readmitted
chance said the augured has again befriended me i told you sir
felix that the depredator would be thrown in your way my prediction is
realized he has been accidentally encountered by your servant and is
now in safe custody
on this information our party turned homewards first leaving the
astrologer a pecuniary stimulation to projected amendment life
there seems nothing inherent vileness said the squire as they
walked onwards in this man's principles he may have been driven
by distress to his present pursuits and i feel happy that i did not
consign the poor devil to the merciless fangs the law as in the
moment irritation i had intended
by my conscience exclaimed sir felix i cannot discover that he
ought to be punished at all he has been picking up a scanty living by
preying on public credulity and from the same source thousands in this
metropolis derive affluent incomes and with patronage and impunity
 and added dashall in cases minor offence a welltimed
clemency is frequently both in policy and humanity preferable to
relentless severity
 as k to the wardrobe its rightful owner
this business happily concluded and the day not much beyond its
meridian the three friends again sallied forth in the direction
 bondstreet towards piccadilly as usual the loungers were
superabundant and ridiculous paired together and swerving continually
from the direct line it required some skilful manoeuvring to pass
them our friends had surmounted several such impediments when a new
obstruction to their progress presented itself a party exquisite
had linked themselves together and occupied the entire pavement
so that it was impossible to precede them without getting into the
carriageway thus greatly obstructing and inconveniencing all other
passengers lounging at a funeral pace and leaving not the smallest
opening it was evident that these effeminate animals had
purposely united themselves for public annoyance sir felix irritated
by this palpable outrage on decorum stepped forward with hasty
determined stride and coming unexpectedly and irresistibly in contact
broke at once the concatenated barrier to the great amusement as
well as accommodation the lookerson and total discomfiture the
exquisite who observing the resolute mien and robust form their
assailant not forgetting a formidable piece timber alias sprig
 shillaleagh which he bore in his hand prudently consulted their
safety and forbore resentment the interruption
 if in walking the streets london the passenger kept
the right hand side it would prevent the frequent
recurrence much jostling and confusion the laws the
road are observed on the carriageway in the metropolis most
minutely else the street would be in a continual blockade
but
the laws the road are a paradox quite
that puzzles the marvelling throng
for if on the left you are yet on the right
and if you are right you are wrong
the baronet's two associates very much approved his spirited
interference and dashall observed that these insignificant beings
whom sir felix had so properly reproved were to be seen thus
incommoding the public in all parts the metropolis but more
particularly westward that in crowded streets however for instance
in the direct line from charing cross to the royal exchange the
apparent exquisite are generally thieves and pickpockets who find
a harvest in this extensive scene business by artful depredation
either upon the unwary tradesman or equally unsuspecting passenger
whose wiper or tattler and sometimes both becomes the frequent produce
 their active ingenuity
the morning had been wet and although the flagway was dry yet the
carriageroad was dirty there are in all parts the metropolis
indigent objects both sexes who by sweeping the crossway pick up
an eleemosynary livelihood it not unfrequently happens however that
a chariot or other vehicle is drawn up at one the crossway
directly athwart it so as completely to intercept your way to the
pavement exactly so situated were our pedestrians they had availed
themselves a newly swept path and were advancing towards the
opposite side in piccadilly when before they could effect
their purpose a carriage drew up and effectually impeded further
progress by the crossway so that there seemed no alternative between
standing fast and gaining the pavement by walking through the mud the
coachman retained his position despite remonstrance and in this
laudable stubbornness he was encouraged by a wellattired female inside
the vehicle for the carriage was a private one and its illmannered
inmate probably a lady rank and fashion sir felix justly indignant
at this treatment set danger and inconvenience at defiance and
deliberately walking to the horses heads led the animals forward until
the carriage had cleared the crossway maugre the threats the lady
and the whip the coachman who had the audacity to attempt exercising
it on the person the baronet when tallyhoho dreading the consequences
to the rash assailant sprang upon the box and arresting his hand
saved the honour munster the transaction did not occupy above two
minutes yet a number people had collected and vehemently applauded
sir felix and the lady's companion now hastily reentering the chariot
from an adjacent shop mr jehu drove off rapidly amidst the hoots and
hisses the multitude
 sir felix had not heard the following incident else he
certainly would have followed its example
two ladies distinction stopped in a carriage at a
jeweller's near charingcross one them only got out and
the coach stood across the pathway which some gentlemen
wanted to cross to the other side and desired the coachman
to move on a little the fellow was surly and refused the
gentlemen remonstrated but in vain during the altercation
the lady came to the shop door and foolishly ordered the
coachman not to stir from his place on this one the
gentlemen opened the coachdoor and with boots and spurs
stepped through the carriage he was followed by his
companions to the extreme discomposure the lady within
as well as the lady without to complete the jest a party
 sailors coming up observed that if this was a
thoroughfare they had as much right to it as the penmen
and accordingly scrambled through the carriage
the poor streetsweeper having applied to sir felix for a mite
 benevolence and is it for letting the carriage block up the
crossway and forcing me through the mud asked the baronet but
whether or not i have not got any halfpence about me so that i must
pay you when i come again ah your honour exclaimed the man it
is unknown the credit i give in this way sir felix thrust his hand
into his pocket and rewarded the applicant with a tester
 proceeding along piccadilly our party were followed by
a newfoundland dog which circumstance attracted the notice the
baronet to whom more than to either his associates the animal seemed
to attach itself pleased with its attention sir felix caressed it and
when the triumvirate entered a neighbouring coffeehouse the dog was
permitted to accompany them scarcely had the three friends seated
themselves when a man decent appearance came into the room and
without ceremony accused the baronet having by surreptitious means
obtained possession his property in other words having inveigled
away his dog and demanding instant restitution
sir felix fired at the accusation divested as it was the shadow 
truth yet unsuspicious design would have instantly relinquished his
canine acquaintance but for the interposition dashall who suspected
this intrusive personage to be neither more nor less than a dogstealer
 whom there are many in london continually on the alert for booty
these fellows pick up all stray dogs carry them home and detain them
until such time as they are advertised and a commensurate reward is
offered by the respective owners if then the dog is intrinsically
 no value and consequently unsaleable the adept in this species 
depredation finding he can do no better takes the dog home
receives the promised reward and generally an additional gratuity in
compensation keep and trouble but should it so happen that the
proffered remuneration is not equivalent to the worth the animal the
conscientious professor knavery carries his goods to a more lucrative
market at the instance dashall therefore sir felix was determined
to retain the animal until the claimant brought irrefragable proof
 ownership the fellow blustered the baronet was immovable in his
resolution when the other threw off all disguise and exhibiting
himself in pristine blackguardism inundated sir felix pertained rose like
many others the children industry from comparative indigence to
affluence and from obscurity to eminence
the party was select the dinner was sumptuous yet unostentatious and
the conversation if not exactly in the first class refinement was
to the two strangers interestingly instructive as embracing topics 
mercantile pursuit with which they had hitherto been unacquainted it
was also highly enlivened by the sprightly sallies three beautiful
and elegantly accomplished young ladies the daughters the amiable
host and hostess and to these fair magnets attraction whom dashall
happily denominated the graces our gallant cavaliers were particularly
assiduous in their attentions the party broke up after an evening 
reciprocal enjoyment and dashall on the way home expressed his belief
that with the solitary exception one colossal instance ignorance
and brutality the very respectable man in society is most generally
to be found among the merchants london
 the very respectable man is the true representative 
the commercial character great britain he possesses more
information than the dutch trader and more refinement than
the scotch manufacturer with all the business
qualifications either he is shrewd industrious manly
and independent and as he is too much in earnest for the
slightest affectation he shews his character in his dress
his carriage and his general appearance his dress is at
once plain and neat and if his coat should accidentally
exhibit the cut a more genteel manufacturer the
interstice between his boot he wears top boots and smallclothes
the fashion his cravat which is rolled round a
stiffer two inches in diameter and tied in a bow besides
a variety other more minute characteristics decidedly
refute all suspicion an attempt at attaining the
appearance a man fashion the a spitalfields
silkhandkerchief just appearing from the pocket hole at the
top his skirt shews at once his regard for good things
and native manufactures while the dignity his tread
declares his consciousness his own importance the
importance a very respectable man and to attribute it
to any other than such an honest pride would be
derogatory to his reputation and feelings if he meets a
business acquaintance an higher rank than his own his
respectful yet unembarrassed salutation at once sufficiently
expresses the disparity their two conditions and his
consciousness the respectability his own while the
respectfully condescending notice the peer exhibits the
reversed flow the same feelings the very respectable
man is always accurately acquainted with the hackney coach
fares to the different parts london and any attempt at
imposition on the part the coachman is sure to be
detected and punished he is never to be caught walking to
the bank on a public holiday and the wind must have shifted
very fast indeed if it should happen to be in the north
when he believes it to be in the south the state the
stocks is familiar to him and as he watches their
fluctuations with an attentive eye their history for weeks
or even for months is often in his memory the very
respectable man is always employed but never in a hurry
and he perhaps is never better pleased than when he meets a
congenial friend who interrupts the current business by
the introduction a mutual discussion some important
failure mr suchaone's rapid acquirement fortune the
rise or fall the funds c all which the causes or
consequences are importantly whispered or significantly
prophesied at home the government the very respectable
man's family is arbitrary but the governor is not a tyrant
his wife has not like the woman fashion any distinct
rights but she enjoys extensive indulgences she has
power but it flows from him and though she is a
responsible she is not a discretional agent the table is
to correspond with the moderation the master and the
matron will be scolded or reproved as it varies from the
proper medium between meanness and profusion
the very respectable man is never less in his element than
when he is in the centre his wife's parties for here he
must resign the reins into her hands and alas there is no
such character as the very respectable woman all our women
would be women fashion and in dress and expense in the
numbers their card tables and the splendour their
parties in every thing but manners they are here at his
own fireside the very respectable man may be considered as
not at home till a rubber a genial rubber which is
provided him as soon as possible renders him blind to the
folly and deaf to the clamour the scene the very
respectable man shews to least advantage as a politician
as his opinions are derived less from reading than
experience they are apt to be dogmatical and contracted in
political philosophy he is too frequently half a century
behind his age is still in the habit considering specie
as wealth and talks loudly the commercial benefits 
the late war such is the very respectable man a
character decidedly inferior to that many individuals in
the class society immediately above him but which
considered as the character a class appears to be
superior at once to that above and that below it on a
comparison with that above too it more than makes up in the
mass its virtues for the deficiency in their quality and
appears to be like solon's laws if not the very best that
might be at least the best which the state society
admits in the lower orders the social character is in its
mineral state in the higher the fineness the gold is
prejudicial to its durability in the very respectable manit
is found mixed with some portion alloy but in
greater quantity and adapted to all the uses and purposes
for which it is designed as a civil member society if
his theoretical politics are defective the advantages
derived to society from his industry and integrity more
than counterbalance those defects in his theory as a
religious member society if his religion might be more
refined if his attendance at church is considered rather asa
parochial than a spiritual duty and his appearance in his
own pew is at least as much regarded as his devotions there
the regularity his attendance the harmony his
principles and practice his exemplary manner filling his
different relations more than make up for the inferiority
in the tone his religion the commercial and religious
capital society are in short continually advancing by
his exertions though they don't advance so fast as they
otherwise would if those exertions were directed by more
intellect
chapter xxiv
vainly bountiful nature shall fill up life's measure
if we're not to enjoyment awake
churls that cautiously filtrate and analyze pleasure
deserve not the little they take
i hate all those pleasures where angling and squaring
and fitting and cutting by rules
and me dear me i beg pardon for swearing
all that follow such fashions are fools
for let who may be undone
i say life in london
 pleasure's the prop and the staff
that sets ev'ry muscle
in a comical bustle
and tickles one into a laugh

the long protracted visit to vauxhall being at length finally arranged
our party soon found themselves in the midst this gay and fascinating
scene amusement
these charming gardens said the hon tom dashall which you may
perhaps have some recollection upon a masquerade occasion having
lately fallen into new hands have assumed under their direction and
management a new appearance additional splendour and magnificence
perhaps scarcely ever surpassed and the present proprietors appear to
have studied the comfort and gratification their visitors as well as
their own advantage but this we shall be better judges before the
night is spent
right replied sparkle i am not fond far fetched descriptions
which may upon investigation prove to have originated more in the
imagination the author than in reality to exist
at all events continued tom the gardens themselves are beautiful
and extensive and contain a variety walks which if but tastefully
illuminated and attended by rank fashion and beauty can never fail
to be attractive
 our heroes rushed forward to the splendid scene enchantment
which had drawn forth the previous observations mingling with the
crowds well dressed persons who like themselves were upon the alert
to witness this delightful place summer amusement in the new form
which it has recently assumed the veranda tastefully festooned with
painted canvass the brilliantly illuminated orchestra and the animated
countenances the company conspired to produce an effect almost
inconceivable while new objects delight were continually bursting
upon their view the illuminated colonnade newly decorated with carved
and painted flowers fruit and foliage and mr singleton's original
whole length transparent portrait his majesty in his coronation
robes alternately attracted attention as well as the four cormorants
constructed in various parts the gardens consisting some very
pretty views the new exchange at paris scenes in switzerland c in
the musical department sparkle was much pleased to find some the old
favourites particularly mr charles taylor and mrs bland as well as
with the performance a miss grafton who possesses a rich voice
with considerable power and flexibility and madame georgia an
east indian lady who afterwards sung very charmingly in the rotunda
accompanying herself on the piano forte in a style which proved her to
be a most skilful performer
but the grand subject their admiration was what is rather affectedly
called the heptaplasiesoptron or fancy reflective proscenium which
is placed in the long room fronting the orchestra the rotunda
it is entirely lined with looking glass and has in all probability
originated in the curious effect produced by the kaleidoscope and the
looking glass curtains lately exhibited at our theatres this splendid
exhibition is fitted up with ornamented draperies and presents a
fountain real water illuminated revolving pillars palm trees
serpents foliage and variegated lamps and the mirrors are so placed
as to reflect each object seven times this novelty appeared to excite
universal admiration inspiring the company with ideas refreshing
coolness the bubbling water the waving the foliage and the
seven times reflected effulgence the lamps gave the whole an
appearance enchantment which sets all description at defiance
 having taken a complete circle through this round delights
interrupted only by the congratulations and inquiries friends the
appointed hour for exhibiting the fireworks arrived when they were
additionally gratified by a display the most splendid description
and the famous ascent a la saqui was admirably executed by longuemarc
after witnessing which they quickly retired to a box where they gave
directions for supper it is but justice to say that upon this being
furnished they found the refreshments to be the best quality and
supplied upon moderate terms the wines by the london wine company and
the viands by mr waste
about two o'clock in the morning our friends took their departure
from this romantic spot after an excursion fraught with pleasure and
delight
on the following morning sparkle received a letter from merrywell
with information the death his uncle and his succession to
the estate having arrived just in time to prevent his decease without a
will this was a subject exultation to all the party though to none
more so than sparkle particularly as the estate alluded to was situated
in the neighbourhood his own residence
merrywell said dashall will become a gay fellow now as he will
have ample means as well as inclination which i know he has never been
wanting to sport his figure in good style without resorting to any
scheme to keep the game alive
true said sparkle without crossing and jostling and if he has
his own good in view he will reside chiefly in the country choose
an amiable partner for life and only pay a visit to the metropolis
occasionally for to live in this land temptations where you can
hardly step across the way without getting into error must be baneful
in effect to a young man like him an ardent mind what say you
friend tallyhoho
i confess replied bob that i entertain thoughts very similar
to yours besides i apprehend that our old friend merrywell has had
sufficient experience himself to admit the justice your observation
 pshaw rejoined dashall you are getting completely
unfashionable what can be more bang up than a life in london high life
and low life shake the castor tip the flash and nibble the blunt
look for instance at young lord lappet cares for nothing all blood and
spirit fire and tow up to every thing and down as a hammer
his is a general case replied sparkle and is only one among
numerous others to prove that many the disorders which are daily
visible in high life may be traced to the education or rather the want
 education the youthful nobility and gentry it would be a shocking
and insupportable degradation to send a sprig fashion to school among
common boys where probably he might learn something really useful no
no he must have a private tutor who is previously instructed to teach
him nothing more than what will enable him to pass muster as not quite
a fool under this guidance he skims over a few authors almost without
reading and at all events without knowing what they have written
merely with a view to acquaint him that there were once such persons inexistence
after which this tutor accompanies him to one the public
schools westminster harrow or eton where the tutor writes his
thesis translates the classics and makes verses for him as well ashe
is able in the new situation the scholar picks up more the
frailties the living than he does the instructions departed
characters the family connections and the power purse with which
the students are aided embolden them to assume an unbounded license
and to set at complete defiance all sober rules and regulations and it
may be justly remarked that our public seminaries are admirably situated
for the indulgence their propensities for instance westminster
school is fortunately situated in the immediate neighbourhood a
famous place instruction called tothill vulgarly tuttle fields
where every species refined lewdness and debauchery and manners the
most depraved are constantly exhibited consequently they enjoy the
great advantages learning the slang language and hearing prime
chaunts rum glees and kiddy catches in the purest and most bang up
style he has likewise a fine opportunity contracting an unalterable
penchant for the frail sisterhood blue ruin milling cock fighting
bull and badger baiting donkey racing drinking swearing swaggering
and other refined amusements so necessary to form the character an
accomplished gentleman
 again harrow school is happily so near to the metropolis as
to afford frequent opportunities for occasional visits to similar scenes
 contagion and fashionable dissipation that the scholars do not fail
to seek advantages taking lessons in all those delectable sciences
eton it is true is somewhat farther removed from the nursery 
improvement but it is near enough to windsor which place it is not
necessary to say much for their bacchanalian and cyprian orgies and
other fashionable festivities are well known so that notwithstanding
they are not in the immediate vicinity the metropolis there can
scarcely be a doubt their being able to sport their figures to
advantage whenever they are let loose upon society
cambridge is but a short distance from that place sporting
notoriety newmarket consequently it is next to impossible but that a
youth an aspiring mind should be up to all the manoeuvres a racecourse
understanding betting hedging off crossing and jostling
sweating and training know all the jockeys how to give or take the
odds lay it on thick and come it strong some have an unconquerable
ambition to distinguish themselves as a whip sport their tits in tiptop
style and become proficient in buckish and sporting slang to
pitch it rum and astonish the natives up to the gab the cad they
take upon themselves the dress and manners the garment club yet
noted for the appearance their prays and the dexterity with which
they can manage the ribbons and like goldfinch pride themselves on
driving the long coaches mount the box tip coaches a crown dash
along at full speed rattle down the gateway take care your
heads never kill'd but one woman and a child in all my life that's
your sort
fine pictures a university education said tom but sparkle always
was a good delineator real character and there is one thing to be
said he has been an eye witness the facts nay a partaker the
sports
true continued sparkle and like many others have had something
like enjoyment in them too
aye aye no doubt that said bob dryly but how does it happen
that you have omitted oxford altogether
 nay said sparkle there is not much difference in any 
them the students hate all learning but that which they acquire in the
brothel the ring or the stable
they spend their terms somehow or other in or near the university and
their vacations at jackson's rooms in london so that they know nothing
more mathematics than sufficient to calculate odds and chances this
however depends upon the wealth the parties for notwithstanding
there are some excellent statutes by which they ought to be guided
a nobleman or wealthy commoner is indulged according to his titles or
riches without any regard to the rules and regulations in such cases
made and provided
from this situation they are at length let loose thoroughly
accomplished in every thing but what they ought to know some make their
appearance as exquisite or dandies a sort indescribable being if
being such things may be called others take the example the bang
ups make themselves perfect in milling swearing greeting talking
flash and mail coach driving until john doe and richard roe drive them
into abbot's preserve a circumstance which puts a temporary check upon
the sports though if the collegian is but up to the logic he is very
soon down upon the coves his creditors bowls them out by harassing
expenses and walks out himself up to snuff and fly
 bowls them out by harassing expenses a proof the
power which has been exercised under the existing insolvent
debtor's act will be found in the following extract from a
daily paper
an unfortunate debtor was opposed in the insolvent debtors
court for having resisted particular creditors with
vexatious law proceedings sham pleas c the public is not
generally aware the extent to which such vexatious
resistance can be carried in the investigations that have
taken place before a committee the house commons on
the subject insolvent debtors mr thomas clarke at the
time clerk the court stated that in a debtor's he
found a paper wherein it was pointed out to debtors how to
harass creditors he had heard he said that it was sold
from one prisoner to another in a printed form for d
each that witness then delivered to the committee a 
from which the following extract was read it is extracted
from the parliamentary report
law proceedings when arrested and held to bail and after
being served with a declaration you may plead a general
issue which brings you to trial the sooner any plea that
you can put in but if you want to vex your plaintiff put
in a special plea and if in custody get your attorney to
plead in your name which will cost you l s your
plaintiff l as expenses if you do not mean to try the
cause you have no occasion to do so until your plaintiff
gets judgment against you he must in the term after you
put in a special plea send what is termed the paper 
which you must return with s d otherwise you will not
put him to half the expenses when he proceeds and has
received a final judgment against you get your attorney to
search the office appointed for that purpose in the temple
and when he finds that judgment is actually signed he must
give notice to the plaintiff's attorney to attend the master
to tax his costs at which time your attorney must have a
writ error ready and give it to the plaintiffs attorney
before the master which puts him to a very great expense
as he will have the same charges to go over again the writ
 error will cost you l s if you want to be further
troublesome to your plaintiffs make your writ error
returnable in parliament which costs you l s and your
plaintiff should he have the courage to follow you
through all your proceedings then file a bill in the
exchequer which will cost about l or l and if he
answers it it will cost him sol more after this you may
file a bill in chancery which will cost about l and if
he does not answer this bill you will get an injunction
and at the same time an attachment from the court against
him and may take his body for contempt court in not
answering your last bill you may file your bill in the
court chancery instead the exchequer only the latter
costs you the least if you are at any time served with a
copy a writ take no further notice it than by keeping
it when you are declared against do not fail to put in a
special plea immediately and most likely you will hear no
more the business as your plaintiff will probably not
like to incur any further expense after having been at so
much
thus a creditor may be put to an expense three hundred
and fourteen pounds by a debtor for the small cost l
s and all because the laws allowed him to sue for his
own and if he and his attorney do not keep a sharp lookout
the creditor may get committed for contempt court
 i perceive said tom that your imagination is flying
away from your subject though i admit the justice your remarks as
generally applicable to what is termed the higher ranks society
and that they are imitated or aped in succession to those the lower
orders but we appear to have imperceptibly got into a long descriptive
conversation instead pursuing our usual plan drawing inferences
from actual observation let us toto get in with now my masters you please and seems quite as much
at home as mr matthews at the lyceum with all that sort thing and
every thing in the world he is however not singular in his taste
for many our hereditary statesmen are to be found among this class
save and except that he carries his imitations to a farther extent than
any person i ever knew and it is a fact that he had one his foreteeth
punched out in order to enable the noble aspirant to give the
true coachman's whistle and to spit in a jehulike manner so as to
project the saliva from his lips clear the cattle and traces into
the hedge on the near side the road
accomplishments that are truly deserving the best considerations a
noble mind rejoined tallyhoho
and absolutely necessary to the finished gentleman the present day
 course continued sparkle and as i have not had a lounge in these
corinthian regions for some little time i am glad to be thus furnished
with a key to characters that may be new to me
there is one on the opposite side the way not altogether new as he
has made some noise in the world during his time i mean the gentleman
whose features exhibit so much the rouge it is the celebrated sir
george skippington formerly well known in fop's alley and at the
opera not so much on account his elegant person lively wit
or polished address as for his gallantries and an extraordinary
affectation dress approaching very nearly to the ridiculous the
chief part his reputation being derived from wearing a peagreen
coat and pink silk stockings he has however since that time become
a dramatic writer or at least a manufacturer pantomime and shew
and ah but see speaking writers here we have a hook from which
is suspended a certain scandalous journal well known for its dastardly
attacks upon private character and whose nominal conductors are at this
moment in durance vile but a certain affair in the fashionable way 
defaulting has brought him down a peg or two his ingenuity has been
displayed on a variety occasions and under varying circumstances
his theatrical attempts have been successful and at harrow he was
called the green man in consequence his affected singularity 
wearing a complete suit clothes that colour he appears to act
at all times upon the favourite recommendation young rapid keep
moving for he is always in motion in consequence which it is said
that lord byron wittily remarked he certainly was not the green man
and still
 the green man and still in the well known sign a
pubichouse in oxford road
 why cried bob there seems to be as little still life
about him just now as there is about hookey walker but pray who is
that dingy gentleman who passed us within the last minute and who
appeared to be an object attraction to some persons on the opposite
side he appears to have been cut out for a tailor
that replied tom is a baronet and cornet who married the handsome
daughter a great marquis she however turned out a complete
termagant who one day in the heat her rage d d her rib fora
sneaking puppy dashed a cup coffee in his face and immediately
after flew for protection to a noble lord who entertained a penchant
for her this however proved to be a bad speculation on her part and
having seriously reflected on the consequences such conduct she made
her appearance again at her husband's door a few nights afterwards and
in the spirit contrition sought forgiveness under a promise never
transgressing any more little doubting but her claim to admission would
be allowed here however it seems she had reckoned without her
host for the baronet differing in opinion would not listen to her
proposition her entreaties and promises were urged in vain and the
deserted though still care sposa has kept the portals his door as
well as the avenues to his heart completely closed to her since
at this moment they were interrupted by the approach a gaily dressed
young man who seizing dashall by the hand and giving him a hearty
shake exclaimed
ha my dear fellow what dashall and as i live mr sparkle you are
there too are you d me what's the scent up to any thing going
any where or any thing to do eh d me
quite ad libitum replied dashall happy to see gayfield well and
in prime twig allow me to introduce my cousin robert tallyhoho esq
you do me proud my dear fellow any thing new can't live without
novelty who's up who's down what's the wonder the day how does
the world wag where is the haven destination and how do you weather
the point
 zounds replied tom you ask more questions in a breath than
we three can answer in an hour
never mind don't want you to answer but at all events must have
something to say hate idleness either in speech or action hate talking
in the streets can't bear staring at like a new monument or a statue
talking statues i have it good thought go see achilles the
ladies man eh what say you d me made cannons and other
combustibles waterloo to wit come along quite a bore to standstill
yea or nay can't wait
with all my heart said sparkle twitching dashall by the arm it
is quite new since my departure from town and joining arms they
proceeded towards the park
been out town continued gayfield thought so lost you all
at once glad you have not lost yourself any thing new in the
country always inquire can't live without novelty go to see everything
and every body every where nothing new in the papers irish
distresses old but very distressing for a time how the devil can you
live in the country can't imagine
and i apprehend replied sparkle it will be little use to
explain for a gentleman so much information as yourself must know
every thing
good but severe never mind i never trouble my head with other
people's thoughts always think for myself let others do as they like
hate inquisitive people don't choose to satisfy all inquirers never
ask questions any one don't expect answers have you seen the
celebrated ventriloquist alexandre the egyptian tomb the 
sparkle could hold no longer the vanity and egotism this everlasting
prater this rambler from subject to subject without manner method
or even thought was too much and he could not resist the temptation to
laugh in which he was joined by tom and bob
 what is the matter inquired gayfield unconscious being
the cause their risibility i see nothing to laugh at d me
but i do love laughing so i'll enjoy a little with you at all events
and immediately he became a participator in their mirth to the
inexpressible delight his companions but continued he i see
nothing to laugh at and it is beneath the character a philosopher to
laugh at any thing
never mind said dashall we are not that description and we
sometimes laugh at nothing which i apprehend is the case in the present
instance
i perfectly agree with the observation rejoined sparkle it is a
case in point and very well pointed too
nothing could be better timed said tallyhoho
what than a horse laugh in the public streets d d vulgar
reallyquite outre as we say no no you ought to consider
where you are what company you are in and never laugh without a good
motive what is the use laughing
a philosopher said tom dashall need scarcely ask such a question
the superiority his mind ought to furnish a sufficient answer
then i perceive you are not communicative and i always like to be
informed but never mind here we shall have something to entertain us
and at least said sparkle that is better than nothing
the observation however was lost upon the incorrigible fribblerm although that
term is universally applied to it inasmuch as this statue
is not naked the modest artist having at the suggestion 
these modest ladies taken the precaution giving achilles
a covering similar to that which adam and eve wore on their
expulsion from eden
 the attitude the statue is so questionable as to have
already raised many opposite hypotheses as to what it is
really intended to represent mr exsheriff perkins has
with very laudable ingenuity and classical taste
discovered that the figure is nothing more nor less than a
syne or running groom just such a one the worthy exsheriff
adds as used to accompany him in india when
engaged in a hunting party and who when he grew tired
used to lay hold the exsheriff's horse's tail in order
to keep up with his master the author the travestie
however has hit upon another solution the attitude
still more novel and equally probable namely that 
dancing for which he expects to gain no inconsiderable
share popularity
 without a shirt or highland skirt it is really
entertaining to see what a refinement criticism has been
displayed upon the defects this incomparable statue some
have abused the hero for being shirtless and said it was an
abomination to think that a statue in a state nudity
much larger than life too should be stuck up in hyde
park where every lady's eye must glance however repugnant
it might be to their ideas modesty but did not the
ladies themselves order and pay for the said statue is it
not an emblem their own pure taste then as for
putting on achilles a kelt or short petticoat called by the
poet a highland skirt oh shocking i it is not only
unclassical but it would have destroyed the effect the
thing altogether to be sure it would not be the first time
that achilles wore a petticoat for if we are rightly
informed his mother thetis disguised him in female
apparel and hid him among the maidens at the court 
lycomedes iu order to prevent his going to the siege 
troy but that wicked wag ulysses calling on the said
maidens to pay his respects discovered mister achilles
among them and made him join his regiment
each widow's heart is throbbing
each married lady sobbing
while little miss
would fain a kiss
be from achilles robbing
then oh the sight entrancing
to see achilles dancing
without a shirt
or highland skirt
where ladies eyes are glancing
oh tis not helm or feather
or breeches made leather
that gave delight
by day or night
or draw fair crowds together
let those wear clothes who need em
adorn but max with freedom's
then light or dark
they'll range the park
and follow where you lead em
for oh the sight's entrancing
to see achilles dancing
without a shirt
or highland skirt
where ladies eyes are glancing
 if we could only insert one hundredth part what has
been said by widows wives and maids on this interesting
subject during the present week we are quite sure our
readers would acquit us having overcharged the picture
or even faintly delineated it
 we certainly must differ with the author here in our
humble opinion helmets feathers leather breeches c
have a wonderful effect in drawing crowds the fair sex
together at a grand review for instance
 this line it is hoped will be understood literally the
words are t moore's and breathe the spirit liberty not
licentiousness
 having succeeded in their object dashall and his cousin
pursued their course homeward and thus terminated another day spent in
the development real life in the british metropolis
but still the muse beseeches
if this epistle reaches
achilles bold
in winter cold
that he would wear his breeches
for though in sultry weather
he needs not cloth nor leather
yet frosts may mar
what's safe in war
and ruin all together
but still the sight's entrancing
to see achilles dancing
without a shirt
or highland skirt
where ladies eyes are glancing
 the last verse must be allowed to be truly considerate
nay kind that the ladies will be equally kind and
considerate to poor achilles as the poet is must be the
wish every one who has witnessed the perilous situation
in which he is placed
 achilles was a great favourite with the ladies from his
very birth he was a fine strapping boy and his mother was
so proud him that she readily encountered the danger 
being drowned in the river styx herself that she might dip
her darling in it and thereby render him invulnerable
accordingly every part the hero was safe except his
heel by which his mother held him amidst the heat 
battle and like his renowned antitype the immortal duke
 wellington he was never wounded but at length when
achilles was in the temple treating about his marriage with
philomela daughter priam the brother hector let fly
an arrow at his vulnerable heel and did his business in a
twinkling
we cannot quit this subject without paying a compliment to the virtues
 the court we understand there has not been one royal carriage seen
in the park since the erection the statue and if report speaks true
the marchioness c m's delicacy is so shocked that she intends to
quit hamilton place which is close by as early as a more modest site
can be chosen
chapter xxv
lack a day what a gay
what a wonderful great town
in each street thousands meet
all parading up and down
crossing jostling strutting running
hither thither going coming
hurry scurry pushing driving
ever something new contriving
oh what a place what a strange london town
on every side both far and wide we hear its renown

escorting to the evervarying promenade fashion the hon tom dashall
and his cousin bob whose long protracted investigation life in
london was now drawing to a close proceeded this morning to amuse
themselves with another lounge in bondstreet this arcadia dignified
equality was thronged the carriageway with dashing equipages and
the pave with exquisite pedestrians here was one rouged and whiskered
there another in petticoats and stays while his sister like an amazon
shewed her nether garments half way to the knee then passed smiling
by a corinthian bear in an upper benjamin and a jolliffe shallow a
noted milliner shone in a richer pelisse than the countess whom the day
before she had cheated out the lace which adorned it the gentleman
with the dayrule in new buckskins and boots and mounted on a
thoroughbred horse quizzed his retaining creditor as he trotted along
with dusty shoes and coat the lady easy virtue stared her keeper's
wife and daughter out countenance the man milliner's shopboy enpassant
 jogged the duke's elbow and the dandy pickpocket lisped and
minced his words quite as well as my lord
tom pointed out some the more dashing inhabitants and bob inquiring
the name a fine woman rather en bon point with a french face who
was mounted on a chesnut hunter and whom he had never before seen in
the his was mrs sullivan's story and she told it with such
pathos that all who heard it pitied her except her
husband
it was now mr sullivan's turn to speak whilst his wife was
speaking he had stood with his back towards her his arms
folded across his breast to keep down his choler biting his
lips and staring at the blank wall but the moment she had
ceased he abruptly turned round and curiously enough
asked the magistrate whether mistress sullivan had done
speaking
she has replied his worship but suppose you ask her
whether she has any thing more to say
i shall sir exclaimed the angry mr sullivan mistress
sullivan had you any more it to say 
mrs sullivan raised her eyes to the ceiling clasped her
hands together and was silent
very well then he continued will i get lave to spake
your honour
his honour nodded permission and mr sullivan immediately
began a defence to which it is impossible to do justice so
exuberantly did he suit the action to the word and the
word to the action och your honour there is something
the matter with me he began at the same time putting two
 his fingers perpendicularly over his forehead to
intimate that mrs sullivan played him false he then went
into a long story about a misther burke who lodged in his
house and had taken the liberty assisting him in his
conjugal duties without any lave from him at all at all
it was one night in particular he said that he went to bed
betimes in the little back parlour quite entirely sick with
the headache misther burke was out from home and when the
shop was shut up mrs sullivan went out too but he didn't
much care for that only he thought she might as well have
staid at home and so he couldn't go to sleep for thinking
 it well at one o'clock in the morning he continued
lowerking his voice into a sort loud whisper at one
o'clock in the mornking misther burke lets himself in with
the key that he had and goes up to bed and i thought
nothing at all but presently i hears something come tap
tap tap at the street door the minute after comes down
misther burke and opens the door and sure it was mary
mistress sullivan that is more's the pity and devil a bit
she came to see after me at all in the little back parlour
but up stairs she goes after misther burke och says but
there's something the matter with me this night and i got
up with the nightcap o th head me and went into the
shop to see for a knife but i couldn't get one by no manes
so i creeps up stairs step by step step by step here
mr sullivan walked on tiptoe all across the office to show
the magistrate how quietly he went up the stairs and when
i gets to the top i sees em by the gash gas coming
through the chink in the window curtains i sees em and
och mistress sullivan says he and och misther burke
says she and och botheration says i to myself and what
shall i do now we cannot follow mr sullivan any farther
in the detail his melancholy affair it is sufficient
that he saw enough to convince him that he was dishonoured
that by some accident or other he disturbed the guilty
pair whereupon mrs sullivan crept under mr burke's bed
to hide herself that mr sullivan rushed into the room and
dragged her from under the bed by her wicked leg and
that he felt about the round table in the corner where mr
burke kept his bread and cheese in the hope finding a
knife
and what would you have done with it if you had found it
asked his worship
is it what i would have done with it your honour asks
exclaimed mr sullivan almost choked with rage is it what
i would have done with it only that i'd have digged it
into the heart em at the same time as he said this he
threw himself into an attitude wild desperation and made
a tremendous lunge as if in the very act slaughter
to make short a long story he did not find the knife
mr burke barricaded himself in his room and mr sullivan
turned his wife out doors
the magistrate ordered him to find bail to keep the peace
towards his wife and all the king's subjects and told him
that if his wife was indeed what he had represented her to
be he must seek some less violent mode separation than
the knife
there not being any other case interest tom and bob left
the office not however without a feeling commiseration
for mr sullivan whose frail rib and her companion in
iniquity now that the tables were turned against them by
the injured husband's plain unvarnished tale experienced
a due share reprobation from the auditory
 pursuing their course homeward through st jamessquare
who have we here exclaimed tom as i live no other than the
lofty honoris an authoress a wit and an eccentric a combination
 qualities which frequently contribute to convey the possessor to a
garret and thence to an hospital or poor house it is not uncommon to
find attic salt in the first floor from heaven but rather difficult
to find the occupier enabled to procure salt whereby to render porridge
palatable the lady honoris who has just passed resides in a lodging
in marylebone she having mistaken stature for beauty and attitude
for greatness a tune on her lute for fascination a few strange
opinions and out the way sayings for genius a masculine appearance
for attraction and bulk for irresistibility came on a cruise to london
with a view to call at c house where she conceived she might be
treated like a princess
she fondly fancied that a certain dignified personage who relieved her
distress could not but be captivated with the very description her
in consequence which she launched into expenses which she was but
ill able to bear and now complains designs formed against her and 
all sorts fabulous nonsense it must however be acknowledged that
an extraordinary taste for fat has been a great somce inconvenience
to the illustrious character alluded to for corpulent women have been
in the habit daily throwing themselves in his way under some pretence
or other and if he but looked at them they have considered themselves
as favourites and in the high road to riches and fame
it is well known that a certain french woman with long flowing black
hair who lived not an hundred miles from publico was one who fell into
this error her weight is about sixteen stone and on that account she
sets herself down as this illustrious person's mistress nay because he
saw her once she took expensive lodgings ran deeply in debt and now
abuses the great man because he has not provided for her in a princely
style pour se beaux yeux for it must be admitted that she can boast
as fine a pair black eyes as ever were seen the circumstance 
this taste for materialism is as unfortunate to the possessor as a
convulsive nod the head once was to a rich gentleman who was never
without being engaged in some law suit or other for lots knocked down
to him at auctions owing to his incessant and involuntary nodding at
these places the fat ladies wish the illustrious amateur to pay for
peeping just as the crafty knights the hammer endeavoured to make
the rich gentleman pay for his nodding at them
fat fair and forty then said sparkle does not appear to be
forgotten
 no was the reply nor is it likely the wits london are
seldom idle upon subjects importance take for instance the following
lines
when first i met thee fat and fair
with forty charms about thee
a widow brisk and debonair 
how could i live without thee
thy roguish eye i quickly spied
it made me still the fonder
i swore though false to all beside
from thee i'd never wander
but old fitly now
thought only fit to tease me
and c m i vow
has learnt the art to please me
by this time they were passing grosvenor gate when the hon tom dashall
directed the attention his cousin to a person on the opposite side 
the street pacing along with a stiff and formal air
that said he is a new species character if it may properly be
so termed which i have never yet given you any account sir edward
knoweth stands however at the head a numerous and respectable class
 persons who may be entitled philosophic coxcombs he proceeds with
geometrical exactness in all his transactions you can perceive finery
 dress is no mark his character on the contrary he at all times
wears a plain coat and as if in ridicule the common fop takes care
to decorate his menials in the most gorgeous liveries
the stiffness and formality his appearance is partly occasioned by
the braces which he very judiciously purchased martin van butcher
and partly by the pride wealth and rank
there is a pensiveness in his aspect which would induce any one to
imagine sir edward to be a man feeling but those who have depended
upon outward appearances alone have found themselves miserably
deceived for as hypocrisy assumes a look sanctity so your
philosophic coxcomb's apparent melancholy serves only as a mask to cover
his stupidity
sir edward is amorously inclined but he consults his reason or
pretends to do so and by that means renders his pleasures subservient
to his health it cannot be denied he sometimes manifests contortions 
aspect not exactly in unison with happiness but his feelings are ever
selfish and his apparent pain is occasioned by the nausea a debauch
or perhaps by the pressure a new pair boots if you are in
distress sir edward hears your tale with the most stoical indifference
and he contemplates your happiness with an equal degree apathy a
sort epictetus who can witness the miseries a brother without
agony or sympathy and mark the elevation a friend without one
sentiment congratulation wrapt up in self he banishes all feeling
for others
 this philosopher has a great number imitators perhaps not
less than one thousand philosophic coxcombs visit london annually and
if sir edward were to die they might all with great propriety lay claim
to a participation in the property he might leave behind him as near
relations to the family the knolls these gentlemen violate all the
moral duties life with impunity they are shameless irreligious
and so insignificant that they seem to consider themselves born for
no useful purpose whatever indeed they are such perfect blanks in the
creation that were they transported to some other place the community
would never miss them except by the diminution follies and vices
like poisonous plants they merely vegetate diffuse their contagious
effluvia around then sink into corruption and are forgotten for ever
whip me such fellows through the world exclaimed sparkle i have no
relish for them
on calling in at long's hotel they were informed that sparkle's servant
had been in pursuit his master in consequence letters having
arrived from the country and as dashall knew that he had two excellent
reasons why he should immediately acquaint himself with their contents
the party immediately returned to piccadilly
chapter xxvi
mark the change at very first vacation
she's scarcely known to father or relation
no longer now in vesture neat and tight
because forsooth she's learn'd to be polite
but crop't a bosom bare her charms explode
her shape the tout ensemble alamode 
why bet cries pa what's come to thee late
this school has turn'd thy brain as sure as fate
what means these vulgar ways i hate em wench
you shan't i tell thee imitate the french
because great yokes adopt a foreign taste
and wear their bosoms naked to the waist
d'ye think you shall no no i loathe such ways
mercy great notes shew all for nothing now days

the morning arose with smiles and sunshine which appeared almost to
invite our party earlier than they intended to the enjoyments a plan
which had occupied their attention on the previous evening when sparkle
proposed a ride which being consented to the horses were prepared and
they were quickly on the road
passing through somers town sparkle remarked to his friend dashall
that he could not help thinking that the manners and information the
rising generation ought to be greatly improved
and have you not had sufficient evidence the fact was the reply
why certainly continued sparkle if the increase public schools
round the metropolis is in proportion to what has already met my
eye during our present short ride there is sufficient evidence that
education is considered as it ought to be the first importance yet
i question whether we are so much more learned than our ancestors as
to require such a vast increase teachers nay is not the market
overstocked with these heads seminaries similar to the republic 
letters which is overwhelmed with authors and clogged with bookmakers
and books
 this remark replied tom might almost as well be made upon
every trade and profession which is followed in the present day there
are so many in each that a livelihood can scarcely be obtained and a
universal grumbling is the consequence
well said bob i can with safety say there are but two trades or
callings that i have met with since my arrival in london to which i
have discovered no rivalship
this remark from tallyhoho excited some surprise in the mind his two
friends who were anxious to know to what he alluded
i mean continued he the doll's bedstead seller who is frequently
to be heard in the street london bawling with a peculiarity 
voice as singular as the article he has for sale buy my doll's
bedsteads and the other a well known whistler whom you must both
have heard
egad you are right replied sparkle and although i recollect them
both i must confess the observation now made has never so forcibly
struck me before it however proves you have not exhausted your time
in town without paying attention to the characters it contains nor the
circumstances by which they obtain their livelihood and although
the introduction is not exactly in point with the subject previous
remarks and ought not to cut the thread our discourse it has some
reference and conveys to my mind a novel piece information but i
was about to consider what can be the causes for this extraordinary
host ladies all ages classes and colours from the honourable
mistress to the misses stubbs who have their establishment for
the education young ladies in a superior style and whether inconsequence
 this legion fair labourers in learning and science
our countrywomen for i am adverting particularly to the softer sex are
chaster wiser and better than their mammas and grandmammas
a most interesting subject truly replied tom and well worthy 
close investigation now for my part i apprehend that the increase 
tutors arises from many other causes than the more general diffusion 
knowledge
 there can be no doubt it continued sparkle and some
 those causes are odd enough very opposite to wisdom and not more
conducive to improvement for amongst them you will find pride poverty
and idleness
for instance you may discover that the proud partner a shopkeeper
in the general line or more plainly speaking the proprietor a
chandler's shop is ambitious having her daughter accomplished
e'en good geoffrey forge a blacksmith by descent
who has his life midst bars and hammers spent
resolves his bet shall learn to read and write
and grace his table with a wit polite
to make for father's sense a reparation
the day arrives for fatal separation
when betsey quits her dad with tears woe
and goes to boardingschool at publico
well the accomplishments sought are music dancing french and
ornamental work instead learning the bible being brought up to
domestic utility cooking washing plain work and the arithmetic
necessary for keeping the accounts her father's shop what is the
consequence the change in her education quite unfits miss for her
station in life makes her look down on her unlettered pa and ma as
persons too ignorant for her to associate with while she is looking
up with anxious expectation to marry a man fortune probably an
officer and is not unfrequently taken unceremoniously without the
consent her parents on a visit to the church
you are pushing the matter as close as you can charles said dashall
though i confess i think nay i may say indeed i know some instances
in which such fatal consequences have been the result the conduct to
which you allude
well then suppose even that this superior style education should
not have the effect turning the poor girl's head and that she really
has prudence and discretion enough to avoid the perils and snares 
ambition miss celestina is at least unfitted for a tradesman's wife
and she must either become a companion or a governess or a teacher
at a school or be set up as the minerva an evening school half
educated herself and exposed in every situation for which she is
conceived to be fitted to numerous temptations betwixt the teachers
 waltzes and quadrilles the one horse chaise dancingmasters the
laxmorale foreign musicmaster or the dashing pa her young pupils
perhaps a peer celibacy is not always so much an affair choice as
 circumstances and sad difficulties are consequently thrown in the
way poor miss so and so's path through life all originating from
pride
 well said bob since you have been amusing us with
this description i have counted not less than eight seminaries
establishments and preparatory schools
i do not doubt it continued sparkle and some them on the meanest
scale notwithstanding the high sounding titles under which they are
introduced to public notice others presided over by sister spinsters
not unfrequently with frenchified names such for instance as
mesdames guerdon's seminary the lady's real name being martha or
if you please patty burton and a deformed relative completing
the mesdames the misses de la porte whom nature had made simple
porter and no great catch to obtain either the misses cox's
preparatory school for young gentlemen an early age all seem
to bespeak the poverty false pride and affectation the owners
notwithstanding the fine denominations given to some these learned
institutions such as bellevue seminary montpelier house bel
retiro boarding school c c
to such artifices as these are two classes females compelled to
resort namely reduced gentlewomen and exalted tradesmen's daughters
who disdain commerce and hate the homely station which dame nature had
originally intended them to move in such ladies either by birth or
adoption prefer the twig to the distaff the study to the shop and
experience more pleasure in walking out airing with their pupils taking
their station in the front frequently gaudily and indiscreetly dressed
than to be confined to the counter or the domestic occupations the
good old english housewife former times
such ladies are frequently to be met with on all the greens and
commons from dirty stephen or retinal to the more sumptuous clapham or
wollaston some them are so occupied with self that the randomshot
glances their pupils at the exquisite and the dandy militaires about
town do not come within the range their notice while others are
more vigilant but often heave a sigh at the thought that the gay and
gallant captain should prefer the ruddy daughter a cheesemonger to
the reduced sprigs gentility which they consider themselves
 at all events many these ladies and worthy ones too are
placed par force poverty in this avocation unsuited to their
abilities their hearts their habits or their former expectations the
government their young flock is odious to them and although they may
go through the duties their situation with apparent patience it is
in fact a drudgery almost insupportable and the objects nearest the
governess's heart are the arrival the vacation the entrancemoney
the quarter's schooling and a lengthy list items the arrival 
black monday or a cessation holidays brings depressed spirits and
she returns to her occupation deploring her unlucky stars which placed
her in so laborious a situation envies her cousin sarah who has
caught a minor in her net nay even perhaps would be happy to exchange
circumstances with the thoughtless miss skipwell who has run away with
her dancingmaster or ruined a young clergyman a serious turn by
addressing loveletters to him copied from the most romantic novels
which have softened his heart into matrimony and made genteel beggars
 the reverend mistress himself and a numerous offspring
very agreeable indeed cried dashall
perhaps not said tallyhoho interrupting him to the parties
described
you mistake me was the reply i meant the combination air and
exercise with the excellent descriptions our friend sparkle who by
the way has not yet done with the subject
i am aware it continued sparkle for there is one part which i
mentioned at the outset which may with great propriety be added in the
way elucidation i mean idleness it is the third and shall for
the present be the last subject our consideration and even this has
contributed its fair proportion teachers to the world miss mel ta
way the daughter a tallowchandler who ruined himself by dressing
extravagantly his wife and over educating his dear caroline matilda
in consequence which he failed and shortly afterwards left the world
altogether was brought up in the straw line but this was no solid
trade and could not be relied upon however she plays upon the harp
and the guitar what advantages yet she also failed in the strawhat
line and therefore idleness prefers becoming an assistant teacher
and music mistress to taking to any more laborious even though more
productive mode obtaining a livelihood
 then miss nugent has a few hundred pounds the remnant 
pa's gleanings pa having been the retired butler a pigeons peer a
retail bookseller sought her hand in marriage but she thought him
quite a vulgar fellow he had no taste for waltzing at which she was
considered to excel he blamed her indulgence in such pleasures and
ventured to hint something about a pudding then again he can't speak
french and dresses in ditties now all this is really barbarous and
consequently miss nugent spurns the idea such a connection
let us trace her still further in a short time she is addressed by a
captain kirkpatrick tyrconnel who makes his approaches with a splendid
equipage the romantic sound the former and the glare the latter
attract her attention the title captain however is merely a nom
de guerre for he is only an ensign on halfpay miss is delighted with
his attentions he is a charming fellow highly accomplished for he
sings duets waltzes admirably plays the german flute and interlards
his conversation with scraps french and spanish altogether he is
truly irresistible and she is willing to lay her person and her few
hundreds at the feet the conquerer the day is appointed and every
preparation made for the nuptial ceremony when ah who can foresee
the various turns fate below
an athletic hibernian wife formerly the widow dennis o'drumball
steps in between the young lady and the hymeneal altar and claims the
captain as her husband she being the landlady a country alehouse
where he had been quartered whom he had married by way discharging
his bill the interposition is fortunate because it saves the captain
from an involuntary trip to botany bay and miss from an alliance 
a organical kind though it has at the same time proved a severe
disappointment to the young lady
crossed in love wounded in the most tender part she forswears the
hymeneal tie and under such unfortunate circumstances she opens a
seminary to which she devotes the remainder her life
 pray said bob whose eyes were as open as his ears did you
notice that shining black board with preposterous large gold letters
announcing miss smallgood's establishment for young ladies and close
alongside it another informing the passenger that mantraps were
placed in the premises
i did said sparkle but i do not think that though somewhat
curious the most remarkable or strange association young ladies
educated on an improved plan and mantraps advertised in order to
create terror and dismay for connected with this method announcing
places education is a recollection receptacles another
nature
to what do you allude inquired tallyhoho why in many instances
private madhouses are disguised as boarding schools under the
designation establishment many these receptacles in the
vicinity the metropolis are rendered subservient to the very
worst purposes though originally intended for the safety the
individual as well as the security the public against the commission
 acts which are too frequently to be deplored as the effect 
insanity all the houses mourning that to which poor unhappy
mortals are sent under mental derangement is decidedly the most gloomy
the idea strikes the imagination with horror which is considerably
increased by a reflection on the numerous human victims that are
incarcerated within their walls the discipline they are subjected
to and the usual pecuniary success which attends the keepers such
establishments where the continuance the patient is the chief
source interest rather than the recovery that they are useful
in some cases cannot be denied but there are many instances too well
authenticated to be doubted where persons desirous getting rid 
aged and infirm relatives particularly if they manifested any little
aberration mind as is common in advanced age have consigned them
to these receptacles from which through the supposed kindness 
their friends and the management the proprietors they have never
returned if the parties ail nothing they are soon driven to insanity
by ill usage association with unfortunates confined like themselves
vexation at the treatment and absolute despair escape or if
partially or slightly afflicted the lucid intervals are prevented
and the disorder by these means is increased and confirmed by coercion
irritation mind and despair
 this is a deplorable picture the state things indeed
said tallyhoho
but it is unvarnished was the reply the picture requires no
imaginary embellishment since it has its foundation in truth then
again contrast the situation the confined with the confined the
relatives have an interest in the care the person and a control over
the property which in cases death frequently becomes their own
the keepers these receptacles have also an interest in keeping the
relatives in a disposition to forward all their views retaining the
patient who under the representation being seriously deranged is
not believed consequently all is delusion but the advantages which
ultimately fall to the tenderhearted relative or the more artful
proprietor the madhouse and it is wonderful what immense fortunes
are made by the latter nay not only by the proprietors but even
the menials in their employ many whom have been known to retire
independent a circumstance which clearly proves that by some means or
other they must have possessed themselves the care the property
as well as that the persons their unfortunate victims
this is a dull subject said dashall though i confess that some
exposures which have been made fully justify your observations but i am
not fond looking at such gloomy pictures real life
true replied sparkle but it connects itself with the object you
have had in view and though i know there are many who possess souls
 sensibility and who would shrink from the contemplation so much
suffering humanity it is still desirable they should know the effects
produced almost by inconceivable causes i know people in general avoid
the contemplation as well as fly from the abodes misery contenting
themselves by sending pecuniary assistance but unfortunately there
are a number things that wear a similarity appearance yet are so
unlike in essence and reality that they are frequently mistaken by the
credulous and unwary who become dupes merely because they are not eyewitnesses
 the facts but if the subject is dull let us push forward
take a gallop over hampstead heath and return
 with all my heart cried dashall giving a spur to his horse
and away they went
the day was delightfully fine the appearance the country banished
all gloomy thoughts from their minds and after a most agreeable ride
they returned to piccadilly where finding dinner ready they spent
the remainder the evening in the utmost hilarity and the mutual
interchange amusing and interesting conversation principally
relative to sparkle's friends in the country and their arrangements for
the remainder their time during their stay in the metropolis
chapter xxvii
e'en mighty monarchs may at times unbend
and sink the dull superior in the friend
the jaded scholar his lov'd closet quits
to chat with folks below and save his wits
peeps at the world awhile with curious look
then flies again with pleasure to his 
the tradesman hastes away from care's rude gripe
to meet the neighbouring club and smoke his pipe
all this is well in decent bounds restrained
no health is injured and no mind is pain'd
but constant travels in the paths joy
yield no delights but what in time must cloy
though novelty spread all its charms to view
and men with eagerness those charms pursue
one truth is clear that by too frequent use
they early death or mis'ry may produce
 the post the following morning brought information for
dashall and his friends and no time was lost in breaking open the seals
 letters which excited the most pleasing anticipations a dead
silence prevailed for a few minutes when rising almost simultaneously
expressions satisfaction and delight were interchanged at the
intelligence received
merry well's success had proved more than commensurate with his most
sanguine expectations he had arrived at the residence his dying
relative just time enough to witness his departure from this sublunary
sphere and hear him with his expiring breath say all is thine and
a letter to each his former friends announced the pleasure and
the happiness he should experience by an early visit to his estate
declaring his determination to settle in the country and no more become
a rambler in the labyrinths london
this was a moment unexpected though hoped for gratification sparkle
applauded the plan he intended to pursue
tallyhoho confessed himself tired this world wonders and appeared
to be actuated by a similar feeling he conceived he had seen enough 
the life a rover and seemed to sigh for his native plains again
 dashall's relish for novelty in london was almost subdued and
after comparing notes together for a short time it was mutually agreed
that they would dine quietly at home and digest a plan for future
proceedings
never said tom did i feel so strong an inclination to forego
the fascinating charms a london life as at the present moment
and whether i renounce it altogether or not we will certainly pay a
congratulatory visit to merry well
example said sparkle endeavouring to encourage the feeling with
which his friend's last sentiment was expressed is at all times better
than precept and retirement to domestic felicity is preferable to
revelry in splendid scenes dissipation which generally leads to
premature dissolution
agreed said tom and happy is the man who like yourself has more
than self to think for blest with a lovely and amiable wife and an
ample fortune no man upon earth can have a better chance gliding
down the stream life surrounded by all the enjoyments it can
afford while i 
oh what a lost mutton am i
sparkle could scarcely forbear laughing at his friend though he was
unable to discover whether he was speaking seriously or ironically he
therefore determined to rally him a little
how said he why you are growing serious and sentimental all at
once what can be the cause this change opinion so suddenly
my views life replied dashall have been sufficient to convince
me that a like in london is the high road to death i have however
tried its vagaries in all companies in all quarters and as the song
says
having sown my wild oats in my youthful days i wish to live happily
now they are done
by this time sparkle was convinced that dashall was speaking the real
sentiments his mind and congratulated him upon them
 tallyhoho expressed himself highly delighted with the information
he had acquired during his stay in london but could not help at the
same time acknowledging that he had no wish to continue in the same
course much longer it was therefore agreed that on that day fortnight
they would leave the metropolis for the residence merrywell and
trust the future guidance their pursuits to chance
it would argue a want loyalty said tom if we did not witness the
royal departure for scotland before we quit town and as that is to take
place on saturday next we will attend the embarkation his majesty at
greenwich and then turn our thoughts towards a country life
sparkle was evidently gratified by this determination though he could
hardly persuade himself it was likely to be long duration and bob
inwardly rejoiced at the expression sentiments in exact accordance
with his own at a moment when they were all absorbed in thoughts 
the future they were suddenly drawn to the present by a man passing the
window bawling aloud buy a pray buy a pray
what does the fellow mean interrupted tallyhoho
mean said dashall nothing more than to sell his clothes props
props replied bob but he cries traps i suppose that is a new style
adopted in london
not at all continued sparkle the alteration sound only arises
from an habitual carelessness with which many what are termed the
london cries are given a sort tone or jargon which is acquired by
continually calling the same thing and in which you will find he is
not singular the venders milk for instance seldom call the article
they carry for sale as it is generally sounded mien or mien below 
though some have recently adopted the practice crying mien above 
the sort singsong style which the wandering venders different
goods get into as it were by nature is frequently so unintelligible
that even an old inhabitant the town and its environs can scarcely
ascertain by the ear what is meant and which i apprehend arises more
from the sameness subject than from any premeditated intention the
parties so calling other instances may be given the chimneysweeper
you will find instead bawling sweep frequently contracts
it to weep or eep the former not altogether incompatible with the
situation the shivering little being who crawls along the streets
under a load soot to the great annoyance the well dressed
passengers however it has the effect warning them his approach
the fustian above curtailment as if he felt his superiority over the
fluemaker lengthens his sound to dustho or dustwo besides he is
dignified by carrying a bell in one hand by which he almost stuns
those around him and appears determined to kick up a dust if he can
do nothing else the cries muffins in the streets it is difficult
to understand as they are in the habit ringing a tinkling bell
the sound which can scarcely be heard and calling mapping ho and
i remember one man whom i have frequently followed from whom i could
never make out more than happy happy happy now there is a man who
frequently passes through the strand wheeling a barrow before him
bawling as he moves along in a deep and sonorous voice smoaking hot
piping hot hot chelsea buns and another in the vicinity covent
garden who attracts considerable notice by the cry come buy my live
shrimps and pierriwinkles buy my wink wink wink these however are
exceptions to those previously mentioned as they have good voices
and deliver themselves to some tune but to the former may be added
the itinerant collector old clothes who continually annoys you
with chow chow sale the ingenious ned shute the most luxuriant
comedian his time frequently entertained his audience on his benefit
nights with admirable imitations the cries london in which he
introduced a remarkable little man who sold puffs and who from the
peculiar manner his calling them acquired the name golly molly
puff by this singularity he became a noted character and at almost
every period some such peculiar itinerant has become remarkable in the
streets london some years back a poor wretched being who dealt in
shreds and patches used to walk about inviting people by the following
lines
linen woollen and leather
bring em out altogether
 another a sleekheaded whimsical old man appeared who was
commonly called the wooden poet from his carrying wooden ware which
was slung in a basket round his neck and who chaunted a kind song in
doggerel rhyme somewhat similar to the following
come come my worthy soul
will you buy a wooden bowl
i am just come from the borough
will you buy a pudding stirrer
i hope i am not too soon
for you to buy a wooden spoon
i've come quick as i was able
thinking you might want a ladle
and if i'm not too late
buy a trencher or wood plate
or if not it's no great matter
so you take a wooden platter
it may help us both to dinner
if you'll buy a wooden skimmer
come neighbours don't be shy for i deal just and fair
come quickly come and buy all sorts wooden ware
very well indeed for a wooden poet exclaimed bois he certainly
deserved custom at all events his rivals walter scott or lord byron
would have turned such a poetical effusion to some account it would
have been dramatized murray hangman c would have been all in a
bustle puffing blowing and advertising we should have had piracies
chancery injunctions and the d to pay but alas it makes all
the difference whether a poet is fashionable and popular or not
 lord byron in his to a recent publication
complains that among other black arts resorted to for the
purpose injuring his fair fame he has been accused 
receiving considerable sums for writing poetical puffs for
warren's blacking we can safely acquit his lordship this
charge as well as plagiarism from the poems he alludes
to but it has led to a curious rencontre between the
blackinglaureat and his patron the vender the shinking
jet and after considerable blackguardian between the
parties the matter is likely to become the subject legal
discussion among the gentlemen the black robe
the poet it appears received half a crown for each
production from the man blacking which the latter
considered not only a fair but even liberal remuneration
for poetic talent not overlookking that while the
pecuniary reward would produce comfort and add a polish to
personal appearance the brilliance the composition
both poetry and blacking would be fairly divided
between he authors each and that the fame both would
be conjointly
handed down to posterity and shine for ever in the temple
 fame
now it requires no uncommon sagacity to perceive that but
for this unfortunate mistake the public the poet would
have remained satisfied as far as pecuniary recompence
went with the halfcrown looking to futurity for that
more complete recompence which poets ever consider far
beyond pudding or sensual gratification fame and
immortality but alas
from causes quite obscure and unforeseen what great events
to man may sometimes spring
finding from lord bs own statement that the public had
duly appreciated the merit these compositions and had
attached so high a value as even to mistake them for his
lordship's productions our bard was naturally led into a
train reasoning and logical deductions as to what
advantage had and what ought to have resulted to himself
according to this estimate by public opinion lord b and
his great northern contemporary it appeared received
thousands from the public for their poems while halfcrowns
not to be despised during certain cravings but soon
dissipated by that insatiable and unceasing tormentor the
stomach was all the benefit likely to accrue in this world
to the original proprietor in a happy moment a happy
thought flitted athwart the poet's mind and like the china
seller in the arabian nights he found himself rolling in
ideal wealth and spurning with disdain the blacking
merchant the blacking and the halfcrowns he resolved on
a project by which to realize his fondest wishes wealth
happiness and independence
the project was this to collect together the fugitive
blacking sonnets so as to form a volume under the title 
poems supposed to be written by lord byron and offer the
copyright to mr murray and in case his refusing a
liberal sum that is something approaching to what he
pays the noble bard per vol to publish them on his the
author's own account and depend on the public for that
support and encouragement which their favourable decision
had already rendered pretty certain
now then comes the rub the blacking vender hearing 
our poet's intention files a bill in chancery praying for
an injunction to restrain the publication and claiming an
exclusive right in the literary property the poet in
replication denies having assigned or transferred the
copyright and thus issue is joined his lordship with his
usual extreme caution where important rights are involved
wished to give the matter mature consideration and said
he would take the papers home to peruse more attentively
it will be recollected that in the cause respecting lord
byron's poem cain his lordship stated that during the
vacation he had by way relaxation from business perused
that work and paradise lost in order to form a just
estimate their comparative merits and who knows but
during the present vacation his lordship may compare the
blacking sonnets with child harold fare thee well
c and that on next seal day the public may be benefited
by his opinion as to which is entitled to the claim 
superior excellence and how far the public are justified in
attributing the former to the noble author the latter
 then continued sparkle there was a rustic usually mounted
on a white hobby with a basket on one arm who used to invade the
northern purlieus london mumbling holloway cheesecakes which from
his mode utterance sounded like ho all my teeth ake
ha ha ha vociferated tallyhoho unable to restrain his risibility
numerous other instances might be adduced continued sparkle among
many there was a noted pitman whose pigs were made what is called
standing crust three or four inches long baked with currant sauce in
the belly who used to cry or rather sing
a long tail'd pig or a short tail'd pig c
there was another singular character who used to be called teddydoll
a noted vender gingerbread at bartholomew southwark and other
fairs who to collect customers round his basket used to chaunt a song
in which scarcely any thing was distinctly articulated but the cant
expression teddydoll he used to wear a high cocked hat and feather
with broad scolloped gold lace on it and last though not least was
sir jeffrey dunstan garret fame who used to walk about the streets
in a blue coat with gold lace his shirt bosom open and without a hat
accompanied by his daughter miss nancy crying ould wigs
old wigs reverberated bob an extraordinary article merchandize
not more extraordinary than true replied dashall but come i
suppose we shall all feel inclined to write a few lines to the country
so let us make the best our time
upon this signal each flew to the exercise the quill and indulged
his own vein thought in writing to his friend and the day closed
upon them without any further occurrence deserving particular remark
chapter xxviii
haste away to scotland dear
and leave your native home
the land cakes affords good cheer
and you've a mind to roam
here splendid sights and gala nights
are all prepar'd for thee
while lords and knights amid gay delights
and ladies bend the knee
haste away to scotia's land
with kilt and highland plaid
and join the sportive reeling band
with ilia bonny lad
for night and day we'll trip away
with cheerful dance and glee
come o'er the spray without delay
each joy's prepared for thee

the morning arose with a smiling and inviting aspect and as it had been
previously rumoured that his majesty would embark from greenwich
hospital at halfpast eight o'clock on his intended voyage to scotland
our party had arranged every thing for their departure at an early hour
and before seven o'clock had seated themselves in a commodious and
elegant barge moored off westminster bridge intending if possible to
see the city companies headed by the lord mayor and court aldermen
start as had been proposed from the tower they were shortly
afterwards gliding on the surface the watery element towards the
scene action by this time the numerous parties in pursuit the
same object were on the alert and from almost every part the shore
as they passed along gaily dressed company was embarking while merry
peals bells seemed to announce approaching delight the steeples on
shore and the vessels in the river exhibited flags and streamers
which gave an additional splendour to the scene all was anxiety and
expectation numerous barges and pleasureboats laden with elegant
company were speeding the same way and every moment increasing so
that the whole view displayed a combination beauty fashion and
loyalty not often surpassed
 on arriving off the tower it was soon ascertained that
the lord mayor and city companies had got the start them and
consequently they proceeded on their journey not doubting but they
should overtake them before reaching greenwich and in this expectation
they were not disappointed for soon after passing rotherhithe church
they came up with the city state barge which was towed by a steamboat
accompanied by several other state barges the whole filled with
company the brightness the morning and the superb appearance 
these gaily manned and it might be added gaily woman gallies fora
numerous party fashionably attired ladies added their embellishing
presence to the spectacle formed altogether a picture more than
ordinary interest and magnificence
this royal visit to scotland said sparkle has for some time past
been a prevailing topic discussion from one the land cakes
to the other and the preparations for his majesty's reception are 
the most splendid description triumphal arches are to be erected new
roads to be made banquets to be given general illuminations to take
place body guards royal archers to be appointed and the dull light
 oil lamps to be totally obscured by the full blaze royal gas then
there are to be meetings the civil and municipal authorities from
every town and county presenting loyal and dutiful addresses and it is
expected that there will be so much booing among the carle's when the
king's come that the oilier are said to be not a whit disconcerted at
the introduction gas lights the unctuous article being at present
in great demand for the purpose suppling the stiff joints the
wouldbe courtiers who have resolved to give a characteristic specimen
 their humble loyalty and to oulboo all the hoping the famed sir
pertinax
however observed dashall it is not very likely they will be able to
equal the grace with which it is acknowledged the king can bow and he
is to be accompanied by the accomplished sir billy city notoriety
so that admirable examples are certain being presented to the
scottish gentry reports state that the worthy baronet who
is considered to be great weight wherever he goes is determined
to afford his majesty in this visit to edinburgh the benefit that
preponderating loyalty which he last year threw into the scale the
dublin corporation and that he has recently purchased from a highland
tailor in the hay market a complete suit tartan philebeg c with
which he means to invest himself as the appropriate costume to meet
his royal master on his arrival at edinburgh
in that case said sparkle there is one circumstance greatly to be
regretted considering the gratification which our northern neighbours
might have derived from ascertaining the precise number cats the
most weighty london citizens i remember reading a day or two back
that the weighhouse the city edinburgh was disposed by public
roup and that a number workmen were immediately employed to take it
down as the whole must be cleared away by the th august under a
penalty l what a pity that in the annals the weighhouse the
scotch could not have registered the actual weight the greatest 
london aldermen
tom and bob laughed heartily at their friend sparkle's anticipations
respecting the worthy baronet while bob dryly remarked he should
think sir willie would prove himself a bonnie lad among the lasses o
and nae doubt he would cut a braw figure in his highland suit
but continued dashall we are indulging in visions fancy without
paying that attention to the scene around us which it deserves and i
perceive we are approaching greenwich hospital there is the royal yacht
ready prepared for the occasion the shores are already crowded with
company and the boats and barges are contending for eligible situations
to view the embarkation there is the floating chapel and a little
further on to the right is the marine society's schoolship for the
education young lads for his majesty's service the hospital now
presents a grand and interesting appearance what say you suppose we
land at the three crowns and make inquiry as to the likely time his
majesty's departure
with all my heart replied sparkle and we can then refresh for i am
not exactly used to water excursions and particularly so early in the
morning consequently it has a good effect on the appetite
 by this time the city barges had taken positions in the front
 the hospital and our party passed them to gain the proposed place
 inquiry here however all was conjecture the people greenwich
hospital appeared to know as little the time appointed as those 
the metropolis and finding they had little chance accommodation inconsequence
 the great influx company they again embarked
and shortly after attacked the produce their locker and with an
excellent tongue and a glass madeira regaled themselves sufficiently
to wait the arrival time however hung heavily on their hands though
they had a view thousands much worse situated than themselves
and could only contemplate the scene with astonishment that serious
mischiefs did not accrue from the immense congregated multitude by
which they were surrounded
anxiety and anticipation were almost exhausted and had nearly given
place to despondency when about three o'clock the extraordinary bustle
on shore announced the certainty the expected event being about to
take place and in about half an hour after they were gratified by
seeing his majesty descend the steps the hospital attended by the
noblemen c under a royal salute and rowed to the vessel prepared to
receive him the royal standard was immediately hoisted and away sailed
the king amidst the heartfelt congratulations and good wishes his
affectionate and loyal people the firing cannon the ringing 
bells and every other demonstration a lively interest in his safety
and welfare leaving many to conjecture the feelings with which the
heart must be impressed a person so honoured and attended we shall
select a few descriptive lines from the pen a literary gentleman
in his opinion the most likely to be expressive the sentiments
entertained on the occasion
royal recollections
as slow the yacht her northern track
against the wind was cleaving
her noble master oft look'd back
to that dear spot twas leaving
so loth to part from her he loves
from those fair charms that bind him
he turns his eye where'er he roves
to her he's left behind him
when round the bowl other dears
he talks with joyous seeming
his smiles resemble vapourish tears
so faint so sad their beaming
while memory brings him back again
each early tie that twin'd him
how sweet's the cup that circles then
to her he's left behind him
ah should our noble master meet
some highland lass enchanting
with looks all buxom wild and sweet
yet love would still be wanting
he'd think how great had been his bliss
if heav'n had but assign'd him
to live and die so pure as this
with her he's left behind him
as travelers oft look back at eve
when eastward darkly going
to gaze upon that light they leave
still faint behind them glowing
so ere he's been a month away
at home we sure shall find him
for he can never longer stay
from her he's left behind him
the gay assemblage before them and the ceremony the embarkation the
sound music and the shouts the populace and animated appearance
 the river which by this time seemed all in motion amply repaid our
friends for the time they had waited and after watching the departure
 the royal squadron they returned to town and as they passed the
london docks it occurred to the mind the hon tom dashall that his
cousin had not yet paid a visit to these highly interesting productions
 human genius and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to their
inspection before his departure from the metropolis
chapter xxix
where has commerce such a mart
so rich so throng'd so drained and so supplied
as london opulent enlarged and still
increasing london babylon old
not more the glory the earth than she
a more accomplish'd world's chief glory now

according to arrangements previously made our friends met in the
morning with a determination to shape their course eastward in order to
take a survey the commercial docks for the accommodation shipping
and the furtherance trade and the carriage being ordered they were
quickly on their way towards blackwell
the docks the port london said the hon tom dashall are 
the highest importance in a commercial point view and are among the
prominent curiosities british commerce as they greatly facilitate
trade and afford additional security to the merchants
yes said sparkle and it is to be presumed no small profit to the
shareholders the companies by which they were established but i
expect your cousin will derive more gratification from a sight the
places themselves than from any description we can give and the
time to explain will be when we arrive on the spot for it is scarcely
possible for any one to conceive the immensity buildings they
contain or the regularity with which the business is carried on how
do ye do thrusting his head out the window and moving his hand
with graceful familiarity i have not seen sir frederick since my
matrimonial trip and now he has passed by on horseback i really believe
without seeing me dashall you remember sir frederick forfeit
perfectly well replied tom but i was paying so much attention to
you that i did not notice him the liveliest fellow except yourself
in the whole round my acquaintance
 and you are one the best i ever met with to gain a point by
a good turn but take it and make the most you can it i may have an
opportunity paying you off in your own coin
tallyhoho laughed heartily at the manner in which sparkle had altogether
changed the conversation but could not help remarking that sir
frederick had not given a specimen his politeness by avoiding a
return sparkle's salutation
and yet continued sparkle he is one the most polished men i
know notwithstanding i think his upper story is not a bit too well
furnished he has a handsome fortune and a pretty wife who would
indeed be a lovely woman but for an affectation manners which she
assumed upon coming to the title lady forfeit their parties are 
the most dashing order and all the rank and fashion the metropolis
visit their mansion
sparkle who was in his usual humour for conversation and description
now entertained his friends with the following account a party with
whom he had spent an evening just previous to his departure from town
mrs stepswift is the widow lady a dancingmaster who having
acquired some little property previous to his decease left his partner
in possession his wealth and two daughters though the provision for
their education and support was but scanty the mother had the good luck
a few years after to add to her stock ten thousand pounds by a prize in
the lottery a circumstance which afforded her additional opportunities
 indulging her passion for dress which she did not fail to inculcate
in her daughters who though not handsome were rather pleasing and
agreeable girls and since the good fortune to which i have alluded she
has usually given a ball by way introduction to company and with the
probable view as they are now marriageable to secure them husbands
it was on one these occasions that i was invited and as i knew
but one the party i had an excellent opportunity making my
uninterrupted remarks
then said dashall i'll wager my life you acted the part an
observant quiz
and i should think you would be likely to win observed tallyhoho
 i am bound to consider myself obliged continued sparkle
for the bold construction you are kind enough to put upon my character
and conduct by your observations but never mind i am not to be
intimidated by the firing a popgun or a flash in the pan therefore
i shall proceed upon my introduction i found the widow playing a rubber
with a punchy parson a lean doctor and a halfpay officer in the
guards and consequently taking a friend i knew by the arm i strolled
through the rooms which were spacious and well furnished in the
ballroom i found numerous couples tripping it on the light fantastic
toe to the tune i'll gang no more to yon town and displaying
a very considerable portion grace and agility in the other room
devoted to refreshments and cards i met with several strollers like
myself who being without partners or not choosing to dance with such
as they could obtain were lounging away their time near the centre 
the room i was introduced to the two young ladies who behaved with the
utmost politeness and attention though i could easily perceive there
was a considerable portion affectation mingled with their manners
and i soon discovered that they operated as the loadstone attraction
to several dandylike beaux who were continually flocking around them
my dear miss eliza said a pugnosed dandy whom i afterwards
understood to be a jeweller's showman may i be allowed the superlative
honor and happiness attending you down the next dance the manner in
which this was spoken with a drawling lisp and the unmeaning attitude
 the speaker which was any thing but natural provoked my risibility
almost beyond forbearance his bushy head the fall his cape and the
awkward stickout his coat which was buttoned tight round his waist
the drop his quizzing glass from his bosom and the opera hat in his
hand formed altogether as curious a figure as i ever recollect to have
seen though my eyes were immediately directed to another almost as
grotesque by the young lady herself who informed the applicant that
she had engaged herself with captain scrambled and could not avail
herself his intended honor while the captain himself with a mincing
gait little compatible with the line life to which it was to be
presumed he was attached was advancing and eyeing the wouldbe rival
with all the apparent accuracy a mil
having satisfied themselves by looking over these extensive works mr
m informed them that adjoining the docks was a shipbuilding yard
formerly well known as perry's yard but now the property sir robert
wigwam probably you would like to take a view round it
to this having replied in the affirmative they were quickly introduced
sir robert said mr m has been and i believe still is a
considerable managing owner east india shipping whose fortune
appears to have advanced as his family increased and perhaps few men
have deserved better success he was born at wexford in ireland in the
year and was brought up under his father to the profession 
a surgeon he left ireland early in life to pursue his studies in
england and afterwards obtained an appointment as surgeon an east
indiamen and remained some years in the service he married miss
broadhurst the youngest daughter francis broadhurst mansfield
in nottinghamshire an eminent tanner and maltster soon after which
he commenced his career as owner east india shipping the general
goddard commanded by william taylor money esq sailed under his
management and was fortunate enough during the voyage to capture eight
dutch east indiamen considerable value off st helena since which
he has been one the most eminent shipowners in the city london
 a proof said sparkle the advantages to be derived from
perseverance and the active exercise an intelligent mind
his first wife continued the informant died in the year 
leaving him five children and in the following year he married miss
eleanor watts daughter john watts esq southampton many years
secretary to the victualling office who is the present lady wigwam
the benevolence whose heart and gentleness manners have not only
endeared her to her husband but gained her the esteem and regard all
who know her and by this lady he has had seventeen children
zounds said bob a man ought to have a mine wealth to support
such a numerous progeny
they are however all them well provided for and sir robert has
the happiness at an advanced age to find himself the father a
happy family he rejoices once a year to have them all seated at his
own table and has in many instances surprised his friends by an
introduction it is related that a gentleman from the isle wight
met him near the exchange and after mutual salutations were passed he
invited the gentleman to dine with him by whom an excuse was offered
as he was not equipped for appearing at his table nonsense said sir
robert you must dine with me and i can assure you there will be
only my own family present so come along guess the surprise his
visitor on being introduced to a large party ladies and gentlemen
he was confused and embarrassed he begged pardon and would have
retired declaring that sir robert had informed him that none but his
own family were to be present this sir r affirmed he had strictly
adhered to and introduced his friend to his sons and daughters by name
which it may fairly be presumed though it explained did not exactly
tend to decrease his visitor's embarrassment
and these premises inquired bob belong to the man you have
described
the same said mr m they are managed and conducted under the
superintendence two his sons here east india ships are built
launched and repaired there are two on the stocks now considerable
magnitude the premises are extensive and commodious and that high
building which you see is a masthouse and the other buildings about
the yard are devoted to sail lofts and shops for the various artizans
requisite to complete the grand design building and fitting
out a ship for sea from this yard you have a fine view over the marshes
towards woolwich and also a commanding prospect greenwich hospital
the various vessels and boats passing and repassing at all times give
variety to the scene before you and when a launch takes place the
whole neighbourhood represents something the nature a carnival
the river is covered with boats filled with company and every part 
the shore near the spot from which the magnificent piece mechanism is
to burst upon its native element is equally occupied temporary
booths are erected upon each side what is termed the cradle for the
accommodation invited visitors bands play as she moves and a bottle
 wine is thrown at her head as she glides from the stocks when her
name is pronounced amidst the universal shouts huzza
it must be a most gratifying sight observed bob to see her cleave
the watery world indeed it is a very pleasing view we have already
had these floating castles though i must also remark that your
descriptions have added greatly to the enjoyment and i think we are
much indebted for your kindness
they now parted with mr m and after refreshing with a glass wine
and a sandwich at the plough they proceeded to the west india docks
the entrance to which required no introduction here said dashall
you will find a much longer space occupied than at the east india
docks these were undertaken according to an act parliament passed
in and the place was formerly called the isle dogs though it
might almost as appropriately have been called the isle boys upon
the wharfs and quays adjoining all west india ships unload and load
their cargoes
and exclusively i suppose interrogated tallyhoho for the
accommodation west india shipping
exactly so continued tom the west india trade generally arrives in
fleets and formerly used to create much crowding confusion and damage
in the river but these ships being now disposed in the docks the
overgrown trade the port is carried on with pleasure and convenience
for notwithstanding they have occasioned a very important trade to
be removed to a considerable and even inconvenient distance from the
metropolis yet the advantages to the port london are upon the whole
incalculable
 the northern dock for unloading inwards is by 
feet and feet deep covering a space acres and capable
 containing from two to three hundred sail vessels in greater
security than the river could afford them and the west india dock
company are reimbursed for the accommodation by a tonnage s upon
the burthen every ship which enters the docks besides which they are
entitled to charge for wharfage landing housing weighing cooperage
and warehouse room certain rates upon all goods that are discharged
such as d per cwt upon sugar d per gallon upon rum is d per
cwt upon coffee s d per cwt upon cotton wool c and all this
immense business is conducted with a general order and regularity which
greatly facilitates the business the merchant
but said sparkle i apprehend it subjects him to something more 
expense than he incurred by the former mode proceeding
i am not able decidedly to answer continued tom but in the main i
expect that if so it is well worth what is paid to have the additional
security the forms conducting the business may sometimes be attended
with considerable trouble but there are persons so well acquainted with
them by habitual practice that there cannot be much difficulty at this
period this is the export dock which covers an area acres and
is by feet and deep the immense buildings round the two
docks are warehouses for the reception goods and are the most
substantial description and to enable shipping in their passage up and
down the thames to avoid the circuitous and inconvenient course round
the isle dogs a canal has been cut across this peninsula through
which upon paying certain moderate rates all ships vessels and
craft are permitted to pass in their passage up and down the river
in seeing this and tient date having been
made use even by the romans and not many years back a bush ivy
or a bunch grapes was used for the purpose nay to the present day
they may be met with in many places the bush is perhaps one the
most ancient publichouse signs which gave rise to the wellknown
proverb
good wine needs no bush
that is to say it requires nothing to point out where it is sold
at country fairs you will frequently see the houses in its vicinity
decorated with a bush or a bough from which they are termed bough
houses where accommodation may be found this practice i know is
still in use at boroughbridge in yorkshire during their annual fair in
june which lasts a week or ten days but putting up boughs as a sign 
any thing to be sold was not confined to alehouses for in old times
such as sold horses were wont to put flowers or boughs upon their heads
to reveal that they were vendible
 in all probability from this practice originated the well
known proverb
as fine as a horse
an illustration which from the life mrs
wilmington is here subjoined
they took places in the waggon for chester and quitted
london early on may morning and it being the custom on the
first this month to give the waggoner at every inn a
ribbon to adorn his team she soon discovered the origin 
the proverb as fine as a horse for before they got to
the the journey the poor beasts were almost blinded
by the tawdry partycoloured flowing honours their
heads
 in scotland a wisp straw upon a pole is or was some years
ago the indication an alehouse and to this day a ship or vessel for
sale may be discovered by a birch broom at the mast head i remember
reading that in fleet market on the eastern side there were some
small houses with a sign post representing two hands conjoined with
words marriages performed within written beneath them whilst a dirty
fellow assailed the ears the passengers with the reiterated and loud
address sir will you walk in and be married as if the dread 
any stoppage in the trade conjugality was threatening mankind with
premature extinction and the parson was seen walking before his shop
ready to couple you for a dram gin or a roll tobacco
those were the times for getting married exclaimed bob no
affidavits certificates and exposures at church doors
no continued sparkle those are signs altered times a witty
wigmaker adopted the sign absalom hanging to a tree with king david
lamenting at a distance who was represented with a label issuing from
his mouth containing these words
o absalom my son my son
had'st thou a peruke worn thou had'st not been undone
this sign if i remember right was to be seen a few years since in
unionstreet borough and is not uncommon even now in france where you
may also find the cochon sans tete the pig without a head which is
generally a restaurateur's sign indicating that good pork is here the
useless animal's head is off illustrative the negro's opinion 
a pig in england de pig said mungo is de only gentleman in
england man workee woman workee horse workee ass workee ox workee
and dog worked pig do nothing but eat and sleep pig therefore de only
gentleman in england
 the conversation increased in interest as they proceeded and
tallyhoho was all attention for it must be observed that as his inquiry
had occasioned it he was willing to listen to all that could be
advanced on the subject and the hon tom dashall determined to have his
share in the explanation
the man in the moon said he is derived from the old observation
that a tipsy person is in the wind or in the moon a lunatic the
sign may therefore be thought to give this advice here is good drink
gentlemen walk in and taste it it will make you as happy as the man in
the moon that is to say steep your senses in forgetfulness the
bag nails was the sign an inn at chelsea which may perhaps
be noticed as the ne plus ultra ludicrous corruption having
originally been a group bacchanals 
here risibility could no longer be restrained and a general laugh
ensued
a group bacchanals however continued tom is certainly not an
out the way sign for an inn nor do i conceive its corruption so
very outre when we look at others that have suffered much stranger
metamorphoses for who would have thought that time could have performed
such wonderful changes as to have transformed a view cologne harbour
into a black bull and a tremendous mouth sufficiently large to
swallow its neighbours horns and all or the name la belle sauvage or
beautiful savage into a bell and a gigantic wild man the woods
then again said sparkle taking up the subject the pole and bason
though no longer the exhibited emblems a barber's occupation in
london are still very often to be met with in its environs and in the
country where they are ostentatiously protruded from the front 
the house and denote that one those facetious and intelligent
individuals who will crop your head or mow your beard dwelleth here
like all other signs that the barber is remote antiquity and has
been the subject many learned conjectures some have conceived it
to originate from the word poll or head but the true intention 
the partycoloured staff was to indicate that the master the shop
practised surgery and could breathe a vein as well as shave a beard
such a staff being to this day used by practitioners and put into the
hand the patient while undergoing the operation phlebotomy the
white band which no doubt you have observed encompassing the staff was
meant to represent the fillet thus elegantly twined about it
 and this said sparkle appears to be the most reasonable
conjecture any i ever heard as it is well known the two businesses
were in former times incorporated together and the practiser was termed
a barber surgeon then as to their utility the choice a
witty device or splendid enluminure was formerly thought great
consequence to a young beginner in the world and i remember reading 
an innkeeper at cassel who having considerably profited by his numerous
customers under the sign the grey ass supposing himself well
established in his trade and his house began to be tired the vulgar
sign over his door and availed himself the arrival the landgrave
 hesse to make as he thought a very advantageous change in an
evil hour therefore the grey ass was taken down and thrown aside
in order to give place to a well painted and faithful likeness the
prince which was substituted for it as a most loyal sign
a small and almost unfrequented house in the same town immediately
took up the discarded sign and speculatively hoisted the grey ass
what was the consequence old codgers married men with scolding vives
at home straggling young fellows and all the fraternity free
topers resorted to the house filled the taproom crammed the
parlour and assailed the bar the grey ass had the run and was all
the vogue whilst the venerable prince hesse swung mournfully
and deserted at the other place and enticed no visitors foreign
or domestic for it should be observed that the grey ass had such
reputation all over germany that every foreign nobleman or gentleman
who came to cassel was sure to order his coach or chaise to be driven
to the inn that name and this order course was still continued
for how was it to be known by travellers coming from vienna hungary or
bohemia that a certain innkeeper at cassel had altered his sign to the
inn therefore which was denominated the grey ass they still went
what could the poor deserted innkeeper do in such a case to deface he
stage very indifferent actors in society and large characters in the
playbills as well as loud thunders from the gods may be earned by
very stupid very vulgar and very illbred companions the same maybe
said poets we are poor creatures at best and the giant 
a reviewer very often cuts but a very sorry figure when left to the
rickety stilts his own unsupported judgment in a drawingroom you
are tolerably familiar with our political parties but you are yet to
be acquainted with our literary squads which are the most bigotted
selfish exclusive arrogant little knots little people it is
possible to conceive
by the time that colonel a had ended his short initiation into
these various arcana the company broke up the doctor to give a lecture
on eggshells at the committee taste lord flute to visit the opera
lord skimcream to the green boom lord flash to fives court to see a
setto by candlelight the exquisite to bouge et noir or almack's
and lord wetherwool to vote on an agricultural question without
understanding a syllable its merits
nevertheless i soliloquized as i rode home his lordship will
be surprised and gratified i dare say to find himself a perfect
demosthenes in the newspaper reports tomorrow morning hems coughs
stammering blowing the nose and tenminute lapses memory
all vanish in passing through the sieves and bolters a report what
magicians the reporters are what talents what powers language they
profusely and gratuitously bestow somnus protect me from hearing any
but some half dozen orators in both houses the reader who peruses the
report has only the flour the orator's efforts provided for him
but lord help the unfortunate patient in the gallery who hopeless
 getting through the dense mass which occupy the seats round him is
condemned to sit with an aching head and be well nigh choaked with
the husks and the bran
 our party felt so much amused by these lively and
characteristic pictures real life among the corinthians the
metropolis that all thoughts seeking amusement out doors appeared
for the present relinquished and sparkle to keep the subject alive
resumed as follows
in order to give some shade and variety to this sketch society
in the west we will now if agreeable travel eastward as far as the
entrance to the city where i will introduce you in fancy to what must
at least to our friend tallyhoho afford both novelty and surprise
some time ago and before i was quite so well versed in the knowledge
 life in london as at present through the medium one the young
men genius about town i became a member a new philosophical
society called the socraticss held at a certain house near temple bar
having been plucked by several kind friends till i resembled the man
 diogenes i concluded that here at least my pockets might be
tolerably safe from the diving a friendly hand philosophers i was
told by my friend the introducer had souls above money their thoughts
were too sublime and contemplative for such worldlyminded concerns
i should have a great deal instruction for little or nothing i had
only to pay my two guineas per annum and the business was done the
gate science was open and nothing farther was requisite than to push
forward and imitate socrates but how strangely do our anticipations
mislead our sober judgments
jove breaks the tallest stilts human trust
and levels those who use them with the dust
the proprietor the institution was rather courtierlike in
making promises which the managers course considered as much too
commonplace and mechanical to be kept it professed to exclude politics
and religion from the touch its scientific paws in other words from
its discussions but alas
it kept the word promise to the ear
and broke it to the hope
 the only subjects which it did not exclude were politics
and religion neither could it be said that either these subjects
received more benefit from the way in which they were handled thana
white dress would from the handling a chimneysweeper the first
being made as black as possible in the form tompaynim and the
latter served up in the improved shape harley's or atheism under
such instruction it was scarcely possible but that i should in process
 time become qualified not only for a philosopher but a legislator
 the first water and i had serious thoughts offering my services
for the purpose drawing up a code laws to the otaheitans or the
kalmuck if i had gone on improving as i did i might perhaps have
carried out to some blackwood settlement or atlantic island as pretty a
utopian prescription under the designation a constitution as could
well be desired in the most philosophical community but one those
sad trifles which suffocate great ideas and sometimes terminate in
suffocating philosophers put a stop to my further enlightenment for the
present by drying up the treasury the socraticss the philosophers
were the most civil as well as the most unfortunate people in the world
one or other them was always in want money either to perfect
some great scheme or to save him from the unscientific handling a
bailiff it was enough to move a milestone to think how the progress
 improvement or march mind as it is called might be delayed by
being too coldhearted and it did move my purse to such a degree that
at length i had the satisfaction discerning truth sitting sola at
the bottom it my pocket consumption however was not instant but
progressive it might be called a slow fever some the philosophers
visited me for a loan like a monthly epidemic others drained me like
a tertian and one or two came upon me like an intermittent ague
every other day among these was mr maxwell the editor as he called
himself a magazine this fellow had tried a number schemes in
the literary line though none had hitherto answered but he had the
advantage and credit shewing in his own person the high repute in
which literature is held in london for he could seldom walk the streets
without having two followers at his heels one whom frequently tapped
him on the shoulder no doubt to remind him mortality like the
slave in the roman triumphs the favourite thesis this
gentleman was the march mind and on this subject he would spout
his half hour in so effectual a manner as to produce two very opposite
effects viz the closing the eyes the elder philosophers and
the opening mine which latter operation was usually rendered more
effectual by his concluding inquiry have you such a thing as a pound
note about you
to match this saint there was another
as busy and perverse a brother
this was the treasurer the socraticss thomas carney little esq
and a treasure a treasurer he was this gentleman was a pupil 
aesculapius and united in his own person the various departments 
dentist apothecary and surgeon it is presumed that he found the
employment drawing the eye teeth philosophical tyros more
profitable and bleeding the young socraticss more advantageous than
physicking his patients in his lectures he advocated the system 
research and admired deduction and this i among many others had
reason at last to know it was very odd but so it was that some two
or three hundred per annum subscribed by the members the society
vanished into the worthy treasurer's pocket as it were a moskoestron
and then disappeared for ever
another the socraticss was called epictetus moonshine esquire this
gentleman was a tall spiderlike man with lantern jaws hatchet face
and a mouth the chief characteristic which was that it made a
diagonal line from the bottom the face to the eyebrow he was a
great speculator and had taken it into his head that beyond the
blue mountains in new south wales was the real el dorado but as he
possessed according to the usual phrase more wit than money and no
one will discount a check from the aforesaid wit on change the zeal
 epictetus moonshine some time after the breaking up the socratic
institution for benefitting the human race so much got the better 
selflove that he committed several petty larcenies in hopes being
transported thither but whether his courage or his luck failed him
certain it is that he never reached the proper degree criminality
and only succeeded in visiting by turns the various penitentiaries in
london and its vicinity
 you mistake greatly sir said he to one the visiting
governors bridewell who condoled with a man his talents in such a
position if you think a residence in this sequestered haunt a subject
 regret the mind as milton says is its own seat and able itself
to make
a heaven hell a hell heaven
and now i am on the subject stoicism permit me to shew you a picture
which i have just chalked out wherein i prove that there is no such
thing as pain in the world that all which we now feel is imagination
that the idea body is deception i have had it printed written in
fourteen languages and presented to all the sovereigns europe with
a new code laws annexed to it i'll bring it in a minute if you'll
excuse me so saying the pupil zero disappeared wrapping his
blanket round him but other speculations matters high no doubt
attracted him from the remembrance his promise just as he forgot to
pay some score pounds he borrowed me for the visitor saw no more 
him
the mention el dorado brings to my recollection another member mr
goosequill who came to town with halfacrown in his pocket and his
tragedy called the mines peru by which he course expected to
make his fortune for five years he danced attendance on the manager
in order to hear tidings its being cast and four more in trying to
get it back again during the process he was groaned laughed whistled
and nearly kicked out the secretary's room who swore which he well
might do considering the exhausted treasury the concern that he
knew nothing about nor ever heard the mines peru at last mr
goosequill being shewn into the manager's kitchen to wait till he was
at leisure had the singular pleasure seeing two acts the mines
 peru daintily fastened round a savory capon on the spit to
preserve it from the scorching influence the fire
this was foul treatment i observed as he concluded his tale and i
ventured to ask how he had subsisted in the meanwhile why said he
i first made an agreement with a printer ballads in seven dials
who finding my inclinations led to poetry expressed his satisfaction
telling me that one his poets had lost his senses and was confined
in bedlam and another was become dozed with drinking drams
an agreement was made continued he and i think i earned fivepence
halfpenny per week as my share this speculation with the muses
but as my profits were not always certain i had often the pleasure 
supping with duke humphrey and for this reason i turned my thoughts to
prose and in this walk i was eminently successful for during a week 
gloomy weather i published an apparition on the substance which i
subsisted very comfortably for a month i have often made a good meal
upon a monster a rape has frequently afforded me great satisfaction
but a murder welltimed was a neverfailing resource
but to return to the catastrophe the socraticss by the time that
the philosophical experiments in diving without hydraulics had cleaned
me entirely out it was suggested that any thing in the shape a loan
would be desirable they were not nice not they a pair globes a
set catoptric instruments an electrical apparatus a few antique
busts or a collection books for the library any old rum as
jacksaid would do and all and every the beforementioned loans
would be most punctually taken care and truly enough they were for
the lender was never destined to cast an eye on any portion the loan
again i was indeed so fortunate as to catch a glimpse my globes
and instruments at a pawnbroker's and the fragments my library at
sundry bookstalls it was now high time to cut the connection for the
socraticss were rapidly withdrawing the association for want the
true golden astringent like a dumpling without its suet or a cheap
baker's quartern loaf without its doctor ie alum was falling to
pieces the worthy treasurer had retired seizing on such articles as
were most within reach and when i called upon him with my resignation
i had the pleasure seeing my own busts handsomely lining the walls 
the tooth drawer's passage i waited on the socraticss for the bums they
had been so polite as to borrow one to shew that he had profited by
studying socrates threatened to accuse me and the society a plot to
overturn the government if a syllable more on so low a subject as money
was mentioned another told me that he was just going on a visit to
abbot's park for three months and should be glad to see me when he came
back a third an unwashed artificer was so kind as to inform me that
 he had just got whitewashed and he did not care one straw
for my black looks and a fourth an indexmaker when presented
with his acceptance kindly indicated that he had not the slightest
recollection the thing and that if i persisted in compelling
payment he would bring a philosophical gentleman from cold bath
fields and two honest men from newgate to swear that it was not his
handwriting
the dropcurtain being thus let down on the last act the farce
there was no alternative between being queerly plundered or instantly
laying a horsewhip over the hungry philosophers to sue them reminded
me the proverb sue a beggar c to crack a masculine joke over
their sconces would involve an expense which the worthy philosophers
were not worth i had done an imprudent thing in joining the march 
mind and all that i could do was to brush the dust from my coat and
the mud from my shoes he that touches pitch says solomon shall
he not be denied thereby mr treasurer therefore remained in
quiet possession the busts the bookstall displayed the properly
appreciated volumes and the socratic borrowers took all the care in the
world value received
thus the day which it was intended to have been spent in amusements
out doors was passed in animated and amusing conversation over the
hospitable and convivial board and a fresh zest was added to wit and
humour by the exhilarating influence the rosy god
chapter xxxii
in london blest with competence
with temper health and common sense
none need repine or murmur nay
all may be happy in their way
e'en the lone dwelling the poor
and suffering are at least obscure
and in obscurity exempt
from poverty's worst scourge contempt
unmark'd the poor man seeks his den
unheeded issues forth again
wherefore appears he none inquires
nor why nor whither he retires
all that his pride would fain conceal
all that shame blushes to reveal
the petty shifts the grovelling cares
to which the sous want are heirs
those evils grievous to be borne
call forth not sympathy but scorn
here hidden elude the searching eye
 callous curiosity

the following morning was one unusual bustle activity and anxiety
the originally intended movements the party being thus unexpectedly
interrupted dashall had arisen before his usual hour and departed from
home before the appearance sparkle and bob to breakfast it was 
course supposed that the promised duel would have decided the fate 
one the antagonists before they should see him again
in this conjecture however they were pleasingly disappointed by his
arrival about half past eleven o'clock
well said sparkle it is all over who has fallen which is the
man how many shots what distance who was the other second and where
is the wounded hero
nay said tom you are beforehand with me i have none the
intelligence you require i have been in search lord bluster
who left town this very morning three hours before my arrival for
edinburgh and consequently i suppose either has no intimation 
laconic's intention to seek or if he has is determined to be out 
the way receiving a regular challenge so that in all probability
it will like many other duels in smoke
 notwithstanding your friend's letter was so full fire
observed tallyhoho
but perhaps he became more cool over a bottle claret toe to toe my
boy continued sparkle
this conversation was interrupted by a letter which being delivered
to tom he read aloud interrupted only by laughter which he could not
restrain
dear tom don't like fighting in england am off directly for
cork tell bluster i'll wait there till he comes but if he values
his life not to come at allplease do the needful in despatching my
servants c within two days for i am in such a passion i can't wait a
moment so adieu
yours sincerely laconic
excellent upon my word said sparkle here are two men honour
determined upon meeting running away from each other even before the
preliminaries are arranged
there is novelty in it at least said tom though i am by no means
astonished at the it for i before observed i do not think
either them over fond powder laconic pretended that nothing would
satisfy him but fighting immediately provided bluster was to be found
any person to whom his character was not known would have expected
some spilling blood before this time but it is now plain that this
blustering was the effect the wine and the man's cooler judgment has
extinguished the flame his irritability
i think said tallyhoho it would be well to advise them to meet
halfseas over and draw a cork together by way settling their
differences
curse their differences replied dashall i'll have nothing more to
do with them upon the whole i am glad now that i could not meet with
bluster or i should have looked like a fool between the two and as it
is i am not much pleased with the adventure particularly as it must
necessarily delay me and i hate the idea travelling alone i should
very much have liked to start with you but as laconic has made me fully
acquainted with his affairs in case he should fall in the intended
duel i must even comply with the contents his note though if he
had not actually departed you may rest assured i would have nothing to
do with him or his concerns
 come come cried sparkle grumbling is no use now and
as the circumstances are not made public the duellists will escape
being laughed at there is no harm done we must be upon the alert we
shortly bid adieu to london and shall not be so well pleased to
leave you behind but remember you promise to follow as quickly as
possible now how shall we dispose the remainder the time
zounds replied tom all my plans are deranged by this foolish affair
 laconic's and i can hardly tell which way to move however i shall
not devote myself to his affairs today therefore i am at your service
and as time is but short with us let us make good use it the
tragedy the duel having ended most comically i am prepared for anything
farcical therefore say the word and i am your man for a toddle
east west north or south
upon this intimation our friends sallied forth upon a sort quixotic
excursion in search adventures for neither could make up his mind
as to the precise place their destination when the first object that
attracted their particular notice was a large printed bill announcing
to the public that the sale at fonthill abbey advertised for the th
 october would not take place in consequence the property being
disposed by private contractility
 the following appeared in the daily prints relating to
this valuable property
fonthill abbey the sale at this splendid mansion is not
to take place the estate having been sold by private
contract the purchaser is said to be mr farquhar a rich
east india merchant who is reported to have given l
for the property it is stated that every article in the
abbey goes with it with the exception the family plate
and pictures and a very few favourite rarities possession
is to be taken immediately the sale the whole estate is
an event for which the people the place seem to have been
totally unprepared they were led to believe from the
beginning that nothing was to be sold but the mere luxuries
 the place but as to the abbey they universally
asserted in the strongest manner as if they had good
reason to be convinced the thing that mr beckford
would as soon part with his life as with a residence which
he prized so dearly now however that they have heard from
the steward that the estate has been sold and that he has
received notice to quit his office in a fortnight they
begin to feel that they have lost an excellent landlord mr
beckford has taken a house in town in the new road where
he means chiefly to reside in future every body is aware
that the chief part that princely income which enabled
him to raise this expensive edifice from the foundation was
derived from his paternal estates in the west indies such
was the wealth which those estates at one time produce
that it obtained for his grandfather the distinction 
being considered the richest subject in europe for the last
ten years they have declined very materially and several 
them have been entirely lost through a defect that has been
discovered in the title the original purchaser obtained
these in the way mortgage and having foreclosed them in
an technical manner advantage has been taken the
informality by the heirs the mortgagors and mr beckford
has been dispossessed the defence his title and the
other consequences involved him in losses and vast
expenses besides which the revenue from his unquestionable
estates in those islands has declined to less than onetenth
 what it formerly was mr farquhar the gentleman who is
reported to have purchased fouthill abbey is the principal
partner and proprietor whitehead's brewhouse and is
likewise at the head the first mercantile house in the
city for the management all agency concerns connected
with india
 thousands people says dashall who had been flocking to
that neighbourhood intending to obtain a view the premises will by
this event be disappointed several my friends have paid a visit toit
and describe it as a most princely mansion
and pray inquired sparkle what is the cause its being sold at
all it has always been reported that mr beckford was a man very
extensive property
that appears to be a little mysterious and report who is always a
busy fellow on extraordinary occasions has not been idle by some it is
stated that mr beckford suffered great and irreparable losses in his
west india property and that there are in the abbey at this moment
executions to the amount eighty thousand pounds that the view the
effects has taken place entirely under the control the sheriffs by
others it is asserted that no such embarrassment exists however be
that as it may the public have been highly gratified for some time past
in being permitted to view the estate and the valuable curiosities it
contains and the produce the admission tickets which has probably
netted twenty thousand pounds goes to the liquidation the debts
 and an excellent plan for raising the wind too said tallyhoho
the example i suppose has been taken from wanted house
most likely was the reply but if it is true that the disposal 
the property is occasioned by the embarrassment its owner it cannot
but excite painful and melancholy reflections on the tenure by which
men hold the goods this life those who were acquainted with mr
beckford's circumstances some years ago thought him so secured in the
enjoyment a princely income that he was absolutely out the reach
 ill fortune being at one time in the actual receipt one hundred
thousand pounds a year it cannot be said him that he has wasted his
inheritance at the gamingtable the palace which he raised on a barren
mountain the greater part those vast plantations which surround it
the collection books and rare specimens art and the superb
furniture which gives such peculiar dignity and splendour to the
interior his residence speak at once the immensity his means and
attest the propriety and gracefulness their application
we ought to have taken a trip there to have seen this earthly
paradise rejoined tallyhoho but now i suppose it is all over
certainly was the reply and it is a circumstance for which the
people in the neighbourhood appear to have been totally unprepared they
were led to believe from the beginning that the mere luxuries 
the place were to be sold and the public announcement this had the
effect filling the county wilts with pleasurehunters from all
quarters he was fortunate who for some time past could find a
vacant chair within twenty miles fonthill the solitude a private
apartment was a luxury which few could hope for and an old friend
 mine informs me in one his letters that coming from london
travellers first met their troubles about salisbury the languages 
france holland and germany the peculiarities in tongue 
scotland and ireland the broad dialect somersetshire the tinkling
accent wales and the more polished tones metropolitan residents
were all at the same moment to be heard clashing and contending there
were bells ringing and chambermaids screaming horses prancing and
postboys swearing wheels clattering and waiters jostling guests
threatening and hubbub and confusion the orders the day and all
this to see something which half them when they got there if they
were so fortunate could not obtain a sight so that perhaps we
have been quite as well off in remaining at home
 that was spoken like a philosopher said sparkle
dryly but pray who is to be the future possessor this fine
estate
a mr farquhar who according to the best information i have obtained
is a man an extraordinary character and has given l for it
as it stands with every article in the abbey except the family plate
and pictures and a few very favourite rarities some interesting
particulars the purchaser have recently been made known from which
it appears that he is a native aberdeen and went out early in life
to india where he was employed in the medical department chemical
research was his favourite pursuit there was some defect in the manner
 manufacturing gunpowder and mr farquhar was selected to give his
assistance by degrees he obtained the management the concern and
finally he became the sole contractor to the government in this way
wealth and distinction rapidly poured in upon him after some years 
labour he returned to england with half a million money and it is
somewhat curious that a man possessed so much money upon his arrival
at gravesend should merely to save the expense coachhire walk upto
london which however it appears he did when his first visit
very naturally was to his banker without waiting for refreshment or
alteration attire full dust and dirt with clothes not worth a
guinea he presented himself at the counter and asked for mr courts
the clerks not much prepossessed in his favour by his appearance
disregarded his application and he was suffered to remain in the
cashoffice under the idea his being some poor petitioner until mr
courts passing through it recognized his indian customer the man whom
he expected to see with all the pomp a nabob mr farquhar requested
to have five pounds which having received he took his departure this
anecdote strongly marks the character and habits the man he soon
afterwards settled in upper bakerstreet where his house was to be
distinguished by its dingy appearance uncleaned windows and general
neglect an old woman was his sole attendant and his apartment to
which a brush or broom was never applied was kept sacred from her care
his neighbours were not acquainted with his character and there have
been instances some them offering him money as an object 
charity
 an admirable tenant for such a place as fonthill truly
observed sparkle why what the devil will he do with it now he has
got it
perhaps said dashall i ought to refer you to the man himself for
an answer to such a question for i am at a loss to guess he is now
sixtyfive years age and still in single blessedness
a very enviable situation remarked sparkle however continued tom
he has done some good in the world and may live to do more he became
a partner in the great agency house in the city basset farquhar
and co besides which he purchased the late mr whitehead's share in
the brewery part his great wealth was devoted to the purchase 
estates but the great bulk was invested in stock and suffered to
increase on compound interest he is deeply read in ancient and modern
literature and has a mind extraordinary vigour and originality
his conversation a superior order impressive and animated on every
subject his sentiments are liberal and strangely contrasted with his
habits his religious opinions are peculiar and seem to be influenced
by an admiration the purity the lives and moral principles the
brahmins it is said that he offered l to found a college in
aberdeen with a reservation on points religion to which however
the sanction the legislature could not be procured and the plan
was dropped he has been residing in gloucesterplace where he
has furnished a house in a style modern elegance and so far
as appearances are concerned indulges in several luxuries but his
domestic habits are still the same and his table seldom labours with
the pressure heavy dishes he has one nephew to whom he allows or
did allow l per year has but few other claims family and it
is probable that his immense wealth will be bequeathed to charitable
purposes as the great object his ambition is to leave his name to
posterity as the founder some public institution to that passion
may perhaps be attributed the purchase fonthill abbey for his age
and infirmities totally unfit him for the enjoyment such 
a place he is diminutive in person and by no means prepossessing in
appearance his dress has all the qualities the antique to recommend
it and his domestic expenditure until the last year has not exceeded
l per annum although his possessions money in the funds and
capital in trade are said to amount to a million and a half
why he is an oddity indeed exclaimed tallyhoho and i think he ought
to be exhibited as the eighth wonder the world
certainly we cannot look upon the like every day there are instances
it is said his having returned letters merely because the postage
was not paid although he has on more than one or two occasions given
away at once for praiseworthy purposes ten and twenty thousand
pounds
then rejoined sparkle he is a trump and deserves to be
respected but where are we bound to
nay replied tom i have no choice upon the subject
nor i neither said gayfield stepping smartly up to him and catching
him by the hand so come along i'll guide you to good quarters and
comfortable accommodation dine with me and we will have a cut in at
whist what say you
this proposition was acceded to and away they went to gayfield's
apartments where a very hospitable and friendly entertainment was
presented to them with every mark a hearty welcome in the evening
the glass circulated freely and cards being introduced they enjoyed an
agreeable and pleasant game at which nothing particular occurred after
which they jumped into a rattler and were conveyed home very well
satisfied with every attention they had received from gayfield except
the eternal rattle his tongue
chapter xxxiii
the proper study mankind in food

next morning while our party were at breakfast who should make his
appearance but gayfield whose elasticity spirits and volubility 
tongue appeared if possible to have acquired an additional impulse 
action
my dear fellow he commenced addressing bob as you are so soon
about to leave us i feel anxious you should carry with you all the
information possible on that interesting subject life in london long
as your stay in the metropolis has been still where the subjects
are so varying so ever varying so multifarious and the field for
observation so unlimited it is impossible but that something must have
escaped your notice
i have been scribbling to a friend in the country whom i occasionally
endeavour to amuse with sketches scenes in london and as i
flatter myself it exhibits something novelty both in character
situation and incident you shall hear it
dear dick i told you that i was about to have the honour being
introduced to tin celebrated dr kitchen he was a man take him for
all in all i ne'er shall look upon his like again it was evidently
one nature's worst journeymen that made him for he has not a limb
which appears to appertain to his body they look precisely as if they
were purchased at an auction this little man who seems born to be
girded at by jokers all classes sharing the prevalent rage for
notoriety has written two works one in the character a gourmand 
and the other a musician but not content with the fame he has thus
acquired he has persuaded himself that he is an excellent singer nay
it was given out lately by his own concurrence that he intended to
sing at a concert at the argyle rooms and although he has no more voice
than a cat he was under the full impression that his majesty
at the conclusion the last courtday intended to call upon him fora
song the doctor asked me and caustic to one his literary dinners
and as t have supplied you with a sketch a cookshop gourmand i
make no apology for shewing up a more elevated class gastronomes 
by reporting the doctor's speech on this occasion
eon entering the world the acuteness my palate and vigour 
digestion disposed me to conceive that i should excel in the fraternal
sciences eating and drinking and i entertained no doubt but my vapid
organs would be considerably improved by frequent exercise taste
has various departments painting architecture sculpture c but
impressed with the conviction that my only office in this world was to
invent new dishes and devour them i collected all the culinary writers
from caxton to mons ude modern celebrity as science proceeds by
gradual advances i frequented the better sort coffeehouses to
initiate myself in the correct nomenclature different dishes and
to judge their skilful preparation these to be sure are proper
schools for a beginner but i soon discovered that these victuallers
on account their numerous visitants who are disposed to eat much and
pay little could not afford to furnish the most costly and exquisite
entrees sometimes i found that the same turkey had been twice
subjected to the spit a sole that had been broiled the day before
underwent the operation frying on the following cold meat appeared
as hot pie with many other curious and ingenious devices then the wine
was so adulterated compelled like a melancholic patient to look
old before its time and fitted like a pauper with a readymade coat
perceptibly impregnated with bad brandy and tasted every thing
but the grape that in about six months i sickened and no longer
frequented these tasteless and inhospitable retreats for the hungry
to view the ordinary arrangements a modern dinner is a sorry
sight a dozen articles placed at once upon the table then on
the removal the covers comes the ferocious onset some tremulous
paralytic serving the soup and scattering it in all directions
excepting into the plate where it ought to be delivered then
an unhandy dandy mutilates the fish by cutting it in a wrong direction
here an officious ignoramus tears asunder the members a fowl as
coarsely as the four horses dragged ravillac limb from limb there
another simpleton notching a tongue into dissimilar slices while a
purblind coxcomb confounds the different sauces pouring anchovy on
pigeonpie and parsley and butter on roastbeef all these barbarisms
are unknown at my table
perhaps one the most gratifying things in nature far beyond anything
hitherto conveyed by landscape or historical painting is to
behold my guests in silence sip their wine as the glass is held up the
eye and the orient liquor reciprocally sparkle its bouquet expands the
nostrils elevates the eyebrow to admiration and composes the lips to
a smile when its crystal receptacle which is as thin as indian paper
for observe to use a thick wineglass is to drink with a gag in your
mouth touches the lips they become compress to allow the thinnest
possible stream to enter that its flavour be thoroughly ascertained
and that successive perceptions palatable flavour may terminate in
the gulph ecstacy
i am fully aware that the pleasures the table cannot be indulged
without some hazard to the constitution it is therefore the business
 my serious reflections to counteract the invasions disease and
provide timely remedies for its attack a gold box is always placed on
the table with the desert containing a store pills which are 
a very moving quality and speedy operation called peristaltic
persuaders in an adjoining room there is a basin as large as an
ordinary washingtub with a copper chamomiletea and a upper is
engaged to be in constant attendance till the guests depart
gentlemen i once became a member a fashionable dinnerclub
managed by a superintending committee who purchased their own wine
and engaged a culinary artist established reputation this club was a
diversified assemblage consisting some sprigs the nobility and
a few old standards several members parliament who became very
troublesome by repeating the speeches that had been uttered in the
house and were besides always attempting to reform the club but this
was less offensive to me than others as i make it a rule never
to attend to conversation unless it relates to improvements in cookery
the remainder our club was composed a few hungry querulous
lawyers two or three doctors who had increased the means gratifying
their appetites by destroying the digestive faculties their patients
there is nothing permanent in the world therefore in about two years
the club dwindled away a set rascally economists complained 
expense the cook a very honest man and skilful professor was
accused peculation by the reformers and turned adrift for modestly
demonstrating that he could not make turtle out tripe nor convert
sprats into red mullet several members moved off without paying
their arrears the managing committee disposed the premises plate
furniture and wines and pocketed the money and thus the club was
dissolved
it was on this occasion that the doctor proposed his celebrated
committee taste with the proceedings which i shall perhaps
have occasion at some future time to make you acquainted
gayfield's humorous epistle amused the party much and bob felt
complimented by the attention paid to the finish his studies 
metropolitan life and manners the fine appearance the morning
determined them on a stroll through the leading thoroughfares as it
would afford tallyhoho the opportunity completing such purchases as
were necessary prior to his departure for the country in passing
covent garden their attention was attracted by a numerous and grotesque
assemblage in which they soon mixed and were highly diverted by the
following whimsical exhibition displaying the astonishing sagacity and
feelings the monkey species an itinerant showman who for some time
past exhibited two dancing monkeys about the town had pitched his stage
in a part the market when his poles and cords were fixed and the
monkeys in their full dress were about to commence the celebrated
flying pitman came by with his basket and having furnished himself
with a bottle gin he leaped upon the stage and treated the showman
and one the monkeys with a glass each the other monkey however
declined taking any and was leaping about to avoid it but the pitman
served out the second glass and the former monkey took his with
apparent gladness the pitman again seized the monkey who
declined it before but he still scorned to take any the bysanders
called out to the pitman to throw it at him and the pitman flung it
in his face instantly the monkey who drank the gin and who was half
drunk by this time to resent the injury sprang upon the pitman seized
him by the arm and would have torn that piece the flesh entirely
out only for its master who with much difficulty made him relinquish
his hold the pitman was dangerously wounded and was carried to a
doctor's shop to get his arm dressed
passing on the next object attention was the police office bow
street here the party determined to rest for a short time and after
listening to several uninteresting cases relating to hackney coach
fares they were at length rewarded for their lost time and patience
by a case in which the tables were completely turned upon mr jehu and
which we hope will act as a caution to others the profession who have
a taste for swearing and abuse
chapter xxxiv
in cities foul example on most minds
begets its likeness rank abundance breeds
in gross and pamper'd cities sloth and lust
and wantonness and gluttonous excess
in cities vice is hidden with more ease
or seen with least reproach and virtue taught
by frequent lapse can hope no triumph there
beyond th achievement successful flight
i do confess them nurseries the arts
in which they flourish most where in the beams
 warm encouragement and in the eye
 public note they reach their perfect size
such london is by taste and wealth proclaim'd
the fairest capital all the world
by riot and incontinence the worst

the arrival the day for separation was anticipated and the morning
arose upon dashall with a gloomy aspect originating in the temper 
his mind for he was by no means pleased with the adventure laconic
which operated to prevent his departure with his friends sparkle and
tallyhoho were however upon the alert and determined on pursuing their
original intentions tom had none his usual vivacity about him
in vain he tried to muster up his spirits his attempts at wit were
pointless and did not escape the notice sparkle who secretly enjoyed
his chagrin feeling assured that as it was created by their departure
he would not delay joining them longer than necessity absolutely
required why how now tom said sparkle you are out and seem to be
in queer stirrups as if you had an uneasy saddle you seem to part
with your cousin as a young man would with the beloved his heart i
confess i am disappointed replied tom
but since grieving's a folly
why let us be jolly
 i am determined to spend the last moments with you so start
off the rattle traps the upper toggery's and travelling caps we will
take a last turn together and a parting dinner and glass wine at
the bull and mouth and i'll warrant you i won't be long behind all i
regret is i can't accompany you at present upon this intimation the
remainder their luggage and clothing were despatched by a servant
with an order to provide a good dinner for them at half past five
things were now all m a fair train and this business being despatched
all was anxiety for the arrival the moment though with different
sensations sparkle to meet his wife bob to return to his native home
and tom displeased and disappointed in every way although he determined
to be as agreeable as he could under existing circumstances time
however being heavy on their hands but as bob was anxious to make a few
more purchases for presents on his return home they started early for
the bull and mouth
you have now said dashall to his cousin had some experience in real
life in london and i have reason to think you will not return to the
country a worse man than you left it variety is charming and the
change from one to the other will give additional zest and pleasure
i have reason replied bob to feel myself under a very particular
obligation to you for the excellent care kindness and attention as
well as information i have derived and it cannot easily be obliterated
from my recollection but i at the same time must observe that i have
no very great relish for london as a continual residence when you
arrive in the country i will try if i cannot be as explanatory and
amusing at all events i expect you will give me the trial
i'll give you a chevy over the hills a pop at the pheasants and a
pick at them afterwards besides which you know we have some very
pretty lasses in our neighbourhood to whom you have already been
introduced and to whom you shall be better known
i know i know said tom in a hurried manner which strongly
indicated some other motive for regret than that which arose from mere
disappointment at not being a partner in their journey and from which
sparkle did not fail to draw an inference that some roguish eyes had
been darting their beams into the bosom his friend
 i see how it is now cried sparkle tom is not cut but
caught and i'll sport a fifty that the evergreen tom dashall 
london will be transplanted to entwine with some virgin blossom the
country before another twelve months
tom was silent
tallyhoho smiled in accordance with the sentiment sparkle and declared
he would not take the bet
it's very little use cried dashall recovering himself after a
short pause i may as well make a merit necessity i confess i
have a sort a liking for the gay and sprightly lydia forcetext the
parson's daughter and if but curse if's i hate if i wish there was
no such word in the english language
ha ha ha exclaimed sparkle i thought we should find you out but
come i think i may say there is not much for you to fear if you are
but serious
it is a serious subject and if we continue this conversation i shall
grow downright sentimental so no more at present we have not much time
to spare and as i mean to make use every minute let us look around
for any novelty that may occur before your departure
well said sparkle i must say i do not know any thing so new tome
as the very subject we were upon but as you wish it dropped why
e'en let it be so i have no desire to be either particular or
personal
and as london's the object we've long had in view
as long as we can we'll that object pursue
and as visions we know have been for an old grudge meant
we'll make ours a view not a vision judgment
good said tom and as the lines are extemporaneous we will not be
overnice in the criticism
at least continued sparkle you will admit it is better to be a bad
poet than a bad man
agreed agreed replied tom but who in the name wonder have
we here the emperor hairdressers and headcutters turned
printseller why this was money's where i have before now had a
clip
 nay nay said sparkle don't be in a hurry to form your
judgment his ingenuity is at work and really it will be worth while
to have a cut all round for i find he gives a portrait displaying
the most fashionable parisian dresses to every customer some you
know present bank or more properly speaking flush notes upon these
occasions but certainly this is a less exceptionable plan what say
you
with all my heart and into the magazine de mode they marched to
which they were welcomed by the artist himself ushered up stairs
with all due politeness and in two minutes sparkle was under his
incomparable hands while tom and bob amused themselves with a peep at
the newspapers and the gazette fashion
fine morning gentlemen said the friseur
is there any news asked sparkle
we have the paris papers sir regularly and a constant supply 
drawings the newest fashion
i am more for domestic or home news continued sparkle
not aware sir any thing particular oh yes i recollect i was
told last night over at the haunch that the mermaid is discovered
what said tom discover a mermaid over a haunch laying down the
paper
beg pardon sir beg pardon a trifling mistake sir nothing more i
usually pass a recreative hour after my daily studies at the haunch
 venison over the way the landlord is an intelligent accommodating
and agreeable sort man and we have many gentlemen considerable
consequence both literary and scientific who meet there an evening
to pass a convivial hour to hear and impart the news and sir as i
was saying the mermaid is stated to be a fine hoax upon the credulity
 john bull being nothing more than the body or skin a smokedried
old woman ingeniously connected with the tail a fish i don't vouch
for the truth the report i only state what i hear and can only
assert with confidence what i am acquainted with in my own business
i suspected the mermaid from the first answered tom i thought there
was some deceit in it
there is a great deal deceit in the world sir replied the active
clipper a little circassian cream sir acknowledged to be the best
article ever produced for the preservation and restoration hair
certainly said sparkle
 in this way our friends obtained a portion amusement and
a corinthian clip from the intelligent and communicative mr money 
fleet street notoriety in return for which he touched their coin
now said dashall we will make the best our way and just call
by way taking a lunch among the lads newgate market there is
a house where i have been before in which we can have some very
fine homebrewed ale c and besides according to the landlord's
advertisements he has opened an academy and gives instruction in
the art brewing the college physicians is just opposite and i
suppose this wag a landlord has taken the hint and opposed his beer
to their physic perhaps you may wish to carry his valuable receipt into
the country with you
i have no inclination to turn brewer replied sparkle but i
must confess i like the idea a little genuine beer free from the
poisonous ingredients the public brewer
and so do i continued tallyhoho come along then said tom the
bell in warwick lane is the shop where you may be served to a shaving
in passing along warwick lane bob observed he thought his friend was
leading him through a not very agreeable neighbourhood
this place is filled with slaughterhouses and is to be sure a great
nuisance to the city yet such places are necessary therefore bear up
a few minutes and you will have comfortable houseroom and agreeable
refreshment entering the bell they were met by the landlord the
house a roundfaced goodnatured real johnbulllooking man
who knowing his customer dashall immediately ushered them into the
coffeeroom where being supplied with stout and muttonchops in high
perfection they enjoyed themselves with their regale this done they
had an opportunity looking about them
in one corner sat two or three tiptop salesmen the market
conversing on the price meat while they were devouring a succession
 rumpsteaks with most voracious and insatiable appetites in another
was a hungry author bargaining with a bookseller paternoster row
for the sale a manuscript by which he expected to realise a dinner
while near them was an undertaker and a masterbuilder vociferating at
each other for interference with their respective trades and
so far attracting the attention the bookseller from the work the
author that he wished from the bottom his heart that one would
build a coffin to bury the other while the salesmen laughed so loud at
the observations the controversialists as almost to make them wish
the subject dead without the hope resurrection
bob liked the stout ordered a replenish and asked the landlord to
partake
with all my heart gentlemen good health real malt and hops
gentlemen nothing else all brewed under my own eye good ordinary at
two excellent fare good treatment comfortable beds happy to see you
at all times at the bell brewery
having proceeded on their journey they shortly found themselves near
bull and mouth street
on their way to the bull and mouth sparkle made a proposal which was
cordially acquiesced in by dashall and his cousin and a mutual pledge
was given to carry it into effect this was no other than an agreement
to take a trip over to dublin in the course the ensuing winter in
order to acquire some knowledge life in ireland
i have lately said sparkle been almost convulsed with laughter
even to the danger a lockedjaw by the perusal a work under
this title the author nephew to a late irish chancellor is an old
acquaintance added to which and the genuine irresistible humour that
runs throughout the work i feel determined to visit and have ocular
demonstration some the places where these scenes humour are so
admirably described
on entering bull and mouth street bless me cried bob this is a
very confined street for such an inn
hoy cried a coachman rattling along the street in double quick time
by your leave bawled a porter with a heavy chest on his back
we shall certainly either be knocked down or run over exclaimed
tallyhoho
never fear said tom do but keep your ogles in action all's right
enough and we shall soon be safely housed out the bustle but before
we enter the house we will just cast our eyes about us on the right
after passing the gate is the coachoffices for receiving booking
 and delivering parcels and taking places for passengers by the
various vehicles which start from this place on the left is the hotel
and coffeehouse where every refreshment and accommodation may be
obtained the remaining part the building together with several
others adjoining which almost occupy the whole this side 
the street are devoted to stables waggon and coachhouses and
outoffices
illustration pagejpg bull and mouth inn
it is an extensive concern then said tallyhoho though it stands in
such an out the way obscure situation
why you are already aware that situation is not absolutely necessary
to success in all cases in london was the reply the extensive
circulation a name or a sign are sometimes sufficient to obtain
business and who has not heard the bull and mouth or the name 
willan from the former runs a considerable number long stages and
mail coaches daily and nightly the proprietor being a contractor with
government and upon one occasion it is said he was in treaty to supply
an immense quantity horses to convey troops to the coast on the
threatened invasion by buonaparte so that the epithet patriotic might
properly be applied to him he however is lately deceased and supposed
to have left a considerable fortune but come dinner is ready now for
the parting meal and then heaven speed ye to your destined homes
after partaking a hearty dinner and a bottle or two generous
wine come said dashall it is time we are alive and look out for
the yard is all in a bustle here are lots coaches preparing for a
start so let us get out look around and see what is going forward
upon this intimation they sallied forth to the yard where the
confusion created by the arrival one coach heavily laden and
the preparation two for departure afforded a scene for a quiet
contemplation which however it is not easy to describe
coachman said an antiquated lady just alighting i paid my fare
yes ma'am that's all fair said coach
mind how you hand my dear little boy out the coach poor little
fellow he is quite dizzy with riding
 i thinks as how you had better have brought a man with you
for you want taking care yourself grumbled coach as he handed the
young one out there he is ma'am stand upon your pins my man
come charley oh coach you have got my box in your boot
aye aye ma'am i know it i wish my boot was in your box here it is
ma'am
stand bye said a jack tar let's have a little sea room and no
squalls
coach what a rude fellow that is he says i squalls
never mind him ma'am he is as rough as the element he belongs
to thank ye ma'am that's the time o day pocketing a halfcrown
which she had just given him
here bill take this lady's luggage out the way
just going off sir do you go by me
yes replied sparkle how many have you inside
only four sir and you two make up the number all ready jem bear up
the leaders
at this moment a hackney coach stopped at the gate and out jumps a
gentleman who immediately entered into conversation with the coachman
can't do it sir said coach all full i might manage to give you
an outside passage to be sure
well well i will make that do perhaps you can afford an inside birth
part the journey
i'll see what i can do but can't promise now gentlemen
here coachman said the person desirous obtaining a passage
tipping coach some money
aye aye that's the way to look at the matter
by this time tom discovered it was no other than van butchell whom
he observed to bob there was little doubt had been summoned on some
desperate case and must go at all events
 it is fortunate for the rising generation that the late
martin van butcher not more celebrated for his
eccentricities than his utility has not departed from the
world without leaving an able successor to his practice
edwin martin van butcher is now almost as well known as his
late father such indeed is the estimation his abilities
that a large society journeymen tailors have entered into
a weekly subscription among themselves in order that their
afflicted brethren may have the benefit his practical
knowledge and abilities
now gentlemen you brush in and i will brush on shut the door dick
all right ya hip
adieu dear tom exclaimed bob
 zounds exclaimed tom the coachman will hardly allow him to
say good bye well the dearest friends must part so good bye heaven
protect you both
by this time the vehicle was out the yard
i don't like it continued tom soliloquizing with himself but
however as i have bid them adieu for the present the best thing i
can do is to arrange laconic's affairs and then bid adieu to life in
