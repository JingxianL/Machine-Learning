the publicationof a work which is intended toestablish the principles of morality onwhat appears to me their only true andsure foundation namely their influenceupon the happiness of mankindit had often occurred to me that itwould be rendering some service tothose whose opinions will be theopinions of the coming generations ifthe theory of genuine morals could beelucidated for the service of the youngby the blending of amusement and instructionx prefaceand in the attempt to accomplishso important a purpose i felt encouragementfrom a frequently repeatedobservation of mr bentham's thatnothing is wanting for the establishmentof sound opinions in all questionsof right and wrong but the determinationto follow the consequences ofactions into the regions of pain andpleasure no better guide for judgmenthas i believe been ever proposed and my conviction is as strongas it can be that it is impossible toadd to the stock of virtue withoutadding to that of felicity or to increasethe amount of felicity without increasingthat of virtuewith the exception of those illusprefacexirationis which have been borrowedfrom history most of the facts referredto belong to my own observation andexperience and i have the ratherchosen to draw on such sources fromthe conviction that the everyday wantsofhfe afford to every man ample scopefor the application of that standard ofmorality whose universal recognitionwill as i behaves be the characteristicof a new and better erathis little is launched as anexperiment if welcomed it will befollowed by others in which

arthur howard to hisfather and his brother george as they weregoing out for an early country walk arthur'sattention had been excited by a shabbily dressedman who was belaboring a roughcoatedfeeble and blind old horse that was draggingor rather attempting to drag a cart with aheavy load of vegetables to market thepoor creature tried and tried but could notget the wheels out of the rut in which theyhad stuck and the driver whose anger increasedwith the increased but vain attemptsof the horse to move onward was dealing minor moralsout ms blows most unmercifully about theanimals legs and bead and swearing moreloudly and laying on more violently at everystroke what an abominable rascal exclaimedarthur again til iv and awayhe scampered almost as much in a passion asthe man whom he was going to reprimandand to punishnow see said his father to george inwhat an unfit state arthur is for doing ahumane thing ho intends to act kindly andgenerously but he will most likely makematters worse he will only exasperate theman the more and the poor beast will be thesufferer for his imprudencewhat do you mean you worthless vagabondv cried arthur when out of breath andhardly able to find words for his rage hecame up to the carter what what doanger iitou mean by treating the poor horse sowickedly what do i mean mr impertinentthere that's what i mean upon whichhe turned upon the silent and suffering creaturewith far greater violence than before andsmote him so ferociously that every blow madearthur's heart shudder within him and now young gentleman if you don'tmove off said the man mayhap i may tryhow you like the stick upon your own shouldersby way of teaching you how to meddle withother peoples concernedarthur was a boy of humane and generousdispositions and he could not immediately seethat he had done anything wrong by giving wayto what he had perhaps thought as many otherswould have thought a natural and proper sentimentof indignation yet he felt he must havemade some mistake for he had failed in his minor moralspurpose and with a spirit somewhat brokenand subdued he ran back to his father and hisbrother well my boy v were the first words heheard from his father and what have yougot by throwing yourself into such a toweringpassions how could i help it papa wheni saw that mans frightful cruelty buthas your passion been of any service to youarthur did it help you to persuade thecruel man or to rescue the suffering beastyou intended to do what was humane i know but you set about it rashly your anger wasmore violent than your reason you were morebent upon punishing than preventing an offence and though you proposed to do good you haveonly done evilsbut tell us papa said george whosetemper was more sedate and whose judgmentanger more cool tian his brother's is anger neverjustifiable never commendable must one seeall sorts of wicked and improper conduct andnot be angry with it i have often heardindignation called generous and anger virtuousare they never so never my son for what is anger itis pain pain inflicted on yourself by whichyou are excited to inflict pain on anotherit may be necessary to inflict pain on anotherfor that other's good and for the good of societybut your being angry is just the way to preventyou from properly judging what pain and howmuch pain it is right to inflict in order to producethat good now if arthur instead of breakingout into a storm of passion had first consideredwhat he really meant to do which was toinduce that ignorant man to refrain from misusingthat unfortunate beast he would have preventedb minor moralsthree mischiefs the mischief of being in a passion with all its pains annoyances and disappointments the mischief to the animal whichhas only suffered the more from his interferenceand the mischief to the carter whomhe has but exasperated the more and perhapsstrengthened in his vicious propensities'the lesson was borne in mind and as is thecase with all good and useful lessons an earlyopportunity was found of applying it to practicethe morning walk was continued it was agreat delight for the lads to ramble into thefields with their father soon after break of day and such walks were the frequent rewards oftheir good behaviour the day before on suchoccasions mr howard was accustomed to talkto them on all the subjects of their studies andto make it his invariable rule to tell them somethingthey had not heard before for he hadanger travelled much and studied mueli and whatwas best of all his travels and his studies andall his thoughts had been always busied inmaking others happyof course he was universally loved for it isbut natural we should love those who do uskind services and there is no service so kindas that of making us happyhe talked to his boys of the beauties ofnature that surrounded them and showed themin what a wonderful variety of ways beauty isa source of pleasure he bade them listen tothe songs of the birds to the fall of thewaters to the thousand sounds of the earthand air teaching them how each added somethingto the great account of living happinesswhen the wind blew in their faces or the sunshone on their foreheads or the frost bit theends of their fingers he told them how each minor moralsadministered to mans enjoyment if the airwas fragrant with the flowers of spring or thesweet hay of summer he explained to themhow the organs of smell were made subservientto the same great end and as they looked uponthe different tribes of busy creatures partakingof the various food presented to them by theirmakers munificence he pointed out hownumerous their pleasures how perpetually renewedhow marvellously provided for howinfinitely spread sees said he the greatpurpose of providence the general lesson ofcreation happiness and the thought again came over arthur'smind that anger never made anybody thehappierthey returned homeward their walk hadbeen long longer than usual whom shouldthey meet but the carman who had excitedanger yso much of arthur's indignation a few hoursbefore he had delivered his cartload to themarket gardener and was walking sulkily bythe side of his cart every now and then givingthe poor horse a heavy stroke with his stickthe horse however being now relieved ofhis burthen moved on with something likeactivity the man no sooner saw arthurapproaching than as if in pure spite and contradictionhe struck his beast a vehement blowupon his nose but arthur had learnt wisdom and his father was charmed to see that he wasstruggling to check the outbreak of his angerhe however went to the carter who beganto scowl at him as he approached expectingno doubt another violent scolding but arthurhad found out his mistake the man perceivedthe difference and his own looks changed asarthur said to him in a quiet and gentle tone minor morals i spoke to you improperly this morning i am sorry for it the man did not give thehorse another blow and once or twice asgeorge and arthur turned round to watchwhat was going on which they did very cautiouslyindeed they saw the carter kindlypatting his poor beast upon the back and heardhim singing in the distance a goodhumoredsongcouragein the evening george and arthur went intotheir father's library to give an account of theschool business of the day i have beenreading said george such an interestingstory in livy where he tells of the courageand devotedness of the young curtis whata fine example of patriotism papa v butarthur had not read the roman historian andgeorge was called upon to describe the eventwhich he did in the following words it wasbetween three and four hundred years beforethe christian era when a large gap suddenlyopened in the forum at rome the peoplewere affrighted and consulted the oracles asto the meaning of so alarming a catastrophe minor moralsthe oracles answered that the gap would notclose until the greatest treasures of rome wereflung into it upon this a young roman whosename was curtis asked his countrymen whetherthey possessed any treasures so great as theirweapons and their courage they acknowledgedthey had none and the young curtisclad himself in full armour mounted his horseplunged into the chasm and perished thepeople gathered round and poured offeringsof flowers and fruits after him into the voidwhich soon closed over him but can the storybe true papa the probability is my boysin this as in other instances where miraculousevents are spoken of by the classical historiansthat a portion of truth is the groundwork uponlivy has the candor to confess that he sometimesrecords the expressions of a credulous age and excuseshimself if in speaking of the past his mind is under theinfluences produced by the tone of ancient days xliii courage which a fable has been raised but in this caseit does not seem very difficult to separate thefacts from the fictions it appears to me mostlikely that curtis was destroyed by one of thegreat earthquakes which have so frequentlyvisited italy and sometimes changed the characterof the surface of the country curtiswas perhaps some young man distinguished forhis rank and his virtues who perished with hisarmour on while assisting the citizens duringthe sufferings created by such an event hisname and deeds were kept alive in the memoryof generations till in progress of time theywere associated with that fabulous decorationwhich now accompanies them another historianfestus speaks of the place where the chasmwas as having been covered with water andbeing called the curtis lacus and it isvery likely that a lake would be the result ofthe changes which an earthquake would produce minor moralswas it not if true a very brave and heroicaction papa was not his courage very praiseworthy do you think in these days so muchof selfdevotion would be found inquiredgeorge i say yes to all your questions georgethe action was courageous was praiseworthy and i believe if needful imitators would notnow be found wanting i do not think any realvirtue has diminished in the world and i amsure some virtues have greatly increased i am glad continued mr howard youhave introduced the subject for i wished toshow yon that courage is not always a virtueand therefore not always worthy your admirationor your applause if it is not useful forsome good purpose it has nothing in it todeserve approval the courage of a bad ranmay be exceedingly vicious the timidity of agood man may be preeminently virtuouscouragecourage only enables a man to subdue difficulties but the difficulties may be in the wayeither of his wisdom or his folly i will give you a few examples and youshall tell me whether courage is always intitledto praise and you will try to distinguishbetween the courage that is virtuous and thatwhich is not so during my travels in spain i fell in witha famous bandit chieftain whose name wasjayme alfonso a man whose adventures werefar more romantic and marvellous than thoseof either the english freebooter robin hoodor the scotch mountaineer rob toy jaymewas brave but not cruel and i say this becausesome writers have hastily and thoughtlessly saidthat no brave man was ever cruel but myboys there have been many men very braveand very cruel it happens that people get intotheir beads a notion that courage is a virtue minor moralsalways a virtue so when they find mencommitting cruel acts they deny these menescourage though their courage is really asremarkable as their cruelty this comes fromthe confused notions that the world is filledwith as to what is virtue and what notjayme was one of the most courageous meni ever knew or heard of he was dauntedby no dangers he seemed never to think ofhis privations he lived year after year amidstthe rocks and the forests and sometimes forwhole months entered no human habitationit was his custom to order his band to disperseat sunset and he invariably fixed on someplacefor their meeting at break of day jaymehowever had many virtuous qualities andwhen the remembrances of the past came overhim when he thought of the days of his youthand his innocence regrets and penitence sometimesbroke out in tears i had when in spaincourage a muleteer for a servant who told me that abrother of his a boy who had wandered awayfrom crevillente the birthplace of jaymeonce saw a man sitting on a rock hangingover a stream weeping bitterly he soonfound from his dress appearance and thenumber of weapons he wore that it was jaymethe robber and being much alarmed took tohis heels and ran away but jayme summonedhim back seized him by the hand andinquiring his name told him he knew hisfamily and that they were honest people andthat he hoped the boy would be honest too for he said am jayme el ladrone andvery wretched am i indeed yet i was onceas innocent and as happy as you but i was about to tell you an instance ofjaymes courage the governor of crevillentehad been long in search of jayme and his bandthey had done so many kind things to thec minor moralspeasantry they had provided food for thenecessitous in the time of a dearth and hadso frequently relieved them with the moneythey had plundered from travellers that jaymewas popular throughout all the district andnot a villager or cottager would betray him orhis companions a regiment of soldiers hadbeen for years kept marching and countermarchingin pursuit of jayme who had oftensurprised them and had even carried away someof the officers to his mountain haunts and onone occasion where a lieutenant had beenwounded and left for dead in a skirmish withthe bandits jayme took him to some of thedeepest solitudes of the neighbourhood curedhim of his wounds and conducted him safelyto the main road which led to the town ofcrevillente jaymes mother lived in thattown she was a respectable person independentthough not wealthy and one daycourage the governor exasperated with jayme'slong resistance and weary of his own vainattempts to capture him ordered jaymesmother to be arrested thrown into prisonand levied a heavy fine upon her declaringshe should not have her liberty tillshe divulged the hiding place of her son shecould not have done this if she would forjayme never communicated to her any ofhis proceedings so that the conduct of thegovernor was alike useless unjust and cruelthe next daw it was before the sun hadarisen a sternfaced man with a rifle in hishand and several pistols in his belt his bare legsgirded with the chickweed sandals worn by thevalencia peasantry and clad in one of thosebutton covered vests whose arms hang overthe shoulders and often entangle themselveswith the many colored ribands that float fromthe band of the sombrero hat a stern faced minoe moralsman appeared at the gate of the governor'sabode and said he came on matters of extremeurgency and must have an instant audience ofhis excellency his presence awed the guardand supposing perhaps that he was a messengerof the government he was allowed to enterand without saying a word he marched straightto the governor's bed room who was stillasleep shutting the door he stood erect at thefoot of the bed aroused the governor and saidin a loud voice i am jayme the robber andam answerable for my own deeds you havetaken a poor old woman she was helpless she is innocent you have extorted moneyfrom her you have thrown her into prisonnow hear me the sun has not yet risen ifbefore that sun sets the money is not restoredand the prison doors opened in the grave ihave ordered to be dug for you you shall beburied i am jayme the robber he leftcourage as he had entered unmolested but the governorknew so well the firmness and determinationof jayme that he ordered the moneyto be paid back and the prisoner to be releasedand the circumstances were relatedto me on the spot soon after they occurred this was indeed courage papa v exclaimedarthur was it virtuous courage nodoubt it was arthur for it checked injusticerescued innocence and gave a lesson to thegovernor he would not soon forgets and will you teach us papa how wemay know when courage is really a virtueand when it is not yesv said mr howard i will firstgive you a rule for judging not only of couragebut of every other quality whether or not theyare virtues and then i will mention anotherexample or two in illustration have told you that a coward is not minor moralsnecessarily bad nor a brave man necessarilygood courage like other dispositions maybeapplied to wicked purposes it may beinjurious to the courageous person and injuriousto others if courage make men lesshappy if it expose them to useless risks andannoyances if it injure the comforts or destroythe property of others it is not a virtue butavice guided by prudence and by benevolencecourage is virtuous but if it isnot directed by these it may be quite thecontrary have you heard of sebastian cabot oneof the earliest and most adventurous amongmaritime discoverers in he sailed forsouth america he had only two countrymenwith him and the jealousy of the spanishcaptains immediately under hin broke outinto open disaffection a clamour was raisedamong the crews which menaced not only hiscourage own life but the safety of the whole expeditioncabot was almost a stranger amongthem disliked because a stranger and not lessmisrepresented than disliked mended wassecond in authority rajas and rodas two ofthe captains in command and these three menwere the leaders in that insubordination whichwas on the point of breaking out into mutinycabot's energy and courage were equal to theoccasion he seized on rajas placed himwith mended and rodas in a boat which conveyedthem to shore the eflpect says thehistorian was instants discord vanished andfor five years of service through which theexpedition passed full as they were of toilprivation and peril we hear not the slightestmurmur on the contrary everything indicatesthe most harmonious action and the most devotedfidelity now this was an instancememoirs of cabot p minor moralsof courage this was prudence this was virtueand you will find a thousand such in thehistory of intrepid and virtuous men there is in some of the towns of germanyan institution which exhibits the most exaltedcourage united with the most praiseworthybenevolence at hamburg for example thereare certain men chosen for their known inrapidity whose office it is to rescue humanbeings from dangers to be so chosen isdeemed one of the highest honors that can beconferred by their fellowcitizens they weara peculiar uniform are found in certain stationsof the city and bear the name of menschenbetteror men savers in cases of fire or floodor

alone and the instancescourage of heroic self exposure which i have heard ofshow how much of courageous virtue there isin the world and what an extraordinary powerthe good opinion of our fellows has to exciteit there is not one of these menschenretterwho has not often exposed his own life andoften saved others from destruction evenbefore the honorable title is conferred manyarethe efforts of selfdevotion to obtain itthey have been known to force their waythrough the raging flames and to have rescuedinfants in the highest stories of houses whenthe roof was failing in and after the staircaseshad been consumed it is not long ago thatone of the most distinguished of the menschenbettera celebrated mathematical instrumentmakerat hamburg made a desperate attemptto save a

afterwardsfound it was exposed in the market place tothe grateful gaze of ten thousands of the peopleit was remarked that though the bodywas terribly mutilated the features were scarcelychanged they were calm and serene as ifin sleep the menschenretter had often beenheard to say there are two ways in eitherof which i desire to die in the exerciseof my oflqce or surrounded by my friendsboth wishes may be said to have been fulfilledin one for multitudes of friends witnessed hisheroism and deplored his fate all admiredall wept and they followed him with solemnhymns to his gravehere my boys was courage here wasbenevolence here was virtue v we understand we understand exclaimedarthur and george at the same time youcourage need not tell us now what the courage is thatis not virtue good night lads mamma and edith willbe of our party tomorrowgenerositymrs howard returned the following day accompaniedby miss edith and great was thejoy and great the greeting on their arrival for edith who was a special favorite and anonly sister had been very ill and was nowcome back from a visit to the sea shore whereher health had been improved and she clappedher hands for very joy as she entered the doorsfirst clasping her papa and then her brothersround the neck and then running about wildlyand then coming back again and asking athousand questions and leaping and dancingand forgetting everything but her own happinessand her parents looked at her withsmiles of pleasure and the boys laughed aloudgenerosity at her antics till at last tired out with enjoymentsshe sat herself clown on a stool at hermamma's feet o dear dear v she said what a nice thing it is to be at home again v'it was near the time for school mr howardtook his hat and went out to his business andthe two boys having again kissed their youngsister tripped away lighthearted to theirlessons you said mamma that when we camehome you would talk to me about that generouslittle girl who gave money to all the beggarsas we rode along was it not very kind andvery good i dare say it seemed so to you edith andyet the money which that little girl so carelesslythrew away might have been much better employedbetter employed mamma i thought therecould be no better employment than charity minor moralsby charity i suppose you mean doinggoods love and what if the money so spentinstead of doing good does harm can that possibly be mamma can therebe harm in assisting the poor v there can be no harm in assisting the pooredith if you do them real services but theremay be much harm in acting without any considerationas to the consequences of whatyou dobut are not the consequences the relief oftheir wants mamma and is it not right torelieve them and ought not we to show pitytowards the distressed and to help them asfar as we can we ought my dear to do whatever we cantorelieve and remove distress but in order todoso we must always ask ourselves how we canrelieve it most speedily and most effectuallyand that you may judge for yourself andgenerosity understand my meaning i will tell you thedifference between the person who gives moneyprudently and usefully and the person whodoes not money is given to the poor for therelief of some want but suppose it createsmore wants than it relieves or for the cureof some misfortune now fancy that it producesmore misfortune than it cures certainly itwould be wrong to give the money the wantof prudence and of providence among the poorcannot be provided against unless they suffersomething for their neglect it is often fortheir own interest that they should suffer ifi punish you for a fault it is not because i haveany pleasure in punishing you and seeing yousuffer but because i know unless you are madeto suffer you will not try to correct the faultif a poor person were as well or better off byhis laziness or his drunkenness than he wouldbe by his industry and his temperance he would minor moralshave a stronger motive to do wrong than todoright you must always try to give to peoplereasons or motives for doing right supposeone boy works hard very hard in the fieldsand at the end of the weary day gets sixpencefor his labor and there is another idle beggarboywho gets a shilling without work bymerely asking alms of travellers the bad boywill be twice as well recompensed as thegood boy and every penny you have giventhe bad boy is an encouragement to his idlenessand his beggary i have seen a littlegirl who hunted for mushrooms all the daylong she was then a pattern of neatness andindustry she went into the fields and wasas diligent and as busy as could be and inthe evening if she had earned two or threepenceby the sale of her mushrooms she wasas pleased as possible but one evening whenshe was coming home from her walks andgenerosity very tired indeed she was lie saw a girl ofabout her own age who asked charity from alady in a fine carriage and the lady threwher a shilling and said to her in a very kindtone there poor child upon whichthe little girl who had been used to gatherup pennies and twopences and threepencesby her own industry said to herself whydo i lead this weary life why do i gotrudging away through field and field andafter all can only get a few halfpence for allmy toils and travels i will turn beggar tooand so she did and she lost her good habitsand took to bad ones the clean and diligentchild was no longer to be seen hunting formushrooms in the field she became a practisedbeggar and at last an insolent one andthen grew careless about right and wrong and invented stories about her sufferings thatwere untrue and ended by committing crimesds minor morrisfor which she was transported to a distantland and sorrowful indeed it was to recallthe time of her childhood when she gatheredmushrooms in the green fields nowyou must not think that the lady who gavethe shilling to the beggargirl intended to actamiss she thought she did a generous thingand it was generous to give a shilling to apoor child but it was very mischievous andthus you see that to be generous is not quitethe same as to be wise and goodsmay not money be sometimes generouslyand usefully given asked edith who lookeda little perplexed and who before her mammalessonbegan had been thinking that she wouldspend all her money among the poor beggarswho accosted her edith had indeed beenmuch fascinated by the smiles with which allthe beggars looked upon her generous youngcompanion and thought how very delightful itgenerosity twould he if she could hear addressed to herselfthe same words which had been used to herfellowtraveller god bless you sweet younglady a pleasant journey to you and thankyour goodness but her mother's conversationhad brought many new thoughts into her mindand she therefore timidly inquired whethermoney might not sometimes be generouslyand usefully givenyes indeed love v answered mrs howard and to enable you to give it generously andusefully you must give it prudentlynor was an occasion long wanting fortvhile they were talking a servant came in andsaid that a sad accident had just happened infront of the house a waggonload of timberwas passing and one of the beams not havingbeen carefully fastened had slipped off andhad fallen upon a crippled man who was crossingthe road and was supposed to have done minor moralsmm serious injury mrs howard hastened tothe spot and was followed by edith theysoon found that the poor man's leg was broken we must immediately send for a surgeon'said mrs howard to edith you may begenerous now'and edith saw at once that there had beenno fault on the part of the man and that shecould do no harm to him nor to anybody elseby her liberality so she ran in and despatcheda servant for a surgeon and she asked to beallowed to pay out of her own pocket moneythe expenses of the poor man's curehappy was the evening when the familywere all gathered together edith told herbrothers of the sights she had seen at the seaof the pleasure she had in playing with thewaves how they rushed up the sloping shorebroke into white foam and then ran backagain to meet the advancing tide she toldngenerosity them how the waters rolled the pebbles oneover another till all their sharp points weremade round how she had seen the seagullsfloat on the surface the ships with their whitesails in the distance and the fishermen arrivingwith their boats full of mackerel shining likebright silver and emeralds in the sun shetold them how high the waves rose at thetime of the full moon and how low the neaptidessank how the seabirds flew aloft in thecalm weather and how when the storms werecoming on they hovered close upon the topof the surges and the waves never restsshe said but splash and splash and rise andfall all the night and all the day long as ifthey could never be tired but i must tell you arthur of the accidentwe have had today and thougharthur had heard it all from the servants onhis return from school he let the talkative minor moralslittle girl rattle on and recount in her ownway the story of the poor man whose leg hadbeen brokenshe said nothing however of the part shehad taken in the business nothing of her owngood deeds nothing even of the conversationwith her mamma about liberality and charitysand don't you think edith said mrshoward to her that you could now explainthe difference between generosity and truegoodness edith blushed and answered ihave been thinking mamma that generosityis very like the jackdaw in the fable struttingabout in borrowed feathers and making a greatclatter about merits that are not its own intolerance there was a very droll dispute at schooltoday papa v said george one boy insistedthat a latin verse was written one way in theoriginal another declared it was written anotherway the quarrel became so hot that we expectedit would have ended in blows whenone of the bigger boys recommended that eachshould bring his book and it was found thateach had quoted the passage correctly fromhis own copy but they had different editionsand the text was diflferentit was said mr howard only a smalldisplay of that intolerance of which there aretoo many great exhibitions in the worldeach boy thought himself right and had minor moralsgood reason for thinking so but there wasnot the same reason for thinking the otherwrong he had seen his own book with hisown eyes and had therefore very sufficientevidence for himself but he could not knowwhat evidence the other had had hence thefolly of expecting everybody to think as wethink they will think as we think if thesame reasons are given to them and if thosereasons influence them as they influence usif they have other reasons unknown to us orif our reasons appear to them not to warrantour opinions they cannot think as wethink it is impossible and there is no helpfor itbut what ought to be helped and oidght tobe avoided is our attempting to punish othersbecause they do not see as we see or thinkas we think this is persecutionwhen i was in lisbon i was accompaniedintolerance by a monk to the cliurcli of st anthony youhave heard perhaps that the armorial bearingsof that beautifullysituated city are a vesseldismasted but guided through the waters bytwo crows one seated on the prow and theother on the stern of the ship the deviceis in honor of a miracle said to have beenwrought in favour of st anthony the patronsaint of the tagus who when at sea sailingon a mission to the heathen fancied himselflost for all the crew of the vessel in whichhe sailed had perished of plague and he wasleft wholly ignorant of navigation to themercy of the waves in his despair he kneltdown to pray when he saw two blackpinionedbirds descend from heaven one of which seizedthe rudder and the other perched on the bowof the ship by these he was safely conductedto portugal and among the majority of theportuguese there is no more doubt of the minor moralsmiracle than of the ordinary events of whichthey have been witnesses themselves'did you believe the story papa inquirededithby no means and though i never saidanything which should show that i felt contemptfor the credulity of the portuguese yeti have no doubt they considered me somewhatheretical come said the monk come with me tothe tgreja de sao antonio and i will give yousuch evidence as shall be irresistible wewalked together under the magnificent archesof the church between avenues of pillars onmany of which the miracles of the saint wererecorded and we reached a narrow staircase atthe foot of the tower follow mess said themonki and fear notes i ascended after him thelong longwinding stone steps the darkness ofthe way being only lighted by distant gleamsintolerance which broke through the narrow intersticesleft in the thick walls and on reaching thetop the monk pointed out a huge cage itwas as large as an ordinary sized room inwhich were two enormous black crows gravelyseatedon a metal bar look there seniorssaid the monk and bowed his head reverentlybefore the crows those are the identical birdswhich brought st anthony hither and doyou doubt the miracle now i doubted and did not doubt the less inconsequenceof what i saw and why did idoubt edith t suppose papa because you did not thinkthey were the real crows that brought stanthony to lisbon even so my love and i did not believethat st anthony had been brought to lisbonby crows at all and the attempt to convince minor moralsme that the two crows were still living andhad lived for many hundreds of years was onedifficulty more to believe and not one difficultylessthe menes reasoning was what logicianscall begging the questions he took forgranted the very thing to be proved that stanthony had been escorted by the crows andthen fancied that his telling me the crows isaw were the real crows was to weigh downall my experience of the habits of the animalall my knowledge of natural history and thevery natural reflection that it was much morelikely there should be a succession of crowsprovided by the monk and his brethren as theold ones died than that a perpetual miracleshould be wrought in order to prove the truthof a very improbable story besides i sawthat the crows were richly and regularly fedintolerance and i might have asked him why if the crowswere miraculously preserved all the expensesof nourishing them were not saved and did you not tell him papa that youcould look through the whole of the imposturev said george did you not tell himthat he was a rogue and that you were notto be duped by his roguery softly my impatient boy that wouldneither have been prudent nor courteous itwould have done neither me nor him noranybody any good no good to me for ishould have been exposed to some danger themonk would have looked upon me with hatredbecause my expression of incredulity wouldhave implied contempt for his opinions ordistrust of his honesty and veracity it wouldhave done him no good for it was his interestto persist in the fraud and as to the fads ofthe case he knew more about them than i minor moralsdid and no good to anybody else for nobodyelse was present but it may do good nowto you and to others for to others you maytell the story as i may tell it to others my purpose in telling the story was notto excite your scorn or dislike towards themonk who though h could not believeagainst the knowledge he had that those identicalcrows really escorted st anthony up thetagus may have believed that st anthonyleas escorted by crows i did not wish youto be angry with the monk or the monk'stale but i wished to ask you two questionsif i had really desired and tried to believethe story coidd i have done so in spite ofmyself no indeed papa that would have beenimpossible said all the children at once you would not have been so foolish and if i could not have believed it evenintolerance though i wished to believe it could i do sobecause the monk or any other person wishedme to believe it y oh no no they all repeated again andagainswell then my children the lesson iwished to teach you is this never be angrywith any person merely because his opinionis not your opinion never be angry becauseyou cannot persuade him to change his opinionand above all never do him an injury orhesitate about doing him a good because hisopinions and yours are different nobody canbelieve what he likes however he may try todoso at all events if he hears all that is tobe said on all sides of a question still lesscan anybody believe according to the likingsof others where you doubt inquire inyour own opinions seek nothing but truthbecause truth after all is the great thing in minor moralsyour conduct to others be guided by the rulethat you should never cause useless pain inthe minds of the best men there is alwayshas been and always perhaps will be muchdifference of opinion as to what is true buteverybody knows and feels what is mnd andtruth itself is most likely to be found whenit is sought for by tolerance and benevolenceadvicegiving i canst understand plato papa his finewords are without meaning to my minds saidgeorge he says that all truth and scienceis in recollection but we can only recollectwhat we know and you papa have alwaystaught us to observe and to inquire and togather up knowledge from all around us butplato says all knowledge is in ourselves doyou think the ancient philosophers understoodthe science of morals as well as the moderns assuredly not answered mr howard we have the experience of many generationsto add to their experience plato lived at aperiod when it was the fashion to treat thee minor moralsgreat majority of human beings with contempthe owns that his morality was not intendedfor universal use it was too sublime for thosewhom he called the vulgar but christianityteaches us to regard all men as our brethrenand no system of morality can be really goodwhich is not fitted for mankind in those days the many were slaves to thefew and as was natural the few treated themany with scorn and insolence they calledthem a base and unlettered herd and seemedto consider them as belonging to a differentrace they were indeed in many respectsworse off than the poor blacks in the westindia islands nothing gives a meaner notionof the doctrines of what is denominated theacademic school than their carelessness aboutthe happiness of all but themselves and thecontumelious manner in which they put forththeir opinionsadvicegiving to give advice to others prudently andbenevolently is one of the lessons i wouldhave my children learn on this subject thereare among the distichs of cato some veryadmirable counsels which i should like themto commit to their memory and they will serveto illustrate what i have to saysubmit thy tongue to virtue's disciplinefor welljudged silence is a gift divinetherefore do not intrude advice unless youaire sure it will be useful if it is likely toirritate and do not improve the person towhom it is addressed restrain yourself fromgiving it your silence in such case will bea welljudged silence give no advice which is injurious toyourself this also is the counsel of cato virtute primam esse put compeers linguaproxies ille neo est qui sit ratione facere minor moralsinjuring thyself if others thou condemnwell may they deem that thou wilt injure themand a serious injury to yourself it will beif you give advice that is illtimed intrusiveor unbecoming advicegiving assumes superiorityand the right to give it must onlybe used where the good to be done is undoubtedif you give advice give it benevolentlydo

to us every day what a perpetual contribution of valuabletopics for reflection does a newspaper bring of how many countries it speaks how manyoccurrences it records how far it travels insearch of

would like to hear forpresence of mind though a gift of nature tosome may be strengthened by habit and encouragedby example it is prompt prudentialcourage providing the best safeguards in themoment of peril it does not seek dangersunnecessarily for that would be folly butif dangers arrive it is ready with the bestmeans for averting them timidity that flieswithout inquiring what ought to be done bothconfuses and debilitates the mind i wouldnot have my children foolhardy nor presumptuousbut i would have them considerate and presence of mind s one of the goodpresence of mind qualities in which i hope they will not bewantingbut i must give you the newspaperaccount the life of the right honorableedward ellice and perhaps of several other personswas saved the other day by the presenceof mind displayed by his sen a youth underagea fire broke out and was making greatprogress it had nearly reached the apartmentsin which were mr ellice and his son in acloset close to the room was a large canisterof gunpowder sufficient to have blown up thewhole edifice without mentioning his intentionto anybody the young ellice hastenedto the closet got hold of the canister andflung it out of window a few moments ofdelay or forgetfulness might have led to thedestruction of the edifice and of every bodyin it now which of you children canremember an instance of presence of mind v minor moralssoh papas said edith i recollect thestory of the gentleman who was saved by hispresence of mind when the madman got holdof him in bedlamite well then let ns hear it for to repeat astory to others is the yqvj best way ofremembering it yourselfwell papa there was a party of gentlemenand ladies who went to visit bedlamand as they averse going through the wardsone of the gentlemen was accosted by aperson whom he supposed to be one of thekeepers and who said to him in a whisper your friends are only going through the commonparts of the establishment but if youwill come with me i will show you theapartments which are not generally openedto strangers the man went off and beckonedto the gentleman who stepped awayfrom his companions to follow his new guidepresence of mind who led lii through sundry passages to thetop of the building and then out upon theleads no sooner were they there than theman said to the gentleman now sir jumpinto the street v you may suppose whatwere his feelings when he found himself inthe presence of a madman and knew that themadman's next step would probably be tothrow him off the building but his presenceof mind suggested a means of escape and hesaid to the madman jump down anybodycan jump down but if you'll let me i'll godown and jump up which will be muchmore of a feats the madman burst into alaugh ha ha indeed it will march downand try so the gentleman was allowed togo and naturally the first thing he did wasto inform the keepers of the narrow escapehe had had and to urge them to be a littlemore careful in future that such a dangerous minor moralslunatic should not be allowed to put people'slives in jeopardy and now george let ushear your story will tell you then of an example ofpresence of mind which i have somewhereread of in ancient time do you rememberthe story of that philosopher when alexanderof macedonia had menaced with destruction acity of asia that had refused to pay himtribute who was sent forth to entreat theconqueror's clemency he had been alexander'stutor and he was employed to interferein the earnest hope that from his formerinfluence with the conqueror he would notintercede in vain but alexander seeing himapproach and knowing the object of his comingcalled out don't trouble yourself ormei vow to you and i have sworn a solemnoath to all the gods that i will never grantyour request on which the philosopher saidpresence or mind i humbly entreat your majesty to reducethe city to ashes and to let no one of itsinhabitants escape alexander perplexed itis said by the solemnity of his vow desistedfrom injuring the city or punishing the citizensnow arthur it is your turn i hardly know papa said arthur whetherthe conduct of herman cortes when hedestroyed his whole fleet which robertsoncalls san effort of magnanimity unparalleledin history should be considered as most remarkablefor courage or for presence of mindremarkable for both said mr howard and now let me hear what you recollect ofthe history while cortes was making arrangementsfor advancing the conquest of mexico bysending an envoy to spain in order to communicatewith the spanish court on mattersof extreme urgency a plot was formed tos minoe moralsseize one of the vessels and to intercept themessenger on his way homewards and thusto thwart all cortes's plans and supersede himin his command one of the conspirators communicatedthe purpose to cortes a few hoursbefore the intended departure cortes instantlywent on board and found the conspiratorsall assembled and about to sail intimidatedby his sudden appearance they neitherdenied nor attempted to justify their treasonthey were all arrested the leaders executedthe subordinates forgiven because says thespanish historian he was so careful of thelives of his men and mingled kindness withhis severest justice yet he felt that thisattempt to undermine his authority was butasystem of feelings which might again breakout and that he could not rely on the chancesof fortune in the discovery of any future plotsagainst him he determined with a readingof mind ness and a boldness far beyond ordinary experienceto identify his followers with his ownfate and to cut off all means of retreat andof return to spain he determined to sacrificethe whole of his fleet leaving nothingto the choice of his comrades but success orinevitable destruction to a few of the mostfaithful of his friends he communicated hisplans the sailors were won over by presents andpromises to declare that the ships were nolonger sea worthy the soldiers were inducedto believe that the accession of the seamento their body would be a most important andvaluable addition to their forces cortesenergetic purpose carried him through hisbold design the vessels were dismantledand sunk and he now stood at the head ofhis band with nothing before him but conquestor a grave and he succeededvery wells said mr howard bravely minor moralstold but it is not very likely any of us shouldhave an opportunity of showing presence ofmind on so grand an occasion but occasionsare of frequent occurrence i know a lady wellandyou know her whose infant child had toundergo a dangerous and most painful operationit was the removal of a great portion of thebaby's cheek and she knew that her presencewould comfort the child as far as it could becomforted and determined so to master hersympathies as to be most useful yet she wasremarkable for tenderness towards her childrenand would not for the world have inflicted onthem a needless pain i remember well thatthe surgeon looked at her with some surprisebut his doubts as to the propriety of herpresence were removed by the calmness andfirmness with which she insisted she held thebabe during the operation and if any thingwould have assuaged his terrors or lightened hispresence op mind lsufferings it would have been his motherswatchfulness and care i am sure that at thecost of some present pain she purchased a storeof future pleasure for herself and futuregratitude from her boy and that as i have oftentold you is the arithmetic of virtue whichincreases happiness always or at leastdiminishes sufferingin very early life i have seen presence ofmind exhibited usefully and thoughtfullyexhibited i was once travelling in the mailcoach with a little boy a very little boy for acompanion and when we were getting into thevehicle he asked me what would happen if wewere overturned i told him that what wouldhappen i did not know perhaps we should getour bones broken but at all events the wayto run the least risk was to be calm and quietand to sit as firmly as possible in the seat itdid so chance that the mail was overturned my minor moralslittle man was as grave and as steady as aphilosopher and when i had dragged him outof the window and set him upon his legs hesaid very solemnly papa i have severalbones broken but happily though severalpassengers were seriously bruised and injuredno mischief whatever befell the little thoughtfulboy and now i think we have had examplesenough both among the little and the great ofthe virtue of presence of mind and you willnot forget that its value depends wholly on thegood which is done or the suffering that isprevented by it but as nobody knows whenthe opportunities for exercising it may happenand as those opportunities may be of thegreatest importance endeavor to form the habitof selfcontrol be ready to do promptly whatis best to be done in the calm hour when nointerruptions break in upon the thoughts fancypresence of mind circumstances that require a speedy decisionfrom you if you hear of mistakes or vexationsfrom the want of presence of mind in othersemploy your own mind in thinking how soitwould have prevented them make the errorsof others useful as beacons to warn you awaymake their wisdom useful as magnets toattract and guide youhumanity to animalsin the evenings mr howard was reading shakspeareto the assembled circle and when hecame to that celebrated passage and the poor beetle that we tread uponin corporal suffering feels a pang as greatas when a giant dies is that true papa v interrupted arthur nos indeed answered mr howard puttingdown the book it is poetry and not truth it is the exaggeration of a benevolent feelingsstrongly and beautifully put but it will notbear a very close examination what howeverought not to be forgotten isj that insectshowever small and seemingly contemptiblehave feelings both of pain and pleasure andhumanity to animals those feelings ought not to be thoughtlesslywounded i would not number on my list of friendswho heedlessly sets foot upon a worm for though the worm's enjoyments and sufferingsmay be small compared to those of humanbeings they are enjoyments they are sufferingsand therefore are very worthy of ourregard to increase those enjoyments isvirtue to diminish them is vice to lessenthose sufferings is virtue and it is vice toaugment themsome people think of humanity to animalsas a sort of condescending virtue for whichthe animals ought to be very much obligedit is however to be judged of by the samerule as every other virtue and depends uponthe pains and pleasures to which animals aresubject and of which they are susceptiblecould they feel as much as human beings they minor moralswould be intitled to just the same quantity ofour benevolence they administer to our pleasuresand thus they have a hold upon ourgood will many of them can make a gratefulreturn for our kindness to them and so againwe have a motive for using them kindly andwe may add to their happiness and as far aswe can do so we exercise benevolence aman who treats the animals that depend uponhim with unnecessary harshness or cruelty isa very bad moralist in practice thousandsof persons especially among the poor whocannot do much for the increase of the happinessof mankind have beasts of burthen orother animals subjected to them whose livesthey may make wretched by their severityor comfortable by their friendly acts in halfcivilizedlife it often happens that more ofbenevolence is exhibited to the brute creationthan among us the affection of an arab forhumanity to animals his

again and againspoken of and i confess that in visiting thatstrange and gigantic animal the cameleopardor giraffe in the garden of plants at parisi was nearly as much interested by the coalblacknubian slave who waited upon him asby the splendid creature himself so attentive minor moralsdid he seem to his charge so proud of itsmajesty its docility its beauty its fame he appeared to me a most important portionof the whole effect and created round the talland gentle creature a sort of natural anddomestic atmosphere there was a realbrotherhood between them and i thought ifeither were to die how lonely and desolate thesurvivor would be the greatest philosopher of our days theman whose mind was beyond comparison themost exalted and whose benevolent affectionsthe most expansive that i have ever beenprivileged to know was himself a striking exampleof the powers of sympathy towards theanimal creation he felt for all that hadfeeling and was habitually showing thoughnot intrusively how much he felt i haveknown the mice run up and down his legsas he was engaged in the profoundest studies humanity to animals making their way to a drawer under his deskwhere he was accustomed to keep

did not live to receivethis new mark of distinction from the stateauthorities he died during the discussion fullof years and was buried amidst the real regretsand respectful remembrances of all who hadhad the privilege of his acquaintance animals by no means occupy that place inour affection and our regards to which they areintitled we hardly know how much theymight learn if they were properly taughtthey are far more improbable beings thanwe generally suppose them to be and theywould many of them become apt and intellig minor moralsgent scholars if trouble were taken to instructthem those which add most to man's enjoymentsand therefore obtain most of his attentionshow great docility and by care andkindness sometimes mingled with discipline for animals must be dealt with like men

antics and i could not fancythat they were not in some way tied so thattheir master could guide their motions but no they were all free and they flew away andreturned as they were bidden they

themin their sleeves and their bosoms i love the child that loves animals sometimeago when i was on the banks of thegaronne a little french boy ran to me with atumbler turned upside down on a plate wherethere was some water and some fresh leavessaying see what a pretty thing i have got totell me what the weather will be it was avery small frog with a back as green asemeralds a belly as yellow as gold and eyesas bright as diamonds i keep him heressaid the little boy and when it is going to bebad weather he goes and hides himself in thewater under the leaves and when it is goingto be fine he comes out and clambers to thetop of the glass and then i know i can go andplay in the fields had the little boy taught him to do sospapa v inquired edith minor moralsno my love there is an almost universalinstinct among animals by wliicli they areenabled to anticipate the changes of the seasonsand it enables them to make provision for thesechanges but i have heard of frogs that camewhen they were called and i have heard ofchildren who had need to be taught even thatnow what say you young people shallwe open a school for animals voh yes yes they all cried out togetherwell then said mr howard each oneshall choose a pupil and tell us how it is to bebrought upoh v said edith i will have a prettywhite mouse such as i have seen the savoyardboys showing about with rosecolored eyes andears and tail so transparent that you can almostsee through them and i will teach it to threadmy needles and to do my errands and it shallsit by the side of my plate at dinner and onhumanity to animals smy lap in the evenings when you papa aretelling us your pretty stories and i will teachit to wake me in the morning and it shall gowith me to my dancing lessons and then wheni am alone i can dance a duet with itupon which a loud laugh from all the reststopped the talkative little girl and georgesaid oh edith you began with a mouseand end with a hull but now what doesarthur say i should likes said arthur a lion'scub for what a fine thing it would be to teachit and to tame it and when it became a fullgrownlion what a pride to be accompaniedby such a noble creature and to go into thewoods to hunt with it i am afraid said mr howard thatarthur's first experiment is somewhat toodaring and that he would be very soon desirousof changing his lion for a more docile pupil's minor morals i should like papa i think said george to try what i could do with a goodnaturedhare and then i would turn to account theexperience of the poet cowper who certainlydid manage to get the friendship of one hareat least and to get a friend papa is worth alittle troublenow suppose you were each of you lefton an uninhabited island and were to chooseone animal for your companion what shouldit be a lamb for me said edith that wouldbe the best companion for it is never in apassion we could enjoy ourselves togetherin the fields by day and it would keep mewarm at night and its wool would be so useful and it would not be coaxed away to leave meby any wild creaturesi think i should choose said arthur awelltrained falcon for he would go forth andhumanity to animals catch me food and find food for himself withoutany anxiety for me and he might decoy othercreatures and there is something so cheerfulin the flight of a bird that it would keep upmy spirits in solitude i said george hardly know what tofix upon but i vote for the llama of the andeswhich is strong enough to carry burthenswhich would give me milk and wool which ishould learn to weave into garments andwhat does mamma say mamma says mrs howard answeredthat sie should prefer a dog for a companion because she knows more about its good qualitiesand its docility and its patience and itscourage a biography of dogs and of theirvirtuous deeds would fill many volumes theylive in all climates and of all the companionsof man are the most attached and faithful idon't think i should dismiss mv old favorite for minor moralsthe sake of a stranger of whose excellencies ishould not feel quite so sure amen said mr howard and nowchildren away to your dreams'they went and before sleep george arthurand edith said to themselves and to oneanother that they had never liked animals sowell before and never thought of all the usesthat might be made of themveracitythe next day they all met at the breakfasttableand the subject they talked about wastruth george and edith had a strong senseof its value but arthur now and then notbecause he meant to prevaricate or utter falsehoodbut generally from mere precipitancyand carelessness was used to speak with inaccuracyabout matters so it frequently happenedthat he underwent those crossquestioningswhich nobody ever thought of employing withedith or george if george erred it wasby too much reserve while the error of arthurwas on the side of inconsiderateness littleedith was all ingenuousness and prattle shenever thought of concealing anything and the minoe moralsidea of misrepresentation never entered hermind in fact mr and mrs howard wereso desirous of establishing habits of veracityamongst their children that no known misstatementhad ever gone unpunished and thefrank avowal even of a fault was sure to beaccepted as a peaceoffering for half its ordinarypenaltieswhat led to the conversation was this mr howard had inquired of george whatlessons they had to prepare for school andgeorge answered our greek exercise ourlatin verses and our three problems in euclidpapas and are you ready yes repliedhe upon which mr howard said iwill hear you your latin verses and trust toyour word for the rest and george repeatedthem perfectly well mr howard soon aftermet arthur and not telling him that he hadseen george he asked him what were hisveracity tasks for the clay arthur hesitated andsaid latin verses and euclid for in truthhe had not learnt his greek lesson and wasafraid his father would inquire about it andreprove him for his negligence upon whichhis father looked him full in the face andsaid arthur is that all and arthur'scheeks became red and fiery he felt he hadmeant to conceal a part of the truth and bitterwere the selfreproaches he felt his papaadmonished him in gentle terms arthuryou have given yourself much pain you havegiven me much pain i trust what you sufferand i suffer will be enough to prevent youfrom giving way again to this sad infirmityof yours truth then was the breakfasttable topicbut mr howard made no reference whateverto arthur s fault hoping and believing thathe had suffered enough for present correction minor moralsand the art of punishment is to inflict no moremisery than is necessary to produce reformationarthur had suffered humiliation his papawished to spare him the additional humiliationof having his weakness exposed to his mammahis brother and his sister it would havegrieved all of them and mr howard wouldnot grieve them needlessly it would havebeen as cruel for him to inflict useless sorrowto help a moral cure as for the surgicaloperator to make an unnecessary incision inthe limbs of the patient he was endeavoringto healbut mr howard thought the opportunityshould not be lost of enforcing the importanceof veracity he read from the newspaper theaccount of the crossexamination of a prevaricatingwitness how sad it is he remarked that the solemnity and importanceof a judicial proceeding are not a sufficientveracity security for the utterance of truth nowgeorge tell me what you think of a storyi will relate to youa wellknown portuguese courtier domduarte pereyra

thejudge recalled to his mind that he had madethe same statement ten years before he answered please your highness you cannothave a better proof of my veracity for t alwayssay the same thing indeed papa it seems an occasion veryill chosen for a display of wit and levity atthe expense of truth if the auditory laughedat the joke they could have little respect forthe jokertrue george and if pereyra had not minor moralsbeen a courtier and a powerful man theprobability is be would have been severelypunished for contempt of the courtsthere is a proverbs said george thattruth is not to be spoken at all times canyou give us some rules papa by which wemay know when truth is to be spoken andwhen not tthe proverb you have quoted may bemade a mischievous one j it has a bad and agood meaning its bad meaning is that falsehoodmay sometimes be spoken its goodmeaning is that it is not always incumbenton us to speak at all the general rule isthat whatever is spoken should be true butit is not all truth that is useful useful truthsshould be spoken pernicious truths should besuppressed you might annoy everybody youmeet by the utterance of truth but its beingtruth would be no justification truth likeveracity everything else is a means to an end andany one might make himself as vexatious bythe utterance of illtimed truths as by theutterance of the boldest falsehoods i knewa man whose pride it was to tell people whathe called the truth that man was an absolutenuisance and avoided by everybodyhe scarcely ever opened his lips but to makeothers unhappy and he thought this habitvery frank and meritorious he would nothave told a lie for the world but he producedmore unhappiness than many a liar he wasalways on the lookout for occasions to saytrue and disagreeable things the more truethe more disagreeable and he flattered himselfwith the thought that he was a fine exampleof moral courage aud virtuetar different was the conduct of a trulybenevolent friend of mine his rule withvery rare exceptions was never to utter ah minor moralsword never to do a deed which should givepain to another if it were absolutely necessaryto say anything which caused pain hemade the pain as little as possible by thegentleness and kindness of his manner heseldom uttered paingiving truths paingivingfalsehoods never prudence and benevolence take veracityunder their care to violate truth is to losereputation and this is imprudent wheneverby a violation of truths injury is done toothers the virtue of benevolence is violatedno falsehood can be uttered without somemischief to the mind and the case whichwould justify falsehood by producing a resultof good is so rare that a man must be quitesure it will warrant the sacrifice of a portionof his reputationthere is no virtue which obtains for itspossessors a larger portion of good opinion inveracity early life than the love of truth virtue mjchildren consists in the sacrifice of some presentenjoyment to a future greater good andtruthtelling often subjects us to great temporaryinconvenience sometimes to considerablesuffering which if we undergo for thesake of truth is evidence of a virtuous dispositionand of a determination to acquire avirtuous habit three boys john thomas and henrywere playing in a field and saw withoutbeing perceived a man who had been verykind to them misuse and rob another manthey were not near enough to interfere butthey were near enough to witness all thecircumstances of the case the robber havingquitted his victim passed close to theplace where the boys were and at once discoveredthat they had been spectators of hiscrime and that perhaps his life was in the minor moralshands of those very boys whose benefactorhe had been he was too much hurried tostop but as he went on he said to the boys'you won betray me the man whohad been robbed having got assistance therobber was arrested and the three boys havingbeen found so near the scene of therobbery were carried before the magistrateto be interrogated as to what they knew ofthe affair they were separately examined in john'smind the desire to save his friend and benefactormastered every other feeling hewould rather have told the truth if he couldhave done so without danger to the robberbut while he was questioning his own mindas to what he ought to do the robberswords rushed upon his thoughts you willnot betray me and he said to himself no i will not betray you come what willsveracity sos then he was questioned he denied allknowledge of the robbery denied that hehad seen either the robber or the person robbedand did this with a pertinacity whichno doubt he thought heroic and which wentfar in the mind of the magistrate to shakehis faith in the story of the robbed manthomas's struggle with himself was yetseverer he could not determine to tell afalsehood nor could he determine to giveevidence against his friend he feared tooin his anxiety not to appear a liar on theone hand or a betrayer on the other thathe might be caught in prevarication or thathis statements might not be corroborated bythose of john and henry his first thoughtwas to escape and hide himself but findingthis impossible he feigned dumbness he preservedan obstinate silence and nothing that minor moralsthe magistrate was able to say could extorta word from himhenry too had some difficulty in decidinghow to act but the claims of truthespecially on so solemn an occasion at lastgot the mastery he weighed the consequencesas well as he was able and hisconscience told him that his own honor andthe good of society ought to outweigh theclaims of the robber upon his silence hestated the facts simply truly though it wasobvious how much he suffered tell me said mr howard which ofthe boys acted most meritoriously they alldecided against john george and edith tookhenry's part but arthur seemed to thinkthat thomas had after all behaved mostnobly that he had not violated truth andhad exhibited proper gratitude to his benefactorveracity no replied mr howard the mischiefof falsehood may on some occasions be equallyproduced by insincerity in other shapes thedifference between john and thomas wasmerely this that john was the more rashlyimprudent of the two the claim of societyupon each of the boys in a case where thejust laws of society had been so violently outragedwas stronger than any claim of gratitudecould be in cases of doubt decide infavor of veracity and sincerity for as anancient writer has said of truth it enduresand is stronger than all things praise and blameas george and arthur were returning homefrom school they saw a crowd gathered rounda preacher whose loud voice caused manypassengers to tarry and listen he had madea pulpit of a chair which he had borrowedat a neighboring house and was exerting himselfviolently in order to excite attentionsome persons stopped for curiosity some outof respect for the preachers zeal some tomake jokes while others passed heedlesslyor scornfully by george and arthur fell inwith the crowd and they were much struckby the variety of opinions they heard expressedgne person said he is very intemperatebut perhaps he is acting under a sensepraise and blame of religious duty another said did youever see such an exhibition of fanaticism while a poor woman whispered to a verysoberlooking man who was listening withgreat reverence and attention he must beagood man to bear with so much patiencethe taunts of these worldlyminded sinnersthe preacher continued his discourseamidst all the annoyances and discouragementsaround one person cried out come downold hypocrite from your preachingtub andhe was answered by another's reproof howcan you be so profane v the law ought tostop such superstitious frenzy said one the law ought to protect him from suchimproper interruptions answered another allthis set the boys meditating on the differentjudgments formed of the same action andthey told mr howard when they came homehow much they had been entertained by the minor moralsdissimilarity of the opinions they had heardand how much they were embarrassed by theopposing sentiments that had been expressedone of the most important lessons tolearn said mr howard ais to judge ofthings apart from the language of praise orblame there are three ways of speakingof every action of menes lives one in approvalone in disapproval and one which conveysno opinion as to merit or demerit fewthings have done the world so much injuryas the custom of attaching words of reproachor words of eulogy to every thing said ordone by another in this way every eventbecomes distorted by prejudiced or passionatejudgment the same act will be called bydifferent persons prudence economy parsimonyor covetousness another act will bedenominated by one man desire of informationj by another inquisitiveness by a thirdpraise and blame curiosity j by a fourth impertinence whatone person calls laudable pride another willcall ostentation and a third arrogance sointhe case you have been mentioning thepreachers conduct was subjected to every titlethat could be found for it from piety and godlinesson the one side to superstition hypocrisyand fanaticism on the other the simple truthbeing only that he was preaching in the street all the rest was the addition of despotic opinionssitting in judgment on his conduct one of the great things then to learn isto weigh the merit of an action apart from thephrases in which others speak of it theworst of actions are sometimes praised the bestof actions are sometimes condemned accustomyourselves always to inquire into the consequencesof conduct which you may study inthe pains and pleasures it produces never seekthe causes of conduct in motives which you minor moralscannot discover which nobody can discover foras hudibras quaintly says nature has made man's breast no windowsto publish what he does within doorsall motives are the same in intention novoluntary action is done from any other thanfrom a desire to do it a desire is created bythe presence or the hope of pleasure or bythe hope of escape from pain a man robshis neighbor he thinks he shall have morepleasure from the possession of the articles hesteals than he shall lose by the consequences ofthe robbery having the same opportunityanother man does not rob his neighborwhy because he would have less pleasurein robbing him than he has in refraining aman tells a lie and wherefore becausehe thinks it is his interest to do so anotherunder the same circumstances tells the truth but solely because in his view of the case itpraise and blame is his interest to tell the truth the motive isthe same always but the determination thatprompts to the virtuous action has made a wisecalculation of pleasure and the opposite determinationhas made a foolish calculationas you advance in life you will often hearlanguage the effect of which and often the intentionof which is to conceal the true characterof actions intemperance will take the nameof sociability or conviviality antipathyof public spirit maleficence of patriotismand widespreading mischief of fame andglory but if you accustom yourselves to lookto the influence of actions upon human happinessupon your own happiness and that ofothers you never will be at a loss no fictionsor fallacies will bewilder or betray youdid you not observe today that thestrongest and most passionate language washeld by those who were most excited and thus minor moralsthe least able to judge if there were anyin the crowd who looked on calmly andexpressed their opinion quietly i am sure youmust have thought them the most worthy ofbeing listened to and so it is and so it willever be in life a serene state of mind is thebest fitted for honest judgmentonce it was a beautiful morning in springa

was not less kind not less useful tothe rough ferns and prickly gorse than tothe flowers of the valley and the trees of thewood j but they received its visit in a differentspirit and so will it be in the world praiseand blame will not be apportioned according topraise and blame the merit of actions but according to thetempers of individuals the virtuous are farmore willing to praise than to blame they neverblame unnecessarily and they delight to praisejudge rightly my children wherever you can but always judge benevolently you cannot besure that you will not fall into mistakes butyou may be sure that you will not fall into themistakes of malevolence which are the worstof allemployment of timei will give joxxy my children's said mrhoward an account of a happy man andwhat do you think was the principal cause ofhis happiness it was the wise employmentof his time time must be employed eitherin doing what is useful or what is not for thetime that is not usefully is uselessly employedand all the time employed uselessly is employedbadly did time ever hang heavy en yourhands if it did you have much to learn inorder to be happy for the wise man and thehappy man have no idle time time is thematerial out of which pleasure is made and hewho makes most pleasures out of it is theman who employs it bestemployment of time what are you thinking about arthursaid mr howard who observed that arthur wasalmost bursting with a desire to speaknothing papa said arthur oh yes i was thinking that if i had nothing to do butto look about for pleasures i should be a veryhappy fellow well then and how would you employyourself arthur in the first place i would have plenty ofholidays and plenty of sportand plenty of vexation arthur from nothaving learnt as much as other boys of youragebut i would buy myself all sorts of delicaciesand buy sickness and headashes withthem said his fatherso arthur was a little abashed and began toblush and said i was too hasty papa and minor moralsbefore i run away after pleasures i will think a little more about it'and edith said i fancy t understand youpapa nobody can be happy unless he ispleased at something but it is not every pleasurethat makes happinessthat is my meaning love happiness ismade up of pleasures but the best of pleasuresare those which do not bring any pain afterthem it would be a bad bargain if you wereto borrow a penny today and have to pay ashilling tomorrow for the loan of it yet thatis exactly what people do who never think ofthe consequences of a pleasure do you recollectwhen you were a little girl how youate the twelfth cake in excess and how yonsuffered for it and took disagreeable medicineand felt so wretched and made us all souncomfortable about you when you ate thecake it was the pennyworth of pleasure foremployment of time llwhich you were obliged to pay a shillingsworthof paini remember it well papa and i won'tmake so foolish a mistake against but i was going to show you how muchhappiness or how many pleasures rather ofwhich happiness is made depend upon thejudicious use of time time is our greattreasure and should be dealt with as a treasure part with it as with money sparing payno moment but in purchase of its worthexcept when you are suffering bodily or mentalpain there is no moment that you may notmake useful or pleasurablebut tell us how papa the children alldemandedby employing it

saywas the daily business of his life he wasnot used to look upon a criminal with anyfeeling other than that of benevolence heknew how much poverty and ignorance hadto do with the offences which the laws proscribeto punish for the sake of punishmentfor the sake of retaliation and revenge seemedto him folly and wickedness his constantinquiry was how the penalties of crime couldbe safely diminished how the infliction of unnecessarypain could be avoided he thoughtthe prisoner worthy of all the care and all theinstruction likely to amend him and to relieve minor moralssociety from the repetition

countriesflowers are associated with death because theyare striking images of the transitoriness of lifeand are so meek and lovely and suited tothe melancholy thoughts of the grave oneof the sights

warriorand had received from him that great objectof a frenchman's ambition the cross of thelegion of honor he went with the grandarmy to the russian campaign no tidingswere ever heard of him and it was supposedhe perished among the tens of thousands whodied in misery and of whom no history tellshis poor wife was told of the ice and thesnow and the freezing of the soldiers andthe burning of towns and the murders oflove of flowers the cossacks lie heard that regiments hadperished but of him for whom she cared morethan for all the world besides she could getno tidings yet she dared not think he haddied she dreamed and dreamed and dreamedagain that he had been preserved in the midstof the desolation often did he appear to herin her sleep and often in the morning didshe say perhaps he may come before theevening but he came not how should hecome he had been frozen to death on thesteppes of russia so by degrees the soldiers widow beganto say to herself there is no hope nevernever shall we meet again she had onechild whose name was mathilde and withher she was accustomed to talk of her fatherand of the happy time when they lived togetherthe girl was eight years old andrecollected little of her sire she thought she minor moralshad seen some one in a smart blue dresswearing a high cap who used to smile uponher and kiss her but her remembrance wasindistinct and she doubted whether she shouldknow him again were he to return yet sometimesshe had a faint memory of songs heused to sing and she fancied that she shouldnever hear music so sweet till that voice againsounded in her ears but now her mothertold her that she would not see the smile orhear the song of her father on which shewould drag a favorite wooden stool to hermother's feet and hide her face on her mother'slap and sob aloudrebut what saddened her most of all wasthat her mother seemed sick sick at heartand grew paler and paler and every day shespoke fewer words and those words she spokeseemed feebler to mathilde her mother hadsupported them both by spinning flax andlove of flowers her distaff was in her hands from morningto night and it was as much as she coulddo to support herself and mathilde by herceaseless labor iniathilde was already of someuse she could go to the merchant and buythe flax help to clean it and when it wasspun she could take it to the masterweaversfor sale but mathilde had remarked that forsome time the quantity which her mother spundiminished and every week the little pittanceshe had to receive diminished too she saidnothing to her mother but thought that forher mother's sake she must make some effortto keep poverty away from the door mathilde had often been to the marcheaux fleurs she had watched the flowersellers they came to the market and the flowerswhich were most readily disposed of it waswhen camellias came into fashion and mathildeobserved that whenever one was offered at a minor moralsmoderate price a buyer was always foundand now said she i think i can do somethingfor my mother and myself i will traincamellias i will bring them to the flowermarketif people will buy them of me ishall be happy she had only a few sous which had beengiven her at various times by the master weaverto whom she took her mother s flaxen threadand who had been struck by the child's modestand amiable demeanor but with these shewent to a nursery gardener and said she shouldlike to buy some camellia plants which shewished to rear till they grew into flowerthe gardener was pleased with her appearanceand said you shall have double the valueof the money you bring and you shall repayme when you are abler he told her toohow best to take care of the plants when towater them and in what temperature they bestlove of flowers thrived with what delight did she conveyhomethe pots in which her treasures were with what anxiety did she watch the growthof the flowers at last she saw them budone came forth like a carving of pure whitewax another bright and glowing as a rubyhow her heart leaped as she carried them tothe marche aux fleurs she scarcely knewwhat price to set on them a lady cameand inquired for how much she would sellthem twenty sous madame said mathildeher cheeks blushing like the red camellia itis far too little said the lady here are twofrancs my child and oh how her heartleaped as she danced homewards to tell hermother how happy she had been and to presentthe produce of her care her mothersmiled upon her but mathilde thought shehad never seen so sad a smile her motherwept they were not tears of pain but minor moralsmathilde fancied her mother had never lookedso pale and wanbut mathilde felt she must exert herselfthe more she doubled her stock of camellias and when she went to the marche aux fleursher stand was remarked for the beauty andvariety of the specimens she brought hercourteous and attractive manners won her manya purchaser of her flowers and those whobought once never failed to return againand to recommend her to their friends andacquaintance she would have been happy for her mothertoiled less at the spindle and mathilde wasable from the profits of her little trade tobring many comforts home but day afterday she perceived that her mother's voicegrew yet weaker her sight became dim andthe words of kindness which had every daybeen addressed to her when she came homelove of flowers were fewer and fewer till at last nothingwelcomed mathilde but a grasp of the handand a kind look from eyes that had almostlost their light mathilde sought and founda boy to take her flowers to market and gaveherself up to her sinking mother she called inthe neighboring apothecary who told her thatno medical aid could save her mother whoseframe was worn out and who was now dyingin peace in a few days she died mathildethrew the rarest of her camellias into the coffinand planted over her grave at pere la chaisea specimen of singular beauty go there atthe hour of sunrise and you will see herwatching

showing us papas saidgeorge that a great many of the virtuescommonly so called are not virtues unless theyare under the control of other virtues i thoughtperseverance too might be sometimes a falsevirtue for that a man mihi persevere in doingwrongthat is most true george and i am gladthat you are learning how to distinguish betweenwhat are real virtues and what are not between what are virtues sometimes and whatare virtues always and as i remember twocases one of vicious and another of virtuousperseverance they will serve to explain whatis good and what is evil in persevering conductperseverance a quarrel had taken place between twoclerks in a merchant's countinghouse jonasand jonathan the quarrel was of little importancein itself for it was merely as to thequantity of work that each had to do themerchant had given six letters to be copied jonas said that each should copy three jonathansaid that as they were not of the same lengthone should copy four and the other two theydisputed violently about it and from wordscame to blows jonas beat jonathan severelyand jonathan vowed that he would be revengedin this determination he persevered and it wasa part of every dayes thoughts how he couldinjure jonas jonas kept what is called the petty cash inthe merchant's counting house that is he wascharged with the payment of all the small sumsfor the ordinary expenses of the business andwas settled with by the merchant every week minor moralson his producing the accounts and the vouchersfor payment when any receipts were givenjonas was particularly careful to keep his documentsin order and jonathan who knew jonas'spride in having his cashbook right determinedto do all that he could to embarrass and confusehim whenever jonathan could lay his handsupon any voucher that jonas wanted to showthat his payments were regular jonathantook the opportunity when nobody was presenteither to burn or otherwise destroy itthis made jonas very miserable who neverfancied that his companion could have beenso wicked but jonas was bitterly distressedwhen on three following saturdays insteadof receiving the merchant's accustomed praisehe was reprimanded for negligence jonasprotested that he had been as careful as usualbut could not conceive how the documents haddisappeared he determined in future toperseverance lock them iip instead of leaving them underthe leads of the desks as he had hitherto donethe nextweek all jonasss accounts were ascorrect as usual and all the vouchers in orderand his tranquillity returned but it did not last long for jonathanfinding that he had not succeeded in his illnaturedattempt was resolved to injure jonaseven more seriously and one day when jonashad gone to the docks and had by accidentleft the key in his desk jonathan took a fivepoundnote out of the cashbox which jonaskept there and concealed it in another partof the desk he did not dare to steal it he would have been afraid of detection buthe knew how much jonas would suffer andhe persevered in making him sufferjonas came home and pat the keys inhis pocket he did not even recollect that hehad left them in the desk but the next day minor moralswhen he opened his desk to count the moneyin the cashbox a fivepound note was missingthis was indeed a sad discovery he rackedhis brains to remember whether he had madeany payment that he had not entered heinquired of jonathan whether he had seen himpay any money away jonathan professed tofeel for his distress while in fact he wasrejoicing in it and he was even much delightedwicked lad when he heard the merchantin his private room severely reproachingjonas for his carelessness a few weeks after jonas having occasionto ransack his desk for some papers foundthe fivepound note it never occurred tohim that anybody could have been so spitefulas to hide it in order to give him pain andhe supposed that he himself had by accidentstowed it away with other papers but hisjoy at finding it was even greater than hisperseverance distress at losing it he ran to the merchantand told him of his good fortune the merchantrecommended more caution in futurestill jonathan persevered in persecutingjonas and having been hitherto undetectedbecame bolder it was jonasss duty to takethe letters to the postofsce one day a letterof great importance containing a bill of exchangefor a large amount was missing themerchant had as usual intrusted the correspondenceto jonas's care and had left thecity for his country abode next day thefirst inquiry when the merchant came waswhether the letters had been despatched jonasburst into tears and said that the letter withthe remittance was not to be found what said the merchant with extreme displeasure iliad letter missing and looking on theground he saw the letter at jonas's feet wetand dirty as if it had been trampled on minor moralsthis had been also jonathan's doing he hadconcealed the letter the night before he hadflung it unperceived having himself troddenupon it under jonasss deskin this way many months passed alljonathan's conduct was the persevering annoyanceof jonas but he generally managed withso much cunning as to be undiscovered in hismalice but things went on so ill that themerchant dismissed them bothyears rolled by in which they had littleintercourse with one another jonas and jonathanin the progress of time became merchantsthemselves but nothing could eradicate fromjonathan's mind the determination to injureand if possible to ruin jonas and he atlast accomplished it though his own ruin wasat hand he undermined the credit of jonasby persevering indirect insinuations as to thestate of his affairs by doubts and intendsperseverance and shrugs of the shoulder by a succession ofunfounded reports and

for a small sum of moneyand are worn by hundreds of thousands ofthe classes whose garments were formerlymade of coarse wool or hemp the old mani speak of was jacquard and he was one ofthe great causes of this diffusion of enjoymentas i happened to be near the place of hisabode i determined to visit him and did soaccompanied by several friends it was a sunshiny day i remember andwe had a delightful walk along the marginof the rapid pthone a river renowned in historyand whose banks are still crowded withthe ruins of past time calling to mind thedays when every feudal chief was obliged toperseverance shut himself up in high and embattled towersbuilt often upon dangerous crags in orderto be secure from the attacks of some neighboringlord the petty sovereigns andthe petty feuds have passed away togethereverythingnow bears the face of security of industry of peace talking of the delightfulcontrast and hoping that nations wouldone day harmonize as the once contendingpeasantry of

clematis was minor moralsblended with the vine and together theymade the roof and the walls of the quietretreat where every day the venerable oldman was used to sit and to recall the eventsof his much chequered life some of thoseevents you shall hear as he himself relatedthem and you will see what perseverancevirtuous perseverance is and what virtuousperseverance can doi told jacquard that i was an englishmanand as he had been one of the benefactorsof my country i was come to thankhim how proud i am said he to bevisited by an englishman if i have everdone any good i owe the very first suggestionto england it was an english newspaperthat led me to occupy my thoughtswith mechanical improvements but for thatperhaps i should still have been a poor strawhatmaker in an obscure street at lyonsperseverance instead of the happy man you see me honoredby my native town recompensed by thegovernment pointing to the red ribbon whichhe wore at his buttonhole and pensionedby the state but how i enquired didyou owe to england your first success itwas he answered during the peace ofamiens and we were accustomed to meetin order to talk politics at a friend's house onthe quay it was there a translated extractfrom an english newspaper met my eyestating that a premium was offered by asociety in london to any one who wouldapply machinery to the manufacture of netsi meditated long upon the matter and aftermany attempts i made a machine by whichnets could be produced it was the first ofmy mechanical experiments and i will tellyou if you have the patience and the desireto hear me how that trifling affair was the minor moralsbeginning of my good fortune and my famenothing we assured him could gratify usmore than to continue his history wellthen said he i contrived a machine andmade a net by it and thought no more ofthe matter i carried the net about in mypocket and one day meeting with a friendwho had heard the paragraph of the englishpaper read i threw it to him saying thereis the difficulty got over and the net made and the matter passed out of my mind ihad persevered until i had succeeded andthere was an end of it sometime afterwardsi was much surprised at getting an orderfrom the prefect to appear at the prefectpalace i went and the prefect said he hadonly lately heard of my proficiency in the mechanicalarts it was a great mystery to me i really did not comprehend his meaningand i stammered out a sort of an apologyperseverance for not understanding him my net and themachine that made it had gone quite out ofmy head the prefect expressed surprise thati should deny my own abilities but at last heproduced the very net that i had made andwhich to me had seemed a very trifling affairas it was in reality i have orders from theemperor to send the machine to paris said theprefect from the emperor that's strangeindeed but you must give me time to makeit so i set about it and in a few weeksi completed it and trudged away with mymachine and a halfmanufactured net in itto the prefect he was very impatient to seeit work so i bid him count the number ofloops and then strike the bar with his foot he did so and another loop was added to thenumber great was the delight that he expressedand he told me that no doubt i shouldhear from him again i heard from him again minor moralsin truth very soon and in a way that perplexedme not a little for his first greeting was youmust go to paris m jacquard by his majesty'sorders to paris sir how can that be what have i done how can i leave my affairshere not only must you go to paris butyou must go today you must go immediately these were not times in which there was anyresisting the orders of authority so i said ifit must be so it must i will go home andpack up my baggage and i shall be ready toobey your commands no m jacquard said the prefect you cannot go home a carriageis waiting to take you to paris notgo home not say adieu to my wife not makeupmy luggage for a journey of leagues i have orders said the prefect to dispatchyou instantly you may send to your wife you may tell her to give to my messengeranything you desire to take i will provideperseverance you with money but there must be no delay'there was no arguing about the matter soi sent to my wife got a small bundle of clothes jumped into the carriage and away away we were off full gallop towards paris whenwe reached the first station i opened thedoor and i found myself stopped by a gendarmewho said to me sir if you pleaseyou are not to go out of my sight i foundi was a prisoner and escorted by militaryforce to the capital things were so managedat that time there was however no use incomplaining so i made the best of my fateand submitted in good humor i reached paris for the first time in mylife and strange was my introduction therei was escorted to the conservatory and whomshould i see there but napoleon and carnotcarnot said to me suddenly are you theman that can do what omnipotence cannot minor moralsdo can you tie a knot in a string on thestretch v i was overwhelmed with the presenceof the emperor and the abruptness ofhis minister and knew not what to answerbut napoleon spoke very condescendingly tomeabout my discovery told me he wouldprotect me and urged me to go on with mymechanical pursuits materials were brought me and i wasdirected to make a netproducing machine inthe conservatory which i did at that time a superb shawl was beingwoven for the empress josephine and for itsproduction they were employing a very costlyand complicated loom a loom upon whichmore than twenty thousand francs had beenexpended it appeared to me that the sameeffect might be produced by a less perplexingmachinery and i recollected having seen amodel by vaucauson in which i thought aperseverance principle was developedwhich i could applyto the desired purpose long thought andperseverance enabled me to produce the mechanismthat bears my name when i hadsucceeded the emperor conferred this decorationupon me and granted me a pensionof crowns but on returning to lyons far differentwas my destiny when i endeavored to introducemy machine the workmen broke outinto open revolt i was everywhere denouncedas the enemy of the people as the man whohad been scheming the destruction of theirtrade and the starvation of themselves andtheir families three plots were laid to assassinateme and twice i had great difficulty inescaping with my life so strong was the tideof prejudice and indignation that my machinewas ordered to be openly destroyed by thepublic authorities it was broken to pieces minor moralsin the great square of the city the ironwas sold for old iron the wood for firewoodthink what a shipwreck of all my hopes i did not quite lose courage the successfulcompetition of foreigners and the consequentdecline of trade in france led someintelligent manufacturers a few years afterto think of the man whose discovery mightperhaps bring some relief to that depressionunder which they labored they found strengthof mind to make another experiment itsucceeded silks of greater beauty were introducedat a lower cost there was a dawnof prosperity and it has continued to shineof that machine which had been devoted toignominy and destruction i have now seenthousands introduced and there is now scarcelyany man so blind or so ignorant as not toacknowledge that its introduction has been agreat blessing it has given labor to tens ofperseverance tliousauds and i have lad a complete recompensefor all i have gone through we talked of these and other matters tillthe shades of coming twilight bid us departthe happy old man is still in my memory a striking instance of virtuous perseverancecrowned with fit rewardsgoodnatureif goodnature is not a virtue it is at allevents a very agreeable companions said arthurto george as they were talking over the meritsand demerits of one of their school fellows goodnature is called a virtue in mostbooks i thinks answered george and yetif nature gave a man the goodness i do notquite see how it can be a virtue for which anymerit is due to him for a virtue papa hasoften told us is acquired by habit and alwayssupposes that we make some sacrifice of presentpleasure but we will talk about it to papaand mamma when we get homesand so they did and mr howard was muchgratified to find that his boys began nowgoodnature habitually to discern the true characteristics ofvirtue for he knew that the practice of virtuewould be sure to follow the knowledge of it goodnatures he said is indeed a mostattractive quality but its title to the name ofvirtue depends to a great extent upon the constitutionalcharacter of the person who possessesit it may be highly honorable to its owneras where the influences of illnature have beensubduedjby severe and longcontinued strugglesall the goodnature that is acquired is virtue and very meritorious virtue too but its exhibitioncan only be in words or deeds of prudenceand benevolence the result to human happinesswill be the same whether prudence orgoodnature is the cause of right conduct yetthe merit of the same conduct may be verydifferent for in one case there may be notemptation to do wrong no disposition to misconductor illhumor the disposition may minor moralshave been made so gentle by native temperamentas not to feel any desire to give pain inanother case the impulse may be to act amissand the stronger the impulse the greater willbe the virtue of conquering it i think yourmamma can tell you a story in illustration ofwhat i say i have known two little girls grace andjulia said mrs howard the one was thegentlest creature that nature ever formed evenfrom her earliest infancy the other as passionateand as untractable as a wolf's cub butby virtuous effort she at last subdued her naturaltemper and as she grew older became one ofthe most amiable and delightful of womenthey were not sisters but companions andi have often heard of julia's rebellious disobedienceand of the plague she was to herfamily to her governess and her schoolfellowshow it happened that grace loved julia so well goodnature i can scarcely tell for it seemed to me thatjulia was constantly acting the part of a tyrantand exacting from grace a thousand serviceswhich she had no right to expect julia hadher fits of generosity and of affection and theseperhaps had won over grace who bore withoutcomplaint and without reproach all julia's illtemperperhaps grace knew more of julia'sgood qualities than other people knew for ingeneral julia was thought to be a very disagreeablegirl whom nobody cared about atall events nobody cared about pleasing her on one occasion julia had been venting herillhumor in the sittingroom upon one of herjunior schoolfellows something had put juliaout of temper which was very easily done andso to gratify her spitefulness she tried to snatcha book out of the hands of the younger girlwho not surrendering it at once was violentlypushed away and fell on her forehead whichm minor moralswas much bruised by the fall the governessheard julia scolding and fancying that asusual she was playing the despot came intothe room instead of apologising and expressingregret julia spoke impertinently toher mistress and ran into the schoolroomwhere she slapped the door and locked it onthe inside in absolute defiance she not onlydid this but she put the poker in the fire andsaid to herself in the midst of her passionliuonh be punished the governess cameto the door and required julia to open it sherefused at first but being apprehensive the doormight be forced she at last opened it ran to thefire drew out the red hot poker which shebrandished and told the governess to comenear her if she dared you may fancy whatan effect such daring insubordination as thishad upon the governess she left the schoolroomand julia there to reflect a little upongoodnature her violent and unladylike conduct and soondid julianss conscience smite her and she was aswretched as contrition and selfcondemnationcould make her she was severely punishedby exclusion from that schoolroom where hermisbehaviour had been so outrageous and intruth the schoolgirls were not sorry she waskept away they loved their governess andwere indignant at the manner in which juliahad behaved towards her they loved thelittle girl whom julia had treated so unkindlyand when the time was expired during whichshe was banished from the schoolroom theyfelt no willingness to make any advances orto say or do anything that should alleviatejulia's sufferingnot so however grace at the firstmoment which her governess allowed her sheflew to julianss room whom she found in tearsgrace wiped the tears away from her cheeksr minor moralsand they only streamed the more grace couldnot utter a word but smiled and julia sawthat her friend had been weeping too shefelt as if her stubbornness and illhumor weremelting away from her mind and shakinggrace by the hand she said oh grace i will try indeed i wills grace kissed herand led her to the schoolroomit was a terrible struggle of all the girlsthere was not one that welcomed her shesaw some of them frowning others turnedaway from her several engaged in conversationthat they might appear not to noticeher julianss heart felt heavy twice or thriceshe was about to give way to her pride andto say aloud that she did not care for one ofthem but in the midst of her perturbationthe little girl whose book she had snatchedaway came running to her and said kindlyi am glad to see you here again andgoodnature julia exclaimed have you pardoned me in a tone so novel and so imploring thatmany of the girls were moved to pity oh yes yes v said the little girl i have thoughtabout you twenty and twenty times and oftenhave grace and i talked about you i amsure we shall be friendsfrom that moment the seeds of selfcontrolbegan to spring up in julia's mind everydaysome little conquest was made and howgrace rejoiced to find her friend graduallybecome all that she wished her to be tograce julia confided all her anxieties oftenand often when she really meant to do rightwhen she was striving to obtain the masteryover her illhumor she was misunderstoodshe did not get credit even for her resolutionsand for her exertions she had been so longan object of dislike that scarcely anybodywas willing to give her any further trial she minor moralshad been judged so often and so often condemnedthat her companions were unwillingto think she could ever be worthy of theirregard she had thus not only the difficultyof subduing her own vicious tendencies butwhat appeared to her a greater difficulty namelyto remove the prejudices against her whichexisted in the minds of others she was not without encouragement however for grace who always felt a remarkablepartiality for her a partiality which had beenproof even against all julianss defects a partialitywhich had forgiven so much unkindnessgrace i say had become attached to juliawith extraordinary affection it is true thatjulia had not been all that grace fanciedshe should have liked in the friend of herbosom but she now found her constantlyattempting to become a model of goodnessand as grace was disposed to do her moregoodnature isthan justice towards grace all julia's virtueswere exhibited because they were so muchappreciated so kindly welcomed and gracewas julia's perpetual advocate a favorite herselfshe gradually insinuated her favorite intothe favor of others the friendship betweengrace and julia seemed if that were possibleto strengthen every day julia felt no smallportion of gratitude mingled with her love for on no occasion had grace forsaken herin the perilous moment in that crisis whenit seemed doubtful whether right or wrongwould have been her choice it was gracewho determined that the balance should inclineto the side of virtue and in the mind of gracegentle and good as she was there wasperhaps a small portion of pride in that shehad been able to influence the selfwilled juliaand to make her so kind and amiable as shewas now become minor morals grace and julia are grown to womanhood and it would not be easy to say which ofthem is the happier or which the better eachis at the head of a family each the objectof the most affectionate attachment from allaround them their mutual friendship hasnever subsided never slackened and it seemsas if it would descend to their children virtuouseffort has done for julia everything thatnatural gentleness did for grace if you wereto speak to grace of her own amiable tempershe would say that she had no merit at all for that she was born without violent passionsand deserved no credit for resisting what wasnever a temptation but she would break outin eloquent praises of julia and tell you thatyou might there study a specimen of virtue that you might there see the might of goodresolutions that you might there learn how aperfect character was to be formed in spite ofgoodnature all the tendencies and trials of an infirmnature ask julia how she managed to triumphover her infirmity she will assure you themerit was not hers she will attribute all tograce's gentleness and kindness both graceand julia my children are objects fit forimitation grace vias virtuous juliatined to be linked together these twentieswere registered and seated on the

then i replied you have no objectionto use their services you will tolerate theirpresence while they labour for you even toweariness you will permit them to stand butnot to sit down before you but you must allow there is somethingnaturally disgusting about the african blacks'said the boldest of the company in factthey are a different race from ours and havea disagreeable smellthe persecuted always

toexcite the inhumanity of the people of englandagainst the poor bavarian girls who sell broomsin the street by abusing them as a stinkingrace now to me the stench of persecutionis of all stenches the most offensively but you cannot deny that the african isreally a different animal from the european he has a skull of another shape the musclesof his legs are differently arrangedand suppose it were

i felt as if icould walk no farther but then i thoughtagain that the large boat must belong to thecruel white men and was there to carry usover the great water and i trembled andi said to my heart never shall i see myfather never shall i see the village where iwas born we were led to the shore andsoon there came several of the cruel whitemen to look at us they pushed us fromone side to another turned us round theywould not give the money that the blacknobility of skin man asked they made a great noise theylaughed aloud it was a shocking laugh whilewe were so wretched i did not understand

the whiteman shook his head and he poured out thesever from his bag upon the sand and hecalled more white men who were his servants and they rolled four barrels out of the greatboat and upon the four barrels they placedtwo muskets but our black master againshook his head and held up two fingers of hisleft hand and pointed to the barrels and thenheld up one finger and pointed to the musketsthen the

high up the ridges of the andesthey made their way to the habitationof a distinguished cacique or indian chiefcollins fame had gone before him and hemet with the most hearty reception anddoubly hearty was it because the cacique wasill and fancied the white stranger might bringnobility of skin him relief colline like most seamen knewsomething of the usual treatment for maladiessuch simple prescriptions as perspiration incases of fever gargles for sore throat and soforth the little he knew reckoned for muchwhere less was known he had learned thatthe rapidity of the pulse the color of thetongue were among the symptoms by whichdisease might be ascertained he bad someordinary remedies for a burn a cut and thecommon accidents of life he prescribed forthe cacique and had the good fortune toperceive a sensible improvement the cacique was a man highly veneratedby the indians he was a descendant of theperuvian incas and had been initiated by hisforefathers into many of their religious mysterieshe was also the depository of muchof their traditional history and was lookedupon as a man destined by himself or his minor moralsdescendants to recover for the red men theland of their ancestors from those who hadviolently possessed themselves of it such aman exercised great influence over the widelybut thinly scattered remains of the old peruvianpeople he had visited most of the spotswhich they deemed sacred he had preservedand diffused among them the names of theirancient kings and priests and heroes heknew where their battles had been foughtand where their altars and temples had beenraised a sense of gratitude for benefits receivedawakened in the cacique's mind the strongestaffection for colline and as soon as colinhad sufficiently learnt the language there wasthe completest communication of their thoughtsand feelings to one another one day thecacique told colline a most important secretthat he was the possessor of the quipos nobility of skin the famous historical records of the peruviannation records said to contain the annals ofthe ancient incas for three thousand yearsconsisting of innumerable and curiouslycoloredknots which had been added by the initiatedfrom time to time and for the reading of whichnone but the incas possessed the key in hisconfidence for couine he exhibited to himthis precious treasure they were in a largebox on which were engraved divers allegoricalstories connected with the quipos representingmost prominently the ancient temple of thesun where the old peruvians had carried ontheir mysterious and costly devotions thebox had been splendidly gilded in former times but its lustre was faded and colline who hadlearned the art of gilding in europe undertookto restore it to its original beauty hedid this nothing could have been so acceptableto the cacique who watched the progress minor moralsof the work from day to day and looked uponit with absolute ecstacy when it was completedhe then embraced colline and said in themost enthusiastic language friends for ever i will be your father now you shall marrymy daughterthe cacique had two children whomcolline had seldom seen though he had frequentlyheard among the tribe the praises ofthe daughter's beauty the son was almosthabitually wandering and when he camehome he always looked upon colline with somuch jealousy and suspicion that his presencewas considered perilous even the caciquesaw him without pleasure for his illhumorvented itself so frequently and so passionatelythat his father was afraid hospitality itselfwould be violated by himthe american indians are as implacable intheir hatred as they are fervent in their friendnobilityof skin slip and no sooner had the cacique's sonheard of his father's intention towards cominesthan he endeavoured to persuade his sisterkanka to join with him in a plot for thestrangers destruction kanka appeared tolend a willing ear but it was to save and notto sacrifice colline she had conceived anaffection for her proposed husband he hadbeen more in her company ever since thecacique had spoken of his purpose and shewas full of admiration for his many to hersplendid talents and acquirements she listenedto his adventures with extreme delight whenhe told her of the world that was far off overthe seas of its mighty cities its fleets andarmies its courts and gardens its superbedifices the bridges upon its rivers it roadsand the carriages rolling over them its cultivatedlands its birds and cattle the richdresses of its inhabitants she looked around minor moralsher thinking of the contrast between all thisand the bare andean mountain where she wasborn then sometimes the thought cameacross her like a child's fancy that collinemight take her to see all those wondroussights and bring her back again to her nativehome to tell the indians that she herself hadseen them and that there was no fiction nofalsehood in the story the marriage took place and with all thesolemnities which are usual among the indianskanka was much loved and as the descendantof the cacique himself descended from themost illustrious of the inca race nothing waswanting to give interest to the celebrationbut the brother was absent and he wasknown to be maturing his purposes of illwillhe had not indeed concealed his evil dispositionand when he left his father's houseit was in the season of spring just before thenobility of skin marriage lie publicly said tlie flowers areon the trees before the fruits ripen the enemyshall be placed from the stem whither hewent nobody knew he took with him twoyoung indians as his companions but did notsay farewell to his father or his sister a fewdays before he left he said to kanka faresthe pure mountain stream that mingles witha foreign puddle to her he had been generallykind and never had he uttered so severea reproach kanka answered more proudlyrolls the stream when it joins a current brighterand stronger than its own on which he lookedat her with a look of scorn and silently quittedher presencecolline did kanka justice she was so tractableso teachable so gifted with goodnatureyet withal so dignified and intelligent thathe was well content to renounce the thoughtsof his european home except when sometimes minor moralskanka said lie would accompany him thither that they would descend the mountains togetherand find some ship to convey them tothe other world and to bring them back againto the cacique's abode kanka engaged collineto adopt the indian costume in order thatshe might adorn it with her own diligenthands and so he did and the headdress ofplumes he wore was the most beautiful thathad ever been seen among the indian peopleshe winged his arrows with splendid feathersand plaited the gay sandals which decoratedhis feetthe autumnal season came and themenace of the brother was perpetually ringingin kanka's ear for the fruits were beginningto ripen and she was sure that couine's lifewas exposed to peril the cacique had indeedcharged kanka to watch her husbandwith particular attention to accompany himnobility of skin in his hunting expeditions and to take everyprecaution against surprise but precautionswere in vain against the determined and exasperatedhostility of the young indian kankaeras told one day when at a short distance fromhome accompanied by colline that her brotherhad been seen in the neighborhood and shesaid to her husband let us return i willseek my brother i will tell him how happyi am i am sure i shall teach him to loveyou for he loves me and we shall all dwelltogether in peace hardly had she said thisere an arrow passed by and fixed itselfquivering in her husbands right arm hefell and kanka shrieked for help she withdrewthe arrow with difficulty she saw thatit was poisoned colline turned deathly pale and kanka hanging over him sucked theblood from the wound in this position shewas found by the old cacique who then as he minor moralsfrequently did had followed their footstepsunseen with some difficulty they lifted collinefrom the ground and conveyed him homeit was long doubtful whether he would recover but the prompt assistance of kanka at themoment of attack and her most assiduous caresand thoughtful attentions brought about hisconvalescence but added to the anxieties of allin less than a month another attempt wasmade upon collins life the old caciqueirritated by his son's misconduct had declaredhe would disinherit him and this as may wellbe supposed added fuel to the flames of theyoung man's vengeful passions one midnight the cacique's habitationwas in a blaze it had been set fire to by hisson who did not purpose to destroy his fatherand his sister who he fancied might easilyescape while couine confined to his bed byhis wounds would probably be the only vienobilityor skin tim his calculations failed they all escapedand saved their most valuable treasures theirquipos and their antiquities all that happenedwas to be exposed to the storm withouta habitation until they could make theirway to a neighboring indians choza andset about rebuilding their own but as theyhad now been involved in a common dangerthey felt more closely united to one anothercouine recovered but his existence wasmade miserable by the constant plots of theyoung cacique plots in which he had nowengaged other indians by representing tothem that colline was one of the race thathad invaded robbed and ruined the indiancountry that had massacred their kings andpriests and taken possession of the land oftheir fathers the old cacique had been remonstratedwith for harboring the intruderand had been told that unless colline removed minor moralshe would inevitably be subjected to a crueland violent death the cacique only askeda few days to arrange matters and promisedthat couine should quietly depart but heengaged them by a solemn vow that theywould not commit any act of outrage andthat they would prevent any from being committedfor the three next suns and with allthe courage and calmness he could musterhe sought colline and kanka and spoke tothem thus the old man's heart is sad my children and sad must be the words of his tonguebut the bitter thing must be uttered and thebitter sorrow must be borne if i loved kankawell no less have i loved colline he cameto me a stranger i made him a son lovecould do no more now we must part andoh that we could part as we met it is vainto talk about what must be what must be innobility of skin spite of all our talk if couine stay lie isdoomed to die and kanka would not buy liesstaying here at the price of his life's kandaharfallen on her husbands breast utteringthat she would go too or that they would dietogether but the cacique continued jo that cannot be kanka must dwellin the abode of her fathers if she go withcolline it will be the destruction of both orof all of us the indians will not hear ofher departure we will go together to theboundaries of the land and that before sunset for the hours are numbered on which i cananswer for couine's safety i know not howto dismiss him once i had treasures but ihave none of value save the records of mynation i cannot trust them to the keeping ofmy son i will give them to colline heshall deposit them in a place of safety amongthe white people and in some future timeq minor moralstheywill be found again come my children let us go forth thus suddenly was the link broken whichbound colline to the indian family hisspirit was sorrowful but he saw there wasno choice no escape they rose togetherthey travelled through the night each in turnbearing the cacique treasure they reachedthe boundary by the following evening itwas twilight colline preceded his companionsonly a few steps he turned round they haddisappeared no doubt the parting wordwas as the old man had said too bitter forutterance gloomily and alone colline pursued hisjourney the quitobox had been carefullyslung for the convenience of carrying it hefound a basket of food all the remains ofwhat they had brought from the cacique'shome after many days travel colline reachednobility of skin the habitation of some spanish south americans he there changed his indian

considerable perplexityarthur's latin exercise book wasmissing with his exercise in it nobody knewwhere it was he did not know himself whetherhe had left it at school or brought ithome sure it was

mr howardafter half an hour had been wasted in thefruitless search and thus you have causedyourself a great annoyance which might havebeen prevented by a very little caresorder in mr howard's family all such events werewont to lead to useful conversation on thevarious topics started so it happened nowand order was the order of the day i have seen many cases where a wisearrangement of matters said mr howard'has given to a man of inferior industryinferior zeal and inferior talent great advantageover him who possessed all these qualitiesin a far superior degree in ordinary affairsa habit of order is a source of more comfortthan you would suppose could possibly dependupon or be influenced by it it doubles theusefulness of all the stores we possess by placingthem where they are immediately at handthe possession which cannot be called into thefield when wanted is of no more value thanan estate in the moona smaller portion of knowledge wellordered and arranged in the mind is more minor moralsvaluable than a larger portion which is in astate of confusion no matter how costly thetreasures you collect unless they are accessiblethey are of little use they may be evenan incumbrance i remember during the peninsularwar seeing some soldiers so overladenwith pillage as to impede their march so thatthey either lost their lives or fell into thehands of the enemy knowledge my

these become rubbishwhen they become unmanageable marmaduke method was a boy who madehis way through the world and established agreat reputation and died possessed of greatwealth and he owed all his success to hishabits of regularity and order he was notorder remarkable for talent not even remarkablefor anything but this one circumstance butthe practice which he had adopted in earlylife of putting everything straight as hecalled it left much time on his hands enabledhim to enjoy many pleasures more than hiscompanions spared him many vexations andbrought at last distinction and opulence tohimself and his children marmaduke was the child of very poorparents they could afford him only a smallportion of instruction so they paid for himtwopence a week at the parish school whenvery young he was observed by his motherstanding on tiptoe and endeavoring to drivea large nail into the wall with a stone hecould hardly lift she found this was to hanghis hat upon for he had been much distressedthe day before by seeing his father sit downon his hat which he had incautiously left on minor moralsthe chair prom that day however the hatwas always either on marmadukes head oron the nail or in the appointed place at schoolsoon after he found the means of getting twoother nails on which he suspended his bestpair of shoes and always took care that theyhung straight for it is not more useful toput hera in their right places than to putthem there tidily and carefully by and byhe got a little shelf on which the two or threesmall books he had were kept nice and cleanthey were not soiled with dirt nor rumpledwith dogsears but spoke for themselves infavor of the attentive little boy his clotheswere coarse but always neatly buttoned hiscommon shoes were old but always clean andcarefully tied he could not bear to see anythingwrong which a little trouble would putright so that when he was seven years old hisschoolfellows gave him the nickname of mrorder orders a name which he well deserved helaughed at the boy who first called him soand never felt an instants annoyance whenall the other boys took the hint and calledhim mr orderly too before he was nine years old his motherdied and his father removed him from schooland obtained a place where he got sixpencea day for cleaning knives and forks and shoesand running such errands as were required he became a favorite with the servantssince he did everything so cheerfully and welleverybody knew where to find what armaturehad put away and all his doings appearedto the greatest advantage from the order inwhich he left them his knives and forkswere always arranged side by side as brightand regular as attention could place themif he cleaned the plate it seemed to shinewith double lustre as one piece reflected back minor moralsthe polish of the next if he was sent onmessages he so arranged it as to go the leastdistance and to employ the least possible timeby taking them all in order which was also putting everything straight he had intruth a love for right lines of all sorts andreceived so much pleasure from the best arrangementof things that order and virtueand happiness were very much alike to himhe had not read the poets nor heard theverse which says that order is heaven's firstlaws he did not know by what wonderfulregulations suns and stars are kept in theirplaces seasons return night and day succeedone another and generation follows generationbut he had a sense a tact which taught himthat order was beauty and that order waswisdom and the want of order was thereforediscordant to his mind so he naturally soughtto put things straight and when he hadorder done so he felt as if he had done a gooddeed and one that brought with it instantrecompensethe lady of the house where marmadukewas had occasion to go into the kitchen oneday and saw how very nicely he had done hiswork she spoke of it to her husband whohad also marked with what neatness andorder marmaduke arranged the shoes he hadblacked and the clothes he had brushed the gentleman recommended marmaduketo a neighboring chemist and that love oforder which was quite a habit and almost apassion with the boy soon showed itself inthe chemist's shop marmaduke was verycareful not to disturb anything that was inplace but his anxiety to have everythingstraight soon enabled him to arrange mattersthat had been before neglected and great wasthe comfort which his master found in the minor moralshumble services of the lad the pins whichwere before scattered on the floor were nowinvariably collected on a pincushion the penswhich had been thrown about in differentplaces were now always found in the inkstandthe empty vials were now constantlyplaced in order according to their sorts andsizes and the rags and bits of paper whichwere before swept every evening out of theshop were now collected by marmadukeand by the chemist's consent sold to the ragcollector at the end of the week for a fewpence which served as pocket money formarmaduke and with which he began hislittle fortune every penny so collected heentered in an account book and thus thevalue of money was habitually present to hismind and as he also entered every farthinghe expended the entry being in view wheneverhe opened his book served as a checkorder upon any improper oatltiy he thus learnedtoo by his own little affairs to keep accountscorrectly and he was at last allowed to makeentries in the books of the chemist hishabits of neatness were such that though hewrote indifferently his love for having everythingstraight made his writing plain andclear time improved his hand and he wassoon trusted to keep the journal and theledger of the tradei need not tell you that a boy so orderlywas very attentive to his person his coatsand trowsers lasted longer than those of mostboys of his age because he was accustomedto be so careful of them one thing he didwhich was of real use to the chemist hecopied into a book every prescription thatcame in vith its date and cost and madea complete index of all the articles it conesminor moralsgained and of the initials or signatures ofthe physician that signed it he thus gota great deal of medical knowledge and wasable at any time to refer to the medicine hehad prepared for a particular person oneday when he heard of a young lady who had beck poisoned in consequence of a chemists boy having sold her oxalic acid instead of epsomsalts he had great pleasure on reflecting thatsince he came to the chemist s no one mistakehad been made if you had asked himhow he managed to be so fortunate he wouldtell you it was by keeping things all straightand so indeed it was marmaduke grew to manhood and he hadthe satisfaction of thinking that ever since theage of nine he had provided for himself henot only had been of no expense to his fatherbut he had saved thirty pounds to which heorder was now able to add ten pounds a year moreso that lie now felt himself in a situation ofwhat seemed to him independencebut though the chemist had never toldmarmaduke how sensible he was of all the usehe had been to him and though marmadukenever took to himself any credit because hebelieved he had been only doing his duty toa kind and considerate master marmadukecould not but perceive that the tone in whichhe was spoken to was more and more friendly and the thought did sometimes pass throughhis mind that he might become the master inthat very shop where he had entered so poorand young a servant and if it were ever so iwould put things straighter he said to himselfand spend some money in improving the shop'sappearance and making it more attractive tocustomers one evening when the chemist was unwell minor moralsand marmaduke had been counselling him touse a prescription which had been very muchpraised by the customers of the shop forcuring the complaint under which he wassuffering he said to marmaduke give meyour hand boy i i have long intended to tellyou how well pleased i have been with yourconduct ever since you came to me i havealways admired your love of order yourthoughtfulness and prudence you have beenobedient to me and well behaved to my customersnow i want a little rest

yourcare at all events i shall make the experimentmarmaduke methods name was soon addedto the firm and inscribed in gold letters overthe door of the shop i don't tell you aithhow much pride marmaduke looked up to seethepainter changing the inscription but hispride had in it nothing that did him injuryor injured anybody else it was realizing tohimself a dream in which he had once thoughtit presumptuous almost criminal to indulgebut now that his orderly character and wishto set all things straight had full play thechanges he introduced were such as excitedeverybody's attention though nobody calledthem rash or improper it was not long beforethe chemist's portion of profits of the businesswere really larger than when he had the managementof it so that without any detrimentr minor moralsto himself he had done marmaduke a mostimportant service and this my children isoften the case with virtuous actions theybenefit the person served and that without anysacrifice to the virtuous

wasnot able to solve a miner possesses aningot of silver it comes into the possessionof a silversmith without any blame on hispart he doubles its value by making it intoa cup to which of the two ought it tobelong vohp said arthur they should sell thecup and divide the proceeds between them'but that is not the question now it iswhat does justice require as between the twoparties supposing one of them only was tohave the cup said edith would give the cup tojustice the miner for he produced the metal andwithout his labor the cup could never havebeen made at all he was the first cause ofits being made and i said george would give it tothe silversmith because the metal was worthnothing until it was turned to some use andit was the silversmith s art and knowledgethat made it useful i rather agree with edith said arthur for the miner is the more important personto be protected the finding the material ismore useful to society than the forming itinto shape the silversmith could do nothingwithout the miner but the miner suppliesmany trades besides the silversmithlet us look a little closer into the matterchildren said mr howard justice asfar as it is useful is an instrument of happinessall its value consists in this it is to minor moralsprevent unhappiness that we seek to preventinjustice now which of the two would suffer leastpain by being deprived of the cup i thinkit would be the miner and which wouldexperience most pleasure in having the cupawarded to him in my judgment it wouldbe the silversmith and if it be so the questionis solvedjustice requires rewards when rewards arenecessary to increase happiness or to preventmisery justice requires punishment whenpunishment would add to human happiness orlessen human suffering where there is nomischief there should be no punishmentwhen punishment will not prevent mischiefor its consequences there is no use in inflictingit the less of punishment the betterbecause the less of pain the better the ruleis always the same i repeat it to you myjustice children in a hundred ways judge of everythingby the happiness or misery which itproduces or removes your business in theworld is to change things that are evil

condemned the ratto die how can you treat me so unjustly vsaid the rat this house is as much mine asyour masters i was born in it and so weremy forefathers you are the intruders andtook possession against all right and justiceit is not just to let me starve and it is veryunjust indeed to punish me with death forindulging in a natural propensity which isyours and your master's as well as minenow what could the butler say in reply tothe rat minor morals oh said george the butler should havesaid that the cheese was his master's propertyand that the rat was a robber and deservedtransportation at least if not hangingthe rat would have liked transportationvery well said arthur but when ratsoffend however small the offence they aresure of capital conviction'well now papa responded edith idon't think that is just there should besome difference in the punishment of differentsins even in the case of a poor rati believe answered mr howard thatif you get no other guide than what is calledjustice in the matter the rat would have agood chance of escape and could he give afee and a brief to a clever barrister a prettystrong case of injustice could be made outagainst the butler but the rat is here anintruder upon human enjoyment and therejustice would be a loss of no small sum of pleasureif he were not dealt with by summary judgmentall that benevolence can plead forhim is that he shall be put out of existencewith the least possible pain a poor man owed a rich man a sum ofmoney it was justly the rich man's due but the poor man was unable to pay the debtat the moment when the rich man claimed itthe rich man arrested the poor man andjustice and the laws decided that the poor manshould be sent to prison there to pay bypersonal suffering for his incapacity to dischargethe debt the rich man exacted nothingbut what was strictly is but his conductwas the opposite of virtuous there is a curious phrase sometimes madeuse of by lawyers the greatest right thegreatest wrong which when it means anythingmeans that law and justice may be the minor moralscauses of imman misery and that when theyare so they ought to be set aside one day i saw a man strike another manaviolent blow in the face it would perhapshave been just to return the blow but wasit not more prudent more benevolent andhence more virtuous to refrain assuredly so in the case in question theman who struck the blow was in a state ofextreme irritation he had lost the power ofjudgment by exasperation the man whoreceived the blow had the wisdom to avoidasking whether justice required him to retaliatein the same offensive and violent way heasked what duty what virtue demanded andfound that they demanded forbearance heforbore the man who had injured him notonly relented but was overcome with sorrowhe felt that the injustice was on his sidehe felt that the man whom he had struckjustice might justly and even with the work's approvalhave used towards him similar orgreater violence his hesitating to do so

excellent thing butit is not because it is justice but because itis an instrument of happinessthe young people expressed a desire toknow how they were to distinguish what isjust from what is virtuous and mr howardthus answered their inquiries the world calls its laws and its usagesjustice for the most part they are so andin countries where instruction is spreadingthey become more so every day wheneverthe object of laws is thoroughly understoodlaws will be only a means to an end and thatend will be happiness whenever any conductis on the whole useful to mankind thequestion of its justice or injustice is a veryneedless one for to say that if it is justit cannot but be useful is to make justiceand usefulness the same thing as they oughtjustice indeed to be never therefore set up norallow

everybody canjudge but of justice there may be a hundreddissentient opinionsancient timeshow comes it papa that there is generallysuch a respect for ancient times inquired george one day after reading aspeech in which respect for the wisdom ofancestors was made a reason for not alteringsome foolish usage it is a sad prejudice said mr howard i once heard a man say he had no wishto appear wiser than his forefathers and peopleapplauded him j though had they reflectedthat nobody can have too much wisdom andthat it is the best part of wisdom to add towisdom they might have thought differentlya philosopher remarked that the same peoplewho are most loud in praise of past time areancient times those who are always insisting on the superiorityof old men over young ones nowancient days are the
